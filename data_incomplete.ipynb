He saw it over the Western Ridge this morning, said he would have thought it was the setting sun if it for the time of day. Apparently the cloud glows in a variety of colors, perhaps changing from observer to observer, although all report a low whistling when it draws near. One death has already been attributed to the glowcloud. But listen, probably nothing. If we had to shut down the town for every mysterious event that at least one death could be attributed to, never have time to do anything, right? what the Secret Police are saying, and I agree, although I would not go so far as to endorse their suggestion to directly at the cloud, shrieking and waving your arms, just to see what it The Apache Tracker, and I remind you that this is that white guy who wears the huge and cartoonishly inaccurate Indian headdress, has announced that he has found some disturbing evidence concerning the recent incident at the Night Vale Post Office, which has been sealed by the City Council since the great screaming that was heard from it a few weeks ago.

Seems perfectly happy and healthy, but floating about four feet off the ground next to the sink. seem to be able to move from its current hoverspot. If you pet him, he purrs, and rub on your body like a normal cat if you get close enough. Fortunately, because right by the sink, it was pretty easy to leave some water and food where he could get it, and nice to have a station pet. Wish it trapped in a hovering prison in the bathroom, but listen, no pet is perfect. It becomes perfect when you learn to accept it for what it is.

      "jesse thorn Hey all, Jesse. As 2020 draws to a close, think about what thankful for, other willing to drawing to a close. What got you through the year? Odds are, if hearing my voice, public radio was one of the things. Public radio gave you accurate, dependable news about the election on the pandemic, information about local stories that matter to you. You got fun and fascinating interviews from shows like Bullseye . If you wanna show your gratitude at the end of this year, consider supporting your local public radio station. Public radio stations really need your help right now, more than ever. And really easy to do! Just go to and give whatever you can. And thanks. music Gentle, trilling music with a steady drumbeat plays under the dialogue. promo Speaker : Bullseye with Jesse Thorn is a production of MaximumFun.org and is distributed by NPR. [Music fades out.] music from the album Thunder, Lightning, Strike by The Go! Team. jesse Bullseye . Jesse Thorn. If a fan of comics, odds are familiar with Adrian Tomine already. Maybe you read his series Optic Nerve or know his books, like Killing and Dying and Shortcoming . reminiscent of Daniel Klaus or Jaime Hernandez, maybe Harvey Pekar: dark, realistic, but with an edge of humor as well. And even if you a fan of comics, probably seen work. done several covers for the New Yorker , including a couple recently that illustrate the absurdity, frustration and isolation many people are experiencing after being home so long. Messy apartments, dates over video chat, Daniel Tiger episodes playing on repeat as kids climb up the walls. got a new book out now. called The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist . And in it, he takes a little bit of a different approach. For one, the presentation. The book looks like a notebook, each page written on graph paper. also autobiographical. Tomine recounts book tours, trips to the doctor, even an interview he did on Fresh Air . Conducting our interview with Adrian is Brian Heater. Brian is an editor for TechCrunch and the host of the podcast Recommended if You Like . interviewed Adrian many times before and has seen him go from a small-print indie comics artist to, these days, a real big-deal comics artist and a screenwriter. [Music fades in.] So. get into it. Brian Heater and Adrian Tomine. music Light, airy music. brian heater Adrian Tomine, thank you so much for joining us on Bullseye . adrian tomine Hi Brian. How you doing? brian I am doing well, all things considered. How is the book tour going for you so far? adrian [Laughs.] The book tour, I even know exactly book tour you were referring to [laughs] when you asked, but uh, fine. mostly me just locking myself in the bathroom and talking to the computer for a little bit. But, you know, I was disappointed at first when all the plans changed, because already set up this whole cross-country tour and everything. But you know, some of the one-on-one chats that done, I think, have gone maybe even a little better than if we were standing or sitting in front of an audience and kind of, you know, chasing after [chuckles] the audience reaction rather than just having a real, direct conversation. I know felt less self-conscious doing the Q&As on a computer as opposed to in front of an audience. brian In a lot of ways, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist is really your most personal and, I think safe to say, potentially embarrassing book. Is there an upside to doing having these conversations remotely? adrian Oh yeah. 100%. I mean, I was I prepared, but I was expecting some kind of mental breakdown that have while on the road, promoting this book, know, the real-life experiences actually surpass the embarrassment that I depict within the book it because good material that make it into the book, but also having to [laughs] endure it. And so, yeah. Definitely I had a lot were even like specific cities where I was like, I know so-and-so lives in that town you know. People that I was afraid I would run into along the way and specific questions that I knew I would have gotten from an audience Q&A but probably would not get from [laughs] a professional. brian curious, do you have specific examples of something that I probably ask you though, that a stranger in the audience might? adrian I was pretty sure that there would be questions about my digestive issues [laughs] issues that I want to go into onstage. And, you know, just in general I tried to make the book seem very casual and forthright and everything. Especially with regards to my family. It was very, very carefully calculated about how much I wanted to reveal and how much I felt like I could expose other people. And so, I wanna be in a situation where someone would say, like, what They refer to my kids and ask me about them or something like that. And just because my nature is just love talking about them and I would love to, you many much funnier anecdotes that make it into the book. And I think feel, in my need to get laughs [chuckles] onstage that I would expose them in a way probably better if I brian You know, I get the sense that every time you release a book, there is kind some nerves attached to it. [Adrian confirms.] You know. something that been working on for a really long time, finally putting out into the world and in each one of these case, all personal in different ways. How did the nerves surrounding the release of this book compare to previous books? adrian Part of the nerves of releasing a book is that tried to sort least with the last handful of try and challenge myself to do something a little different each time out, whether in terms of the drawing style or the subject matter or the tone or, you know, something as simple as color versus black and white. And so, you know, I think sort of an ease and a confidence that can come with just kind of doing the same thing with each book, maybe perfecting it a little bit each time. you know that not gonna be any real, unexpected response to it. I mean, either be positive or know. You know, more of the same or something like that. But it be, like, he really made a wrong turn this And so always the main thing on my mind, know, if lucky enough to get sort of a good response to something like my previous book, Killing and Dying . a part of me that just wants to get more of that [laughs] that same approbation. So, to do something different is always what weighs on me. Like, envision the negative reviews that say, like, he should have stuck with what he was good or something like that. And on top of that with this one, of course, the idea of doing something so explicitly autobiographical was a challenge. I mean, drawn myself as a character in the past, but in impersonal ways. know, it really makes no difference whether it was me or a fictional character, because the stories were so benign. So, when I started this one, I really kind of gave myself the challenge of, know. try and go into some uncomfortable areas, because no one wants to read 200 pages of just kind of light, uplifting anecdotes. At least I brian Do you get the sense that any or most of these stories could have worked as fictional stories? That they could have made it into one of your, like, guess for lack of a better books? adrian Yeeeah. Well, that was something that I thought about at first. And I think in a lot of ways, it would have been maybe more commercial, you know. Especially since now, it seems like every graphic novel is [chuckles] a springboard for a movie or TV project or something like that. I know. Like, sometimes the qualities that I look for, in art, are negatives to other people. Like, I want art that is as specific and personal as possible. But, you know, you look at what is kind of like the mainstream blockbuster hits and kind of the antithesis of that. But the thing I mean, aside from just not necessarily wanting to make that book, the thing that really impeded me was I started to think of, like, how much bizarre worldbuilding and fictionalization that it would require to translate this material. And so, like, to come up with, like, the young, Asian American frisbee player new on the scene and some more experienced frisbee players who, you know, take him under his wing All these things that just seem so stupid and then I started really thinking that the best way to present this material is to give the audience the knowledge that its absolutely true and it literally did happen to me. And I think that makes some of the things funnier or more impactful. brian How seriously are you considering things like commercial potential and how pragmatically, you know, when you sit down and work on a project going to take you five or seven years, say, how pragmatic are you being about that commercial potential? And has having a that impacted those concerns? adrian [Laughs.] not as pragmatic about it as I probably should be. And I think the main thing is that the process of creating a big comic, like a long work, least for so daunting and takes so much time and energy that no way I could get through a 200-page project if my heart 100% in it. Like, I think a lot of people have this illusion that selling out is the easiest path and for me it would actually be really difficult for me to sit down and think, like, what be the most adaptable kind of story and let me think of an actor and kind of create a character that that actor will instantly relate to and feel flattered by and wanna buy the rights to know. And then now let me spend 7 years [laughing] executing that I would be a real challenge and I think I would have the correct intuition to do it in a successful way. I mean, one of the strangest things that discovered in recent years is that the things that I maybe thought would be appealing in that way get zero interest. I then things that I assumed, you know, like this new book for example that I assumed would be completely uncommercial and was way too personal and, you know, that ends up getting the most attention. You know. the inquiries from Hollywood about this book have completely surprised me, in a way that I never, never could envisioned. brian So, you are having those conversations with producers about this book? adrian Yeah! I any conversation out of hand. I do [laughs] the exploratory work and, yeah. a bunch of projects related to various books of mine that are sort of up in the air, right now. Some less so. a movie that just finished production, in France. I think this week they actually finished shooting it. based on some of my stuff. brian So, does working in that that interest you? You know, obviously good friends with Dan Klaus. done a number of movies. actually done the screenwriting on a few of them as well, would you be interest in making that transition or at least exploring work outside of art and comics? adrian Very much so. In fact, at least right now, at this phase of my life and through, you know, much of from promoting the new been basically like a fulltime screenwriter. And been really enjoying it. know, it also makes me appreciate a lot about making comics, too. So, sure that get back to that soon. But it is nice to be doing something different and I know if just the fact that something different or if the work itself, but my wife is always commenting about how what a good mood I seem in at the end of a workday [laughs] , in contrast to the past whatever decade that had to endure me. brian Do you feel that having done comics for a few decades now, that that was good preparation for writing screenplays? adrian I know! I mean, I you know, live an alternate life where I have that experience and tried to write screenplays. You know, it seems like, yes. But for all I know, it might be a bit of a hindrance, too. I mean, a lot of the challenge for me is to not overwrite and not try and describe every single detail in the way that I would draw every single detail in a panel. And so, a lot of kind of trying to resist that impulse. And know. by nature a very collaborative process, which making comics, at least for me, is not at all. I mean, I basically work in isolation on a book and then give it to my publisher and if they like it, they publish it. But not a lot of editorial back and forth or checking in along the way or anything like that. very different! And I I think cartooning has given me certain skills that bringing to these new endeavors. But I think also maybe given me some bad habits in terms of how I expect to work, now. brian When it comes to doing strictly things in the comics medium, do you find that you abandon a lot of work along the way? adrian I afford to anymore! I used to. I could just kick myself when I think back on how much time and energy I wasted when I was younger. Like, I know, spend months writing a story and then draw half of it with, you know, Zipatone and corrections all this stuff and then decide that I like it and just put it aside. kind of a OCD thing, but like I would work on a page and, you know, after five days of working on it, make a little mistake and it would annoy me so much that instead of just cutting out the mistake or painting over it or something like that, I would start over. Which, now, just seems know, insanity. [Laughs.] And so, I think know, starting with Killing and Dying and then this new book, I feel like my work time is so limited. And [laughs] and then my life time is so limited that I feel like once I embark on a project, you know, I really gotta find a way to make it work. And I think sometimes interesting, I think. Sometimes maybe that struggle gives a little energy to the work that have come through something that just sailed through easily. brian I mean, not an old man but guess, given how long it takes to work on one of these books, does your mind immediately go to kind of quantifying how many of these you can potentially churn out? adrian Yeeeah. I think might friends and I have all turned that corner where gotten out a scrap of paper and done a few calculations about how many books we have left in us. One of the nice things about having cartoonist friends who are mostly older than me is that I can sort of see them go through all these things a few years ahead of me [laughs] and brace myself for it. But yeah, I know, I think definitely something that you are oblivious to when younger and think you have all the time in the world. Yeah. I mean, you know, there was a lot of other things going on in my life at the time, but the book before this Killing and Dying start to finish took about seven years. Which, you know, especially when you have kids that are growing up, you know, before your very eyes, the idea of like burying your nose in some project for seven years seems, you pretty unappealing to me right now. jesse We have a lot more with Adrian Tomine still to come.

[Music fades out.] jesse Hey all. Jesse again, with a reminder that end of the a great time to support your local NPR members station. Do it now. Go to . And thanks. music Bright, chiming music. jesse Welcome back to Bullseye , Jesse Thorn. Our guest is Adrian Tomine. Adrian is a cartoonist and the author of several comics collections and graphic novels. also illustrated covers for the New Yorker . His newest book is an illustrated memoir, called The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist . out now. being interviewed by our friend, Brian Heater: an editor at TechCrunch and host of the podcast Recommended if You Like . get back into it. brian Over the course of this book, which really starts when in grade school and you know, you do the thing where the teacher brings you up and asks you what you wanna do for a living and you say, you know, I wanna be think a cartoonist is the word you actually use at the time. adrian No, no. more embarrassing than that, I actually said that I wanted to be a famous cartoonist. [Laughs.] brian [Chuckling.] A famous cartoonist. Sure. You know. To the amusement guess the bemusement of your teacher and the amusement of the rest of the kids in class. But you know, something I think we really talk about a lot mean, something that, in a lot of ways, been single-mindedly focused on single-mindedly, but has occupied so much of your mind-share for such a long period of your life. So, that feels liberating for the first point in your life, to really not being thinking or actively engaging with comics? adrian Yes. I mean, I think that there was it by design at all, but I feel like there was an amazing confluence of factors that led me to kind of write that book that wrestled with some of these issues and wondered if I should really be spending so much of my time thinking and working on comics. And then that book came out the pandemic struck, and these screenwriting opportunities came up and it all just kind of flowed together, where it was almost like that book was sort of, you know, the start of a new phase in my life. And I plan that at all. I sort of thought, like, be the book where I kind of think about that And, you know, if people read the book and it to the very end, see that it kind of really resolve anything. And if anything, it sort of implies that gonna jump right back to work on another comic despite what arrived at, philosophically. But things work out that way and you I know something that I will return to. But right now, like, having sort of an imposed break from ways that I never could have consciously imposed upon myself. Like, I think it really took all these unbelievable external forces to truly change my life in the the way that it has. brian At this point in your career, is making it still a pleasurable experience? Are there pleasurable aspects of it? Or is it something that kind of, in a sense, been saddled with since you were a kid? adrian both! I mean, I would say that if I can get to the experience, the mindset, of making comics that I had when I was a other words, where you are creating purely for the joy of creating and not concerned about what at the expense of or what missing out on and the results are coming least to your well. And most importantly, when you have that feeling of time just sort of floating and you look up and you think been working for 15 minutes and, you know, 3 hours have passed or something like that. You replace that with anything. And so, when I have those experiences, it really outweighs any negative. But it is difficult to achieve that sometimes. Yeah. You know, just in general, I hard for me to say, this alternative work that doing right now that different. still sitting in the same room, just at a different desk know. It change that much, know. sure if the job that I was doing now was, you know, roofing or something like that, I would [laughs] really, really missing comics a lot. And I still feel that, to a degree. I always think that any time I have a really annoying meeting about movie or TV stuff, it pushes me one step closer back to making more [laughing] comics. brian Have you drawn anything? Have you drawn for yourself in the meantime? adrian Yeah. I mean, still maintaining what is left of my illustration career. And uh, I think I can say this, but throughout the quarantine I think had maybe three or covers for the New Yorker that were approved and accepted and completed and then at the last minute were made obsolete by the sudden change in the news or something like that. So, a lot of drawing that has not seen the light of day. brian But mean, not really a sketchbook guy, are you? Do you just kind guess kind of keep your skills up by drawing more casually for yourself? adrian tried to get back into it. You know. Like, definitely on the lazier side of that spectrum compared to some of my peers honestly understand it. Like, be working all day on a comic and then when eating dinner, doodling in their sketchbook or something like that. Or for fun, draw. And, yeah, am definitely not one of those people. while all been home and not being able to do as much. I have been doing more, you know, sketchbook kind of pleasure drawing. And you know, one of the things that I have been doing is like, because been watching more TV than usual and feeling guilty about it, been trying to draw while watching TV. And so, I was, for a while, on Instagram I was posting sketches that I was doing of people [chuckling] that I I was watching on TV. brian this specific to obviously to some degree, anytime working in fiction, going to be a certain amount of autobiography, a certain amount of truth, and that does absolutely hold for a lot of the work that done in the past. You know. Given the sensitivity of certain topics, even though you are perhaps x-ing out some names, do you feel that there are things that you can reveal or that there are truths that you are able to get to in fiction that you in memoir? adrian Oh, 100%. a very inhibited person. I mean, as much as people talk about like, believe you showed yourself sitting on the or something like that, that mean, really, in the scope of like human shame [laughs] pretty minor. And yeah, was a real struggle and I think that for sure there are lots of topics and experiences that, for me, are better funneled through fiction. And in mean, I think necessarily something that I wanna do right on the heels of this book, but I have had ideas for a fictional book about an author on the road and I think that that would be a place for me to put in a lot of the things that I feel comfortable making autobiographical. brian So, before we go, I do have to ask is one story in this book that is relevant to this current situation right now. The Fresh Air interview that you did. [Adrian agrees with a laugh.] Which obviously go exactly as you had hoped and clearly there were a lot of external adrian Well, I mean first of all, I gotta preempt this, because happened is since the book has come out, people have gone to the website and have found that episode and they say, so full of it. trying to, like, create drama that there and trying to, like, be falsely modest or something. the interview as And my defense is that that is purely a testament to the skill and kindness of the editors Fresh Air , who like surgeons, worked magic on the raw material. There are so many incidents and moments from that interview that I remember [laugh] with crystal clear clarity that have been artfully omitted or finessed. So, wanted to clarify that, because people have held that up as empirical proof that this whole book is [censored] or something. brian Sure. And I wanna go on record as, you know, somebody followed you for a while and had a number of conversations over the years that I [laugh] I believe that you accurately portrayed the information. [Adrian laughs and agrees.] You know. But I have to ask, you know, having done this for a while, do you feel that you have become a better interviewee? That become more comfortable with being on that side of the mic and being, I guess, kind of probed to some degree? adrian I wonder that what that what take on it is? Having talked to me over the years? [Laughs.] Numbers help? brian [Laughs.] I think so! I think fair. Yeah. No, I think know. I think kind of more comfortable and have opened up quite a bit. adrian Yeah. I mean, you know, the best way for me to learn and improve at anything is by failing. You know. Especially with this totally bizarre aspect of the job that literally did not exist before my generation of cartoonists. But this idea of having to promote yourself and to be a public figure in some minor capacity know, just the fact that cartoonists now have to even give a thought to how they look, about what their hair looks like or what wearing or anything like that is horrible! I think a terrible betrayal of what this job looked like when I started out. But you know, no training for it. You know? Like, you actually colleges now where you can go learn to be a cartoonist and they teach you how to ink and how to use a tablet and all these things. But no training for this side of the job. And I imagine, if you were in any industry where there was a higher amount of money involved, you would have people took you to a stylist and who taught you media training and in advance told you, like, who this interviewer is, and this is what to expect. And none of that in my world. And know. So many experiences like the one that talking about where I just sort of like am looking at an address that was given to me and I kind of wander into some building and then [laughs] suddenly in the middle of this situation that I expecting. And so, my training has been on the job, unfortunately. And so, you know. If a little bit more comfortable doing it now, because I was horrible on Fresh Air . brian Well, Adrian, you did great today.

Maybe you read his series Optic Nerve or know his books, like Killing and Dying and Shortcoming . reminiscent of Daniel Klaus or Jaime Hernandez, maybe Harvey Pekar: dark, realistic, but with an edge of humor as well. And even if you a fan of comics, probably seen work. done several covers for the New Yorker , including a couple recently that illustrate the absurdity, frustration and isolation many people are experiencing after being home so long. Messy apartments, dates over video chat, Daniel Tiger episodes playing on repeat as kids climb up the walls. got a new book out now. called The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist . And in it, he takes a little bit of a different approach. For one, the presentation. The book looks like a notebook, each page written on graph paper. also autobiographical. Tomine recounts book tours, trips to the doctor, even an interview he did on Fresh Air . Conducting our interview with Adrian is Brian Heater. Brian is an editor for TechCrunch and the host of the podcast Recommended if You Like . interviewed Adrian many times before and has seen him go from a small-print indie comics artist to, these days, a real big-deal comics artist and a screenwriter. [Music fades in.] So. get into it. Brian Heater and Adrian Tomine. music Light, airy music. brian heater Adrian Tomine, thank you so much for joining us on Bullseye . adrian tomine Hi Brian. How you doing? brian I am doing well, all things considered. How is the book tour going for you so far? adrian [Laughs.] The book tour, I even know exactly book tour you were referring to [laughs] when you asked, but uh, fine. mostly me just locking myself in the bathroom and talking to the computer for a little bit. But, you know, I was disappointed at first when all the plans changed, because already set up this whole cross-country tour and everything. But you know, some of the one-on-one chats that done, I think, have gone maybe even a little better than if we were standing or sitting in front of an audience and kind of, you know, chasing after [chuckles] the audience reaction rather than just having a real, direct conversation. I know felt less self-conscious doing the Q&As on a computer as opposed to in front of an audience. brian In a lot of ways, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist is really your most personal and, I think safe to say, potentially embarrassing book. Is there an upside to doing having these conversations remotely? adrian Oh yeah. 100%. I mean, I was I prepared, but I was expecting some kind of mental breakdown that have while on the road, promoting this book, know, the real-life experiences actually surpass the embarrassment that I depict within the book it because good material that make it into the book, but also having to [laughs] endure it. And so, yeah. Definitely I had a lot were even like specific cities where I was like, I know so-and-so lives in that town you know. People that I was afraid I would run into along the way and specific questions that I knew I would have gotten from an audience Q&A but probably would not get from [laughs] a professional. brian curious, do you have specific examples of something that I probably ask you though, that a stranger in the audience might? adrian I was pretty sure that there would be questions about my digestive issues [laughs] issues that I want to go into onstage. And, you know, just in general I tried to make the book seem very casual and forthright and everything. Especially with regards to my family. It was very, very carefully calculated about how much I wanted to reveal and how much I felt like I could expose other people. And so, I wanna be in a situation where someone would say, like, what They refer to my kids and ask me about them or something like that. And just because my nature is just love talking about them and I would love to, you many much funnier anecdotes that make it into the book. And I think feel, in my need to get laughs [chuckles] onstage that I would expose them in a way probably better if I brian You know, I get the sense that every time you release a book, there is kind some nerves attached to it. [Adrian confirms.] You know. something that been working on for a really long time, finally putting out into the world and in each one of these case, all personal in different ways. How did the nerves surrounding the release of this book compare to previous books? adrian Part of the nerves of releasing a book is that tried to sort least with the last handful of try and challenge myself to do something a little different each time out, whether in terms of the drawing style or the subject matter or the tone or, you know, something as simple as color versus black and white. And so, you know, I think sort of an ease and a confidence that can come with just kind of doing the same thing with each book, maybe perfecting it a little bit each time. you know that not gonna be any real, unexpected response to it. I mean, either be positive or know. You know, more of the same or something like that. But it be, like, he really made a wrong turn this And so always the main thing on my mind, know, if lucky enough to get sort of a good response to something like my previous book, Killing and Dying . a part of me that just wants to get more of that [laughs] that same approbation. So, to do something different is always what weighs on me. Like, envision the negative reviews that say, like, he should have stuck with what he was good or something like that. And on top of that with this one, of course, the idea of doing something so explicitly autobiographical was a challenge. I mean, drawn myself as a character in the past, but in impersonal ways. know, it really makes no difference whether it was me or a fictional character, because the stories were so benign. So, when I started this one, I really kind of gave myself the challenge of, know. try and go into some uncomfortable areas, because no one wants to read 200 pages of just kind of light, uplifting anecdotes. At least I brian Do you get the sense that any or most of these stories could have worked as fictional stories? That they could have made it into one of your, like, guess for lack of a better books? adrian Yeeeah. Well, that was something that I thought about at first. And I think in a lot of ways, it would have been maybe more commercial, you know. Especially since now, it seems like every graphic novel is [chuckles] a springboard for a movie or TV project or something like that. I know. Like, sometimes the qualities that I look for, in art, are negatives to other people. Like, I want art that is as specific and personal as possible. But, you know, you look at what is kind of like the mainstream blockbuster hits and kind of the antithesis of that. But the thing I mean, aside from just not necessarily wanting to make that book, the thing that really impeded me was I started to think of, like, how much bizarre worldbuilding and fictionalization that it would require to translate this material. And so, like, to come up with, like, the young, Asian American frisbee player new on the scene and some more experienced frisbee players who, you know, take him under his wing All these things that just seem so stupid and then I started really thinking that the best way to present this material is to give the audience the knowledge that its absolutely true and it literally did happen to me. And I think that makes some of the things funnier or more impactful. brian How seriously are you considering things like commercial potential and how pragmatically, you know, when you sit down and work on a project going to take you five or seven years, say, how pragmatic are you being about that commercial potential? And has having a that impacted those concerns? adrian [Laughs.] not as pragmatic about it as I probably should be. And I think the main thing is that the process of creating a big comic, like a long work, least for so daunting and takes so much time and energy that no way I could get through a 200-page project if my heart 100% in it. Like, I think a lot of people have this illusion that selling out is the easiest path and for me it would actually be really difficult for me to sit down and think, like, what be the most adaptable kind of story and let me think of an actor and kind of create a character that that actor will instantly relate to and feel flattered by and wanna buy the rights to know. And then now let me spend 7 years [laughing] executing that I would be a real challenge and I think I would have the correct intuition to do it in a successful way. I mean, one of the strangest things that discovered in recent years is that the things that I maybe thought would be appealing in that way get zero interest. I then things that I assumed, you know, like this new book for example that I assumed would be completely uncommercial and was way too personal and, you know, that ends up getting the most attention. You know. the inquiries from Hollywood about this book have completely surprised me, in a way that I never, never could envisioned. brian So, you are having those conversations with producers about this book? adrian Yeah! I any conversation out of hand. I do [laughs] the exploratory work and, yeah. a bunch of projects related to various books of mine that are sort of up in the air, right now. Some less so. a movie that just finished production, in France. I think this week they actually finished shooting it. based on some of my stuff. brian So, does working in that that interest you? You know, obviously good friends with Dan Klaus. done a number of movies. actually done the screenwriting on a few of them as well, would you be interest in making that transition or at least exploring work outside of art and comics? adrian Very much so. In fact, at least right now, at this phase of my life and through, you know, much of from promoting the new been basically like a fulltime screenwriter. And been really enjoying it. know, it also makes me appreciate a lot about making comics, too. So, sure that get back to that soon. But it is nice to be doing something different and I know if just the fact that something different or if the work itself, but my wife is always commenting about how what a good mood I seem in at the end of a workday [laughs] , in contrast to the past whatever decade that had to endure me. brian Do you feel that having done comics for a few decades now, that that was good preparation for writing screenplays? adrian I know! I mean, I you know, live an alternate life where I have that experience and tried to write screenplays. You know, it seems like, yes. But for all I know, it might be a bit of a hindrance, too. I mean, a lot of the challenge for me is to not overwrite and not try and describe every single detail in the way that I would draw every single detail in a panel. And so, a lot of kind of trying to resist that impulse. And know. by nature a very collaborative process, which making comics, at least for me, is not at all. I mean, I basically work in isolation on a book and then give it to my publisher and if they like it, they publish it. But not a lot of editorial back and forth or checking in along the way or anything like that. very different! And I I think cartooning has given me certain skills that bringing to these new endeavors. But I think also maybe given me some bad habits in terms of how I expect to work, now. brian When it comes to doing strictly things in the comics medium, do you find that you abandon a lot of work along the way? adrian I afford to anymore! I used to. I could just kick myself when I think back on how much time and energy I wasted when I was younger. Like, I know, spend months writing a story and then draw half of it with, you know, Zipatone and corrections all this stuff and then decide that I like it and just put it aside. kind of a OCD thing, but like I would work on a page and, you know, after five days of working on it, make a little mistake and it would annoy me so much that instead of just cutting out the mistake or painting over it or something like that, I would start over. Which, now, just seems know, insanity. [Laughs.] And so, I think know, starting with Killing and Dying and then this new book, I feel like my work time is so limited. And [laughs] and then my life time is so limited that I feel like once I embark on a project, you know, I really gotta find a way to make it work. And I think sometimes interesting, I think. Sometimes maybe that struggle gives a little energy to the work that have come through something that just sailed through easily. brian I mean, not an old man but guess, given how long it takes to work on one of these books, does your mind immediately go to kind of quantifying how many of these you can potentially churn out? adrian Yeeeah. I think might friends and I have all turned that corner where gotten out a scrap of paper and done a few calculations about how many books we have left in us. One of the nice things about having cartoonist friends who are mostly older than me is that I can sort of see them go through all these things a few years ahead of me [laughs] and brace myself for it. But yeah, I know, I think definitely something that you are oblivious to when younger and think you have all the time in the world. Yeah. I mean, you know, there was a lot of other things going on in my life at the time, but the book before this Killing and Dying start to finish took about seven years. Which, you know, especially when you have kids that are growing up, you know, before your very eyes, the idea of like burying your nose in some project for seven years seems, you pretty unappealing to me right now. jesse We have a lot more with Adrian Tomine still to come.

You replace that with anything. And so, when I have those experiences, it really outweighs any negative. But it is difficult to achieve that sometimes. Yeah. You know, just in general, I hard for me to say, this alternative work that doing right now that different. still sitting in the same room, just at a different desk know. It change that much, know. sure if the job that I was doing now was, you know, roofing or something like that, I would [laughs] really, really missing comics a lot. And I still feel that, to a degree. I always think that any time I have a really annoying meeting about movie or TV stuff, it pushes me one step closer back to making more [laughing] comics. brian Have you drawn anything? Have you drawn for yourself in the meantime? adrian Yeah. I mean, still maintaining what is left of my illustration career. And uh, I think I can say this, but throughout the quarantine I think had maybe three or covers for the New Yorker that were approved and accepted and completed and then at the last minute were made obsolete by the sudden change in the news or something like that. So, a lot of drawing that has not seen the light of day. brian But mean, not really a sketchbook guy, are you? Do you just kind guess kind of keep your skills up by drawing more casually for yourself? adrian tried to get back into it. You know. Like, definitely on the lazier side of that spectrum compared to some of my peers honestly understand it. Like, be working all day on a comic and then when eating dinner, doodling in their sketchbook or something like that. Or for fun, draw. And, yeah, am definitely not one of those people. while all been home and not being able to do as much. I have been doing more, you know, sketchbook kind of pleasure drawing. And you know, one of the things that I have been doing is like, because been watching more TV than usual and feeling guilty about it, been trying to draw while watching TV. And so, I was, for a while, on Instagram I was posting sketches that I was doing of people [chuckling] that I I was watching on TV. brian this specific to obviously to some degree, anytime working in fiction, going to be a certain amount of autobiography, a certain amount of truth, and that does absolutely hold for a lot of the work that done in the past. You know. Given the sensitivity of certain topics, even though you are perhaps x-ing out some names, do you feel that there are things that you can reveal or that there are truths that you are able to get to in fiction that you in memoir? adrian Oh, 100%. a very inhibited person. I mean, as much as people talk about like, believe you showed yourself sitting on the or something like that, that mean, really, in the scope of like human shame [laughs] pretty minor. And yeah, was a real struggle and I think that for sure there are lots of topics and experiences that, for me, are better funneled through fiction. And in mean, I think necessarily something that I wanna do right on the heels of this book, but I have had ideas for a fictional book about an author on the road and I think that that would be a place for me to put in a lot of the things that I feel comfortable making autobiographical. brian So, before we go, I do have to ask is one story in this book that is relevant to this current situation right now. The Fresh Air interview that you did. [Adrian agrees with a laugh.] Which obviously go exactly as you had hoped and clearly there were a lot of external adrian Well, I mean first of all, I gotta preempt this, because happened is since the book has come out, people have gone to the website and have found that episode and they say, so full of it. trying to, like, create drama that there and trying to, like, be falsely modest or something. the interview as And my defense is that that is purely a testament to the skill and kindness of the editors Fresh Air , who like surgeons, worked magic on the raw material. There are so many incidents and moments from that interview that I remember [laugh] with crystal clear clarity that have been artfully omitted or finessed. So, wanted to clarify that, because people have held that up as empirical proof that this whole book is [censored] or something. brian Sure. And I wanna go on record as, you know, somebody followed you for a while and had a number of conversations over the years that I [laugh] I believe that you accurately portrayed the information. [Adrian laughs and agrees.] You know. But I have to ask, you know, having done this for a while, do you feel that you have become a better interviewee? That become more comfortable with being on that side of the mic and being, I guess, kind of probed to some degree? adrian I wonder that what that what take on it is? Having talked to me over the years? [Laughs.] Numbers help? brian [Laughs.] I think so! I think fair. Yeah. No, I think know. I think kind of more comfortable and have opened up quite a bit. adrian Yeah. I mean, you know, the best way for me to learn and improve at anything is by failing. You know. Especially with this totally bizarre aspect of the job that literally did not exist before my generation of cartoonists. But this idea of having to promote yourself and to be a public figure in some minor capacity know, just the fact that cartoonists now have to even give a thought to how they look, about what their hair looks like or what wearing or anything like that is horrible! I think a terrible betrayal of what this job looked like when I started out. But you know, no training for it. You know? Like, you actually colleges now where you can go learn to be a cartoonist and they teach you how to ink and how to use a tablet and all these things. But no training for this side of the job. And I imagine, if you were in any industry where there was a higher amount of money involved, you would have people took you to a stylist and who taught you media training and in advance told you, like, who this interviewer is, and this is what to expect. And none of that in my world. And know. So many experiences like the one that talking about where I just sort of like am looking at an address that was given to me and I kind of wander into some building and then [laughs] suddenly in the middle of this situation that I expecting. And so, my training has been on the job, unfortunately. And so, you know. If a little bit more comfortable doing it now, because I was horrible on Fresh Air . brian Well, Adrian, you did great today.

'brian curious, do you have specific examples of something that I probably ask you though, that a stranger in the audience might?', 'adrian I was pretty sure that there would be questions about my digestive issues [laughs] issues that I want to go into onstage.', 'And, you know, just in general I tried to make the book seem very casual and forthright and everything.', 'Especially with regards to my family.', 'It was very, very carefully calculated about how much I wanted to reveal and how much I felt like I could expose other people.', 'And so, I wanna be in a situation where someone would say, like, what They refer to my kids and ask me about them or something like that.', 'And just because my nature is just love talking about them and I would love to, you many much funnier anecdotes that make it into the book.', 'And I think feel, in my need to get laughs [chuckles] onstage that I would expose them in a way probably better if I brian You know, I get the sense that every time you release a book, there is kind some nerves attached to it.', '[Adrian confirms.]', 'You know.', 'something that been working on for a really long time, finally putting out into the world and in each one of these case, all personal in different ways.', 'How did the nerves surrounding the release of this book compare to previous books?', 'adrian Part of the nerves of releasing a book is that tried to sort least with the last handful of try and challenge myself to do something a little different each time out, whether in terms of the drawing style or the subject matter or the tone or, you know, something as simple as color versus black and white.', 'And so, you know, I think sort of an ease and a confidence that can come with just kind of doing the same thing with each book, maybe perfecting it a little bit each time.', 'you know that not gonna be any real, unexpected response to it.', 'I mean, either be positive or know.', 'You know, more of the same or something like that.', 'But it be, like, he really made a wrong turn this And so always the main thing on my mind, know, if lucky enough to get sort of a good response to something like my previous book, Killing and Dying .', 'a part of me that just wants to get more of that [laughs] that same approbation.', 'So, to do something different is always what weighs on me.', 'Like, envision the negative reviews that say, like, he should have stuck with what he was good or something like that.', 'And on top of that with this one, of course, the idea of doing something so explicitly autobiographical was a challenge.', 'I mean, drawn myself as a character in the past, but in impersonal ways.', 'know, it really makes no difference whether it was me or a fictional character, because the stories were so benign.', 'So, when I started this one, I really kind of gave myself the challenge of, know.', 'try and go into some uncomfortable areas, because no one wants to read 200 pages of just kind of light, uplifting anecdotes.', 'At least I brian Do you get the sense that any or most of these stories could have worked as fictional stories?', 'That they could have made it into one of your, like, guess for lack of a better books?', 'adrian Yeeeah.', 'Well, that was something that I thought about at first.', 'And I think in a lot of ways, it would have been maybe more commercial, you know.', 'Especially since now, it seems like every graphic novel is [chuckles] a springboard for a movie or TV project or something like that.', 'I know.', 'Like, sometimes the qualities that I look for, in art, are negatives to other people.', 'Like, I want art that is as specific and personal as possible.', 'But, you know, you look at what is kind of like the mainstream blockbuster hits and kind of the antithesis of that.', 'But the thing I mean, aside from just not necessarily wanting to make that book, the thing that really impeded me was I started to think of, like, how much bizarre worldbuilding and fictionalization that it would require to translate this material.', 'And so, like, to come up with, like, the young, Asian American frisbee player new on the scene and some more experienced frisbee players who, you know, take him under his wing All these things that just seem so stupid and then I started really thinking that the best way to present this material is to give the audience the knowledge that its absolutely true and it literally did happen to me.', 'And I think that makes some of the things funnier or more impactful.', 'brian How seriously are you considering things like commercial potential and how pragmatically, you know, when you sit down and work on a project going to take you five or seven years, say, how pragmatic are you being about that commercial potential?', 'And has having a that impacted those concerns?', 'adrian [Laughs.]', 'not as pragmatic about it as I probably should be.', 'And I think the main thing is that the process of creating a big comic, like a long work, least for so daunting and takes so much time and energy that no way I could get through a 200-page project if my heart 100% in it.', 'Like, I think a lot of people have this illusion that selling out is the easiest path and for me it would actually be really difficult for me to sit down and think, like, what be the most adaptable kind of story and let me think of an actor and kind of create a character that that actor will instantly relate to and feel flattered by and wanna buy the rights to know.', 'And then now let me spend 7 years [laughing] executing that I would be a real challenge and I think I would have the correct intuition to do it in a successful way.', 'I mean, one of the strangest things that discovered in recent years is that the things that I maybe thought would be appealing in that way get zero interest.', 'I then things that I assumed, you know, like this new book for example that I assumed would be completely uncommercial and was way too personal and, you know, that ends up getting the most attention.', 'You know.', 'the inquiries from Hollywood about this book have completely surprised me, in a way that I never, never could envisioned.', 'brian So, you are having those conversations with producers about this book?', 'adrian Yeah!', 'I any conversation out of hand.', 'I do [laughs] the exploratory work and, yeah.', 'a bunch of projects related to various books of mine that are sort of up in the air, right now.', 'Some less so.', 'a movie that just finished production, in France.', 'I think this week they actually finished shooting it.', 'based on some of my stuff.', 'brian So, does working in that that interest you?', 'You know, obviously good friends with Dan Klaus.', 'done a number of movies.', 'actually done the screenwriting on a few of them as well, would you be interest in making that transition or at least exploring work outside of art and comics?', 'adrian Very much so.', 'In fact, at least right now, at this phase of my life and through, you know, much of from promoting the new been basically like a fulltime screenwriter.', 'And been really enjoying it.', 'know, it also makes me appreciate a lot about making comics, too.', 'So, sure that get back to that soon.', 'But it is nice to be doing something different and I know if just the fact that something different or if the work itself, but my wife is always commenting about how what a good mood I seem in at the end of a workday [laughs] , in contrast to the past whatever decade that had to endure me.', 'brian Do you feel that having done comics for a few decades now, that that was good preparation for writing screenplays?', 'adrian I know!', 'I mean, I you know, live an alternate life where I have that experience and tried to write screenplays.', 'You know, it seems like, yes.', 'But for all I know, it might be a bit of a hindrance, too.', 'I mean, a lot of the challenge for me is to not overwrite and not try and describe every single detail in the way that I would draw every single detail in a panel.', 'And so, a lot of kind of trying to resist that impulse.', 'And know.', 'by nature a very collaborative process, which making comics, at least for me, is not at all.', 'I mean, I basically work in isolation on a book and then give it to my publisher and if they like it, they publish it.', 'But not a lot of editorial back and forth or checking in along the way or anything like that.', 'very different!', 'And I I think cartooning has given me certain skills that bringing to these new endeavors.', 'But I think also maybe given me some bad habits in terms of how I expect to work, now.', 'brian When it comes to doing strictly things in the comics medium, do you find that you abandon a lot of work along the way?', 'adrian I afford to anymore!', 'I used to.', 'I could just kick myself when I think back on how much time and energy I wasted when I was younger.', 'Like, I know, spend months writing a story and then draw half of it with, you know, Zipatone and corrections all this stuff and then decide that I like it and just put it aside.', 'kind of a OCD thing, but like I would work on a page and, you know, after five days of working on it, make a little mistake and it would annoy me so much that instead of just cutting out the mistake or painting over it or something like that, I would start over.', 'Which, now, just seems know, insanity.', '[Laughs.]', 'And so, I think know, starting with Killing and Dying and then this new book, I feel like my work time is so limited.', 'And [laughs] and then my life time is so limited that I feel like once I embark on a project, you know, I really gotta find a way to make it work.', 'And I think sometimes interesting, I think.', 'Sometimes maybe that struggle gives a little energy to the work that have come through something that just sailed through easily.', 'brian I mean, not an old man but guess, given how long it takes to work on one of these books, does your mind immediately go to kind of quantifying how many of these you can potentially churn out?', 'adrian Yeeeah.', 'I think might friends and I have all turned that corner where gotten out a scrap of paper and done a few calculations about how many books we have left in us.', 'One of the nice things about having cartoonist friends who are mostly older than me is that I can sort of see them go through all these things a few years ahead of me [laughs] and brace myself for it.', 'But yeah, I know, I think definitely something that you are oblivious to when younger and think you have all the time in the world.', 'Yeah.', 'I mean, you know, there was a lot of other things going on in my life at the time, but the book before this Killing and Dying start to finish took about seven years.', 'Which, you know, especially when you have kids that are growing up, you know, before your very eyes, the idea of like burying your nose in some project for seven years seems, you pretty unappealing to me right now.',

and asks you what you wanna do for a living and you say, you know, I wanna be think a cartoonist is the word you actually use at the time.', 'adrian No, no.', 'more embarrassing than that, I actually said that I wanted to be a famous cartoonist.', '[Laughs.]', 'brian [Chuckling.]', 'A famous cartoonist.', 'Sure.', 'You know.', 'To the amusement guess the bemusement of your teacher and the amusement of the rest of the kids in class.', 'But you know, something I think we really talk about a lot mean, something that, in a lot of ways, been single-mindedly focused on single-mindedly, but has occupied so much of your mind-share for such a long period of your life.', 'So, that feels liberating for the first point in your life, to really not being thinking or actively engaging with comics?', 'adrian Yes.', 'I mean, I think that there was it by design at all, but I feel like there was an amazing confluence of factors that led me to kind of write that book that wrestled with some of these issues and wondered if I should really be spending so much of my time thinking and working on comics.', 'And then that book came out the pandemic struck, and these screenwriting opportunities came up and it all just kind of flowed together, where it was almost like that book was sort of, you know, the start of a new phase in my life.', 'And I plan that at all.', 'I sort of thought, like, be the book where I kind of think about that And, you know, if people read the book and it to the very end, see that it kind of really resolve anything.', 'And if anything, it sort of implies that gonna jump right back to work on another comic despite what arrived at, philosophically.', 'But things work out that way and you I know something that I will return to.', 'But right now, like, having sort of an imposed break from ways that I never could have consciously imposed upon myself.', 'Like, I think it really took all these unbelievable external forces to truly change my life in the the way that it has.', 'brian At this point in your career, is making it still a pleasurable experience?', 'Are there pleasurable aspects of it?', 'Or is it something that kind of, in a sense, been saddled with since you were a kid?', 'adrian both!', 'I mean, I would say that if I can get to the experience, the mindset, of making comics that I had when I was a other words, where you are creating purely for the joy of creating and not concerned about what at the expense of or what missing out on and the results are coming least to your well.', 'And most importantly, when you have that feeling of time just sort of floating and you look up and you think been working for 15 minutes and, you know, 3 hours have passed or something like that.', 'You replace that with anything.', 'And so, when I have those experiences, it really outweighs any negative.', 'But it is difficult to achieve that sometimes.', 'Yeah.', 'You know, just in general, I hard for me to say, this alternative work that doing right now that different.', 'still sitting in the same room, just at a different desk know.', 'It change that much, know.', 'sure if the job that I was doing now was, you know, roofing or something like that, I would [laughs] really, really missing comics a lot.', 'And I still feel that, to a degree.', 'I always think that any time I have a really annoying meeting about movie or TV stuff, it pushes me one step closer back to making more [laughing] comics.', 'brian Have you drawn anything?', 'Have you drawn for yourself in the meantime?', 'adrian Yeah.', 'I mean, still maintaining what is left of my illustration career.', 'And uh, I think I can say this, but throughout the quarantine I think had maybe three or covers for the New Yorker that were approved and accepted and completed and then at the last minute were made obsolete by the sudden change in the news or something like that.', 'So, a lot of drawing that has not seen the light of day.', 'brian But mean, not really a sketchbook guy, are you?', 'Do you just kind guess kind of keep your skills up by drawing more casually for yourself?', 'adrian tried to get back into it.', 'You know.', 'Like, definitely on the lazier side of that spectrum compared to some of my peers honestly understand it.', 'Like, be working all day on a comic and then when eating dinner, doodling in their sketchbook or something like that.', 'Or for fun, draw.', 'And, yeah, am definitely not one of those people.', 'while all been home and not being able to do as much.', 'I have been doing more, you know, sketchbook kind of pleasure drawing.', 'And you know, one of the things that I have been doing is like, because been watching more TV than usual and feeling guilty about it, been trying to draw while watching TV.', 'And so, I was, for a while, on Instagram I was posting sketches that I was doing of people [chuckling] that I I was watching on TV.', 'brian this specific to obviously to some degree, anytime working in fiction, going to be a certain amount of autobiography, a certain amount of truth, and that does absolutely hold for a lot of the work that done in the past.', 'You know.', 'Given the sensitivity of certain topics, even though you are perhaps x-ing out some names, do you feel that there are things that you can reveal or that there are truths that you are able to get to in fiction that you in memoir?', 'adrian Oh, 100%.', 'a very inhibited person.', 'I mean, as much as people talk about like, believe you showed yourself sitting on the or something like that, that mean, really, in the scope of like human shame [laughs] pretty minor.', 'And yeah, was a real struggle and I think that for sure there are lots of topics and experiences that, for me, are better funneled through fiction.', 'And in mean, I think necessarily something that I wanna do right on the heels of this book, but I have had ideas for a fictional book about an author on the road and I think that that would be a place for me to put in a lot of the things that I feel comfortable making autobiographical.', 'brian So, before we go, I do have to ask is one story in this book that is relevant to this current situation right now.', 'The Fresh Air interview that you did.', '[Adrian agrees with a laugh.]', 'Which obviously go exactly as you had hoped and clearly there were a lot of external adrian Well, I mean first of all, I gotta preempt this, because happened is since the book has come out, people have gone to the website and have found that episode and they say, so full of it.', 'trying to, like, create drama that there and trying to, like, be falsely modest or something.', 'the interview as And my defense is that that is purely a testament to the skill and kindness of the editors Fresh Air , who like surgeons, worked magic on the raw material.', 'There are so many incidents and moments from that interview that I remember [laugh] with crystal clear clarity that have been artfully omitted or finessed.', 'So, wanted to clarify that, because people have held that up as empirical proof that this whole book is [censored] or something.', 'brian Sure.', 'And I wanna go on record as, you know, somebody followed you for a while and had a number of conversations over the years that I [laugh] I believe that you accurately portrayed the information.', '[Adrian laughs and agrees.]', 'You know.', 'But I have to ask, you know, having done this for a while, do you feel that you have become a better interviewee?', 'That become more comfortable with being on that side of the mic and being, I guess, kind of probed to some degree?', 'adrian I wonder that what that what take on it is?', 'Having talked to me over the years?', '[Laughs.]', 'Numbers help?', 'brian [Laughs.]', 'I think so!', 'I think fair.', 'Yeah.', 'No, I think know.', 'I think kind of more comfortable and have opened up quite a bit.', 'adrian Yeah.', 'I mean, you know, the best way for me to learn and improve at anything is by failing.', 'You know.', 'Especially with this totally bizarre aspect of the job that literally did not exist before my generation of cartoonists.', 'But this idea of having to promote yourself and to be a public figure in some minor capacity know, just the fact that cartoonists now have to even give a thought to how they look, about what their hair looks like or what wearing or anything like that is horrible!', 'I think a terrible betrayal of what this job looked like when I started out.', 'But you know, no training for it.', 'You know?', 'Like, you actually colleges now where you can go learn to be a cartoonist and they teach you how to ink and how to use a tablet and all these things.', 'But no training for this side of the job.', 'And I imagine, if you were in any industry where there was a higher amount of money involved, you would have people took you to a stylist and who taught you media training and in advance told you, like, who this interviewer is, and this is what to expect.', 'And none of that in my world.', 'And know.', 'So many experiences like the one that talking about where I just sort of like am looking at an address that was given to me and I kind of wander into some building and then [laughs] suddenly in the middle of this situation that I expecting.', 'And so, my training has been on the job, unfortunately.', 'And so, you know.', 'If a
