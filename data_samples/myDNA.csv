I'm Katy Bowman, biomechanist and author of "", ' and a bunch of other books about movement. \xa0This show is about how movement works on the cellular level, how to change your position as you move and why you might want to, and how movement works in the world; also known as Movement Ecology. All bodies are welcome. \xa0Are you ready to get moving?', 'Music', ""KATY: Hello friends. This is the 10th episode in this short series of interviews I'm doing on movement; specifically the many ways movement - specifically the many ways people consider movement outside of exercise. I’d like to do a small shout out to \xa0Dr. Ihi Heke, who I interviewed in "", "", whose sharing of his indigenous perspective on movement and health has been our most popular episode according to iTunes. So, Yay! You and hear it in my voice, it's hoarse, from just saying “yay” and expressing gratitude to everyone who shared. Especially my New Zealand listeners. I really appreciated you getting the word out about Dr. Heke's work. He is such an important voice in this movement movement. \xa0We're starting to tune into to other cultural perspectives which is why I am excited to talk to Philip Brass today. He's a member of the Peepeekisis First Nation on the Treaty Four Territory of Canada, for another indigenous perspective on natural movement. "", 'But before we get there, I’ve got some questions on natural movement to answer. These are brought to you by our Dynamic Collective, which is a co-op of sponsors that includes: ', ', ', ', ', ' and ', ' - all companies that support some lifestyle element of natural movement, from minimal footwear; sandals, boots, running footwear, something to wear with your nice clothes. Something that you can feel comfortable taking camping and backpacking - \xa0for all ages and all seasons - to minimal furniture that includes sitting cushions and balls that allow more of you to move while you’re just sitting there. These companies sponsor this question and answer portion of each episode of Move Your DNA. And you can find more about them in our show notes.', 'So anyway,', ' and there was a lot of discussion in the Instagram post, so I\'ll like to that post in my show notes. But there was this great question from Kate. And her comment was: \xa0""No way!!"" I\'m assuming she said it like that because she put a bunch of exclamation points. ""No Way!"" That\'s how Canadians talk. ""I take my kids to the pool every week during the cold months and I always think “Katy wouldn’t count this as movement” because it isn’t weight bearing. Am I wrong?!? I’m so happy to hear otherwise!"" \xa0So you can see exactly what I wrote back to her but for those of you who listen to this podcast, I\'m already here for the answer. It\'s like of course, of course swimming is a natural movement and I find it to be a critical natural movement skill given the fact that many of us will encounter bodies of water in our life and not only because it\'s fun but because it can be life-saving natural movement knowledge. Right? \xa0If we change the word skill to knowledge and say I have the knowledge of how to move through the water then it\'s very important. Is it weight bearing? No. Does all movement have to be weight bearing? No. So I guess as I explained to her: natural movement is a collection of many many movements so I would absolutely consider swimming to be a vitamin. It\'s just that, right now, in a sedentary culture where we are picking and choosing maybe the one or two vitamins that we are going to consume, it isn\'t weight bearing and so due to the laws of specificity and that we adapt to the movement that we do, you can get a ton of movement nutrients from water but you can\'t get all of them. So many people will use water as a therapeutic approach. And not just children but adults because for those who experience pain when they bear weight it\'s a way to allow them to continue to move. I get it. It\'s fun. You can use water in many ways. You can certainly increase the movement nutrition found in a bout of swimming by considering all of the ways that you use your body and what you\'re doing when you come to a body of water. \xa0For kids, I just would recommend just like maybe as a nutritionist would to make sure that swimming wasn\'t the only motion that was being done. It\'s certainly better than nothing and it\'s absolutely something to be doing regularly to build up that skill set. But I don\'t think that it replaces another movement nutrient. So that\'s my only commentary on it. Do I think it\'s awesome? Rad. Do I count it as movement? Yes. So, am I wrong? Yeah, I would say that if you thought that I don\'t see swimming as a natural movement or something valuable, that\'s absolutely not the case. I would like to ensure that everyone had the ability to move through water in the best way that they can. So anyway. Thanks, Kate!', 'So, here’s a question from Ines, who writes… ""The last time I bought shoes I chose one size larger than I have been buying in the past years. Do you know whether increased foot mobility actually can lead to lengthening and expanding of the feet? Is that a thing? I\'ve been doing the exercises from', ' and ', ', as well as walking lots more in general and in minimal shoes. And alternatively, could it simply be that I\'m more aware of toe and wiggle-space, such that previously I wasn\'t realizing my shoes were too small but now I am? Thank you and just so you know, your work is having an impact on my life!"" And obviously your feet, Ines. So thank you for this question. It\'s a great question. So I would say that it can be both. It could be that maybe really maybe you hadn\'t been paying attention to what your toes were doing in shoes before that your toes might not even have been extended to their full length before. Many people, especially generations previously where you might only get one pair of shoes a year when you were a kid, a lot of people report that they learned how to shorten their toes or kind of claw their toes which makes their whole foot length less because they did not like the sensation of bumping up against the end of their shoe and they were obviously growing while they were wearing their shoes. So it could be that, yes, you had just now started to feel the way your toes are interacting with your shoes and so you are buying a shoe one size larger because now that gives you the space but also quite often people experience an increase in the size of their foot. And so it\'s interesting this idea of mobility seem to again, in our minds, we hold in a vacuum which is like, my toes can just go through greater ranges of motion. Whether it\'s spreading apart, lifting up high, and that is true, but at the same time it\'s also not happening in a vacuum meaning if you have a lot of foot tension, the resting length of your foot is less. So when people develop strength in the rest of their foot, they change the height of the arch. So in ', ' I was really trying to call out that you are actually changing the lengths, you\'re changing the lengths of certain segments. Because you\'re usually measuring length along one particular plane. So it\'s not that the bones themselves are getting longer, it\'s that when you start playing around with multiple planes of orientation you will affect things like length. Same thing like height. They took my dad to the doctor - this is going to be a classic Katy Bowman aside - When I took my dad to the doctor they measured his height. \xa0And it was like, ""Oh you shrunk an inch."" He was 89. And so she was just quickly explaining that the volume of your discs gets less and you know that can be one case. And I said, ""Also though, if you\'re not measuring how much farther forward his head or shoulders are, it can be that if your spine is just curling forward, your height is now traveling around a curve and not straight up."" So since you\'re measuring height along the wall it could just be that he\'s more forward. And it was like, ""uh...what?"" And then I showed her quickly the math. \xa0If you just take a string and move it forward, I said, ""you see height, his segment length, hasn\'t changed. He doesn\'t necessarily have shorter vertebral bodies."" The height of the vertebrae themselves, or less mass in the disk. It\'s just oriented in a different plane than what you were measuring. Same with the foot. So maybe that\'s the holdup. It\'s like, ""Could my bones be getting longer?"" Probably not. Could you have through muscle tension constantly chronically holding your foot to a functional length that is different than what those segments of your bones allowed? \xa0Yes. So anyway. You\'re welcome, Ines, for that long sidebar about the time I had with my dad. I guess you know when people pass away don\'t you want to talk about them all the time? I do. And when you combine that with someone who also wants to just talk all the time? There you go. Anyway, thank you ', ' everyone else in the collective: ', ', ', '; maker of beautiful dynamic living space decor, and ', ' outdoor boots for kids. For more information on these companies go to the show notes, click listen, ', "". They're linked on the top of the notes. And if you have a question please send it to me via "", "". I want to answer it. So let's do this."", 'KATY: ', 'PHILIP: Hello. Thank you!', ""KATY: We were trying to talk briefly about how we met and neither one of us can remember the name of the conference but Saskatchewan First Nations, we believe it's the nutritionist…?"", ""PHILIP: \xa0Yeah it took place at the Treaty Four Governance center in Fort Qu'Appelle Saskatchewan and yeah, I believe it was Health Canada. It was dieticians there from throughout the province, of course, different first nations staff. I think mostly health staff that were present about a year and a half ago. "", ""KATY: Yeah. \xa0It was September. So I guess we're on the year and a half mark. It was beautiful and so we got a chance to work together. And I'm just really happy that you are here for reasons I think will become obvious. You are really immersed in a lot of things that maybe my listeners here understand in a theoretical way - or they're trying to learn more about maybe their role in their environment and I just think that your perspective - your work - is so important so I'd like to share it. So I guess I'd like to start with my first questions which is: What does Natural Movement mean to you?"", ""PHILIP: Yeah. And that's such a juggernaut of a question. \xa0You know, because I think natural movement really goes and affects all aspects of life whether it be our physical health, the health of our - our mental health politics, and our life practices every day, in trying to find a sustainable path forward for future generations. So on just a practical level, as an individual, natural movement is something that, as I'm aging and beginning to feel the aches and pains from my life, it's become very much of a conscious effort to go back to movements that our ancestors would have been familiar with, you know, finding just better ways to sit, or to squat, and to walk. All of these different ways that we see the toll that sitting in chairs or our cars and what have you, or repetitive movement through industrialized working conditions - just to see what that's doing to our bodies and doing to our communities and doing to our ability to maintain cultural health in our communities."", ""PHILIP: Right. Yeah well for myself, indigenous food sovereignty is really recognizing just how important our food culture is to the overall well being of indigenous nations. I mean we can expand that out to all human culture but of course, I spend my time as an indigenous person focused on reclaiming indigenous ways of knowing and being, recovering from the effects of colonialism here in North America. \xa0And in my journey in life whether it be participating in our spiritual institutes and ceremonies, or whether it be just some of our festivals, such as Pow Wow or other aspects of culture, I've come to understand that our food culture really is the core."", 'KATY: Um-hmm.', ""PHILIP: People will say language is the foundation of our culture where I would argue that it's actually our food culture that is the foundation and it's that food culture that gave birth to our languages."", 'KATY: Mm.', ""PHILIP: So we see in language recovery of indigenous languages, the language retention doesn't seem to really get traction when students are trying to learn in a classroom environment. But when we put them back on the land and when they're on the land that usually always has something to do with food production or food foraging because that, essentially, is how our ancestors spent their entire day was in the pursuit of food. So when we are on the land we quickly begin to reconnect with all of those - the linguistic sort of metaphors and references that are all on the land in our local ecosystem. So linguistically our indigenous languages they were emergent from our local ecosystems and from that life of food culture on the land."", ""KATY: Ok so we're gonna speak about language for a second. \xa0What is being on the land mean to you? Or what's the definition of that term as you're using it?"", 'PHILIP: Yeah well that too is dynamic and huge. I mean, being on the land - in a modern sense?', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""PHILIP: \xa0Well just in the modern sense, I mean, making a conscious effort to be out on the land as and then to redesign our lives on a daily practice. Where does our food come from? How do we value natural landscapes? Are we able to design our school schedules and curriculum in order to help support being on the land - being immersed on a regular basis so we nurture sort of ecological literacy in our children? As indigenous people, I mean, our relationship with the land is inseparable and we don't have temples. Our spiritual interaction is so tied with what we'd call our spiritual grandfathers or grandmothers. The spiritual entities that are actually, they reside in the physical landscape. Whether it be the rocks, the soil, the grasses, the plant medicine, the trees. We recognize that these have spiritual consciousness and by immersing ourselves in it, we are able to gain contact and to actually have a reciprocal relationship of communication with that landscape."", 'PHILP: Well I think that of course, it\'s therapeutic. It\'s essential to our long-term well being as a species. I think, though, if we are only to take it in small doses, that\'s not adequate. \xa0It\'s not adequate for our well being as a species going forward for centuries. I think already our dispossession from the land over the last century is already having such dramatic and devastating consequences on our physical, mental and spiritual health. So to take half measures of say, ""let\'s just tweak our daily habits"" or ""tweak our school curriculum"" I don\'t think that it\'s going to be enough. I think that we really have to look at making some drastic, systemic change in how we live.', ""KATY: So being on the land then, there's a volume to it. So it's not just like going outside and being in a green space. It also includes maybe having a portion of your dwelling or as you said this food culture is relating back to the land. So I want to talk to you a little bit since it is therapeutic - now a lot of the work that you do is with, is it just boys or boys and girls where you're actually bringing them back into being on the land. So can you share some of what that - what the process of it and what some of the outcomes you've witnessed are."", ""PHILIP: \xa0Right. Well, for the most part, it's only been with boys. I have done a little bit of work with girls from our local school as well - took some girls the other year on a fishing camp. \xa0The reason I work with boys is because there is someone else in the community that specifically works with girls. I guess I have the privilege I guess, in my family, I had a father who was a scholar and a professor but he had also grew up on land very much as a boy and had hunting and fishing skills. That was a very important part of our life growing up. And I have one older brother, he's 9 years older, who also taught me as I was growing to be a boy. And I really took to that. I always felt a deep sense of belonging on the land and on the water. So from a very young age, I thrived in that environment and it was my first priority in life was to make sure that I was spending as much time being on the land and learning about my local environment and the skills that went with that. \xa0And then being the youngest in my family I began to have nieces and nephews by the time I was a teenager. And so a lot of my nephews, I began to teach them as well. That was a little over 20 years ago. So yeah, I spent a lot of time, many many trips - hunting trips, fishing trips - with my nephews. And then in the last four or five years here living on the Peepeekisis I had the opportunity to begin working with the youth in the community. I took a job as the community wellness coordinator which essentially is kind of the portfolio of a sport and rec, but also drug and alcohol and gang prevention. Because of course addiction and gang activity is always a struggle in any community stricken with poverty. So my way of connecting with a lot of the boys who seemed most at risk was to simply approach them and ask them if they wanted to go hunting with me. \xa0And of course, they would jump at that opportunity. And as I've come to learn, 95% of the boys that I worked with didn't have a father figure in their life. So it quickly turned into some very deep relationships that I hadn't envisioned at the onset but I built some relationships with some fabulous young men and, you know, they were labeled as criminals and as drug dealers and vandals and that sort of thing. But they were also very much social leaders. And carried a lot of influence in the community with their peers. And so that circle quickly grew. Word got out that Phil was the guy who, jump in Phil's truck and you'd be off on some adventure for the weekend. We'd go hunting moose or go fishing for the weekend or something."", ""KATY: I want you to hear a little bit more of what this is like. So I'm gonna play a clip of a radio piece made by "", ""who was a journalism student who at the university in Regina in Saskatchewan Canada. This first aired on her school's radio show 2945. Katie tagged along with Philip and some of the boys. Have a listen:"", ""KATY: If you want to hear more of Katie Sawatzky's radio documentary you can connect with her on "", "" or find her on Facebook. I'll also link to her in the show notes. Here's more of my conversation with Philip."", 'KATY: So you have found essentially community leaders and redirected them essentially back to being on the land and to some success have you seen?', ""PHILIP: Well yeah I mean it's hard to measure success. I mean you, I run into the issue of just capacity."", 'KATY: Sure.', ""PHILIP: I'm only one person, one individual. I can only spend so much time with individuals. And that's the challenge, right? Of course, when you are dealing with youth who are living in poverty and in crisis you have to be available for them because they're constantly facing challenges day to day that sometimes derail any progress that you're making. But yeah, this plants seeds. You know sometimes even if you don't see results in a year or two years, I mean sometimes it takes many years. But you've planted a seed in somebody. They might have a hard road to walk for a while but when you introduce young people to a relationship with the land I think that's something they never will forget and maybe at some point in their life they're going to come back to it."", 'KATY: I\'m sort of laughing at my question. I have to apologize for my questions about... it\'s just such a .. my cultural and way that I\'ve been trained to see the world. \xa0""Tell me about the successes."" The fact that you were out there was a success. So again, I can just hear myself. That is such, that is my cultural bias - to not only value the moment by moment but tell me about ... tell me about the mass application of the things. That was just Katy Bowman acknowledge problematic potentially element in her own way of seeing things. So thank you for so graciously responding to my cultural bias there.', ""PHILIP: We've all been hardwired to looking for results, right."", 'KATY: Yes. \xa0Thank you for being with me in that moment. I appreciate that.', 'PHILIP: All right.', ""KATY: Anyway, I'm just trying to think of so many different directions I can go. So you have a young child, right? \xa0Is he five?"", ""PHILIP: \xa0He'll be 6 on the 19th. \xa0A few days."", ""KATY: That's just a few days after my son's. They're really close birthday. But we were talking about, I'm not sure if your son attended, but that there were some... we have a local nature school here but you said that there was a Cree? \xa0Cree-school where they were creating a way of introducing early language but recognizing that all the language is essentially centered - it's all nature-based language, right? Because what else is there if you're a natured based people."", 'PHILIP: Right.', ""KATY: \xa0With the axis of your culture being food, it's all going to be related to things that you eat and have to move through. So what would you like to see happen with that way of preserving language and also simultaneously relationship with identity and landscape?"", 'KATY: Language gardens. What a beautiful solution. I love that.', ""PHILIP: Yeah. And also with natural movement. Gettin' our fingers dirty."", ""KATY: That's all it is, yeah. \xa0Exactly And just being outside is natural movement. It's kind of been reduced to sprinting and throwing rocks and squatting but it really is all of the interactions with all that is in the natural world. And that just includes standing outside in a breeze. You know, that's definitely also natural movement. So I remember we were talking a while ago when we were together and you had noted that your personal family has practices that kind of make you an outlier within your own community. Like you don't have a tv in your home, for example. How, and as far as even hunting goes. Are you an outlier within your own community because of the extent to which you are comfortable being on the land or have you noticed a change? How do you feel, I guess, having this knowledge or this understanding and wanting to expand it? How do you feel relative to the rest of your community?"", ""PHILIP: \xa0Right. Well, I think I live a life of obscurity no matter where I go. I'm a little bit of a different creature than the peers I grew up with. But, yeah, you know, in the reality of a lot of First Nations communities, and it varies widely. I mean a lot of First Nations communities do have a very much of a homogeneous identity and a lot of cultural, traditional ways do survive. For others, you can go down the road to a different community and it's going to be drastically different. And that's very much in the instance of my community. \xa0I think the effects of colonialism, competing churches and religious institutions and then also the influence of the television and pop culture has pulled our people in so many different directions into such different states of consciousness. And so it's very difficult to bring our community together and have, and share a lot of commonalities that were there just two generations ago. Our grandparents. Our grandparents had a robust food culture in the community. Everybody was growing good food up until the 1970s. You know, people had social relationships built around helping one another whether it was canning food, hunting together, fishing together. We used to have a lot of fishing happened in our community. \xa0Up until maybe 1980, but then our local lakes have become so polluted due to agricultural runoff and also raw sewage being released by surrounding cities into our water system. So we've lost a lot of that due to that. But yeah, I mean, a lot of the other fellows who are hunters here in our community, they might hunt, but they're not hunting for the same reasons that I might be hunting. I see a lot of them might have adopted sort of Americana version of hunting. Trophy hunting. You know, looking for the big buck."", 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', ""PHILIP: They watch the hunting channel and this is where they've learned their hunting skills and implemented them. Because we kind of had a lost generation there. And I think a lot of in my father's generation it really hit rock bottom where nobody, really nobody was keeping that alive and well. And so in our generation, you see people getting back into it but some of them aren't getting back into it for the same reason. And for me, they're fundamentally different. They're very different. And they encourage a very different worldview."", ""PHILIP: Right. Yeah, well I mean it gets into discussions around privilege, sustainability, does the natural world, is it able to provide for humanity as we now head towards 8 billion people. Yeah, I mean I don't have the solutions for all of humanity..."", 'KATY: Right.', ""PHILIP: ...and I always think of ecosystems. The planet WAS a huge and diverse planet with so many different ecosystems. And the culture, the human cultures reflected that. The diversity in human cultures reflected that. And the big elephant in the room is monoculture. Whether it's mono-crops or it's the melting pot of monoculture in humanity. I know that so many see that as an honorable pursuit but myself, I'm very leery of that. I see great danger in pursuing mono-culture. Diversity is key to resilience as human beings. So I think there's many different answers for different peoples where they are. And solutions going forward are going to be very diverse. You know, where I live, no present day, the province of Saskatchewan, I mean, you know, we're a massive - we're the size of California, Oregon, and Washington put together. And there's only 1 million people there - or here in that massive space. And we have 2/3 of that is boreal forest. \xa0So we do have a different reality than say those people living in California as far as how much our natural systems can carry us forward. So I think for myself as an indigenous person, though, and this is something that gets lost and I think a lot of conversations when it comes around protecting land, you know, something people should be familiar with is the UN declaration of the rights of indigenous peoples. When it comes around who has first right of access to maintaining a land-based lifestyle - they're hunting and gathering - I don't see the capacity for everybody and it's not a reality for everybody to live that lifestyle. But as indigenous peoples, we certainly have a right. Here in Canada we certainly do have that right to hunt, to fish, to gather, year round. We don't have to adhere by hunting seasons. But of course that's always under threat and there's always pressure from mainstream society to eliminate that. And I think there is always this pressure to assimilate. To do away with our way of life. \xa0Which essentially is genocide. That's cultural genocide."", 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', ""PHILIP: If you want to do away with that land-based lifestyle you essentially are you're reducing our cultural practices just down to very shadow spectacles of entertainment. You know, dressing up and dancing at a pow wow. But it really has no spiritual or ecological substance. And if we remove ourselves as indigenous peoples from our actual ecological function - we are key species on this continent. Just like the bison were. The bison and indigenous peoples were a part of the reciprocal relationship that actually made grasslands healthy here on the plains. With both indigenous peoples and the bison being removed. \xa0You know, we find ourselves, society finds itself searching for all sorts of ways to maintain grassland health but - cattle and rotational grazing and these sorts of things. But I think that when you remove indigenous peoples from the ecosystems that they emerged from, it's inevitable that that ecosystem will collapse and so will that indigenous human culture. It will collapse. So it's very important that we try to bring those connections back together for the betterment of all of u really."", 'KATY: Right.', 'PHILIP: Maybe I went off topic there.', ""KATY: No I don't think so. I don't think it's off topic. I think that what happens is these are super complex issues and we're so used to talking about food over here and language over here and human rights over here and ecology over here and it's become so parsed that we kind of forget that it's - there's just one system."", 'PHILIP: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Just one thing happening with so many moving parts that it's so complicated that the tendency is just to think of global solutions. You know? And to recognize the wholeness of it, of something, is also dependent on the wholeness of each of the parts. And that's I guess what I most appreciate about your answer. So no, it wasn't off topic at all. Is this idea again that there's an idea that equality would mean the single solution for everyone to have exactly the same thing throughout the globe and what I hear you expressing, I believe, not to put words in your mouth, would be that the needs are local to the ecosystems and you can define local, I guess, at lots of different levels. It's that complicated. To keep thinking about it. And I also think it's really just to tie into what you said now to what you said earlier this idea that language is springing forth culture is springing forth from a local ecosystem that this diversity that you see throughout the world includes the language and the cultures and the landscapes and the way that people interact with the landscapes that it's all tied together. And that preservation of culture indeed requires preservation of the relationships that caused it to express, perhaps."", 'PHILIP: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: \xa0It reminds me of another conversation. Seems like we had a lot of conversations when we were together. We were talking about tobacco. So you were talking about not wanting to reduce a culture to maybe the symbolic, like the symbols of a culture, but the behaviors. And you were talking about tobacco. And of course I am interested in - my personal practices include 30 and 40-mile walks. You know, like these things where I feel like this is how I relate to my landscape is to physically walk across it. And you were talking about I guess the spiritual practice of exchanging tobacco but it being relating to the work that one had to do to gather it. If you could share some of that, I think that would help solidify for people listening who, I would say the bulk of our listeners are not indigenous peoples. And the idea of what is a spiritual practice? I mean everyone has their own spiritual practices. Let's talk about tobacco. What is that relationship with tobacco, the exchange of it, what does all of it entail? You know, in a few minutes."", 'PHILIP: Right sure. Well you know you have diversity with different linguistic indigenous groups throughout North America but I think the bulk, the majority of us, we do all have a common relationship with tobacco or some sort of form of tobacco. Here on the northern plains, we didn\'t actually use a tobacco plant. We never had a tobacco plant but we made a tobacco - a smoking blend used in our pipes. \xa0And we would use, we would call it kinnikinnick - which is bearberry, the bearberry leaf. And then that would be sort of the base and then the inner bark of the red willow tree and then other plant medicines added to that. So the procurement of that was very labor intensive. And it would also involve travel and sometimes trade. \xa0In some instances - and you would see variety too, depending on where you are. You know, how far north you are - you would see diversity in that tobacco blend depending on people\'s surrounding flora and fauna right? \xa0But yeah, tobacco is always the center trade item but when I say trade item I mean when in buying, purchasing anything from - in a modern sense if I was to go to an elder and I want to learn a song, a traditional song, I would first and foremost use tobacco. \xa0Tobacco has to be offered. And the amount, now has changed. Because now you buy a packet of cigarettes or a packet of a pouch of tobacco. But traditional it would just be enough to fill the bowl of a pipe because that interaction that you would share with one another would begin, would commence with a pipe ceremony. So that tobacco would be offered for the prayer to commence that interaction. So tobacco is a very sacred tool that we use. But I\'ve been interested in exploring what is lost in that process that we had traditionally in procuring that tobacco. The amount of walking that went into it. And as indigenous peoples, whenever we are on the land doing something whether it\'s hunting, whether it\'s picking medicines, there is also a massive amount of oral knowledge that goes along with it. There is creation stories that go along with that activity. There\'s songs that go with that activity. There are specific prayers that go with that activity. So when we remove ourselves from that actual land-based lifestyle - of gathering \xa0- the knowledge and the stories and the songs begin to fall away as well. And when I talk to giving value to something, giving spiritual power and value to that handful of tobacco it would have been infused with that power through the labor that that person might do to gather it and through the songs and prayers that they had infused into that tobacco. So when it arrived at its destination it had great value. Where now today, you know, so many people, we just look to convenience. And we only see the surface of things. We don\'t put any deep thought into, or action into the procurement of the items in this convenience culture. You run to the corner store and get a pack of cigarettes and go see an elder and say ""ok can I get this song from you?"" So much has been lost in that. Right? And I think we sell ourselves short to just say we can exchange one for the other. They\'re fundamentally different.', ""KATY: Yeah, it's a difference between a vitamin C tablet and an orange."", 'PHILIP: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. You need the fiber, right? And you need the substance. ', 'KATY: And maybe even the work to pick it or the knowledge of how to plant it.', ""PHILIP: And this is how it gets back to natural movement right? \xa0The consequence of this is we see it affecting our bodies. The obesity epidemic in First Nations communities is astronomical. And Diabetes. Early onset diabetes in our children. \xa0In fact, I think our stat here, children born in the year 2000, they're now becoming young adults, 18 years old, 2 out of 3 are expected to have diabetes before the age of 40. You know an example of this too, I took a group of boys, grade 5, 10 and 11-year old boys. I had nine of them. I took them out on a trap line snaring rabbits. Four out of the nine were too obese to even walk for more than 4 or 5 minutes in the snow over the deadfall and simply had to return back to the van. \xa0This is the reality of our people. This is the reality and this is the effect of being disposed from a land-based lifestyle."", ""KATY: Yes. It's interesting, you know, in the realms in which I work there's a resonating idea that movement and land-based practices, although I'm not sure that you would read that terminology are in our DNA, and then, of course, when you've had people removed from the land for a longer period of time - hundreds and thousands of years - you kind of adapt to not needing those inputs as much as a culture like yours, so recently removed from the land. I think that was maybe one of the first conversations that we had - where the consequences are so much...they're so different for populations being forcefully, actively, displaced. And I'm trying to point out convenience and sedentarism and the relationship of that. And at first glance, it's because of health. We can talk about things like diabetes and survival statistics but ultimately I'm very interested in movement ecology and what happens when you have masses of people becoming sedentary - how does that relate to cultural diversity? How does my belief that I have entitlement, privilege of sedentarism, ultimately start encroaching on others. These are more complex questions, but it really is my personal evolution and my relationship to movement for my personal health to the health and well being of others. And that's really only a commentary to maybe for the listeners to tie in so much of my work to maybe some of the things that you are speaking of. Your things that you're speaking of alone are super important. They're of such greater importance than I would say the way my knees and my hips feel but just to kind of give people a sense of sedentarism and a lack of being able to move in a natural world is, I think, a really so much more important thing than our personal health. You know what I mean? I guess if that makes sense."", ""PHILIP: You bet. I say it's always - in our traditional teachings, you know, never be human-centric."", 'KATY: Right.', ""PHILIP: Western society is all about human centricity. \xa0When we talk about climate change or we talk about how is this gonna affect ... I always see people saying the same things: How is this going to affect human being? Well, we have to stop just thinking about human beings. We have to think about the planet holistically. All life. Life systems. And that, of course, comes back to us. But in our teachings, we put human beings at the bottom. And we have something called wahkohtowin. Wahkotowin is a loose translation is kinship. \xa0But it's actually - there's a lot of complex protocols. Wahkohtowin kind of governs family and tribal relationships between people but it also recognizes our relationships with all of our life relatives: all of the animal world. The plant world. The medicine world. Everything. We're recognizing the ecosystem that you live in and how it functions - observing how it functions. Understanding the roles and relationships between all different life forms in that ecosystem. Figuring out where do we fit in. \xa0What role do we play in the health and well being of the function of that ecosystem and therefore we acclimate to its care and capacity? That's the definition of an indigenous culture. That's indigenous people. And so as we would enter and migrate into a new territory, we would be very highly observant of that care and capacity and the relationships with it and always place ourselves at the bottom and say, as long as we respect and take care of this ecosystem's natural function, it will always take care of us forever going forward. That's sustainability. Where you take the human-centric western worldview of dominance to put something under the plow and to essentially obliterate an ecosystem for human consumption needs - so we see this now where the grasslands of North America, 90% of it has been turned into mono-crops that are sprayed with insecticides. "", 'KATY: Right.', ""PHILIP: \xa0What has been lost in that, it's been absolutely devastating. It's ongoing devastation to human cultures and to the function of - What did those natural grasslands, what was their role in carbon sequestration and everything else - in the function of the planet? \xa0So we always have to look bigger than our own needs."", 'KATY: Yeah. And our own desires. Personal preferences.', 'PHILIP: Well yeah. You bet. Yeah.', ""KATY: So here's my question. My last question for you is, how is your work, what you'd like to accomplish, what you and your community require, how is that best supported by non-indigenous folks?"", 'PHILIP: Well there again, diversity is key, right? Get to know indigenous peoples in whatever territory you\'re living in. \xa0Their needs on the coast where you are are gonna be very different than the needs of my community. That\'s the first rule, I guess. And then also the importance of not being rescuers. Not being - coming into an indigenous community and saying ""hey I can see what you guys problem is and I know how to fix it."" \xa0We\'ve had that for a century. And it always falls flat. I think that there\'s a lot of very smart young indigenous people in communities all across North America. They know what they need. But they\'re lacking the means. As we know, most of the wealth in the U.S. and Canada is in the hands of non-indigenous, not people of color still hold that power. \xa0And wealth. And so just supporting what other initiatives that are already happening I think is important.', 'KATY: Do you have a couple good examples? \xa0I mean we can put them in the show notes and point people to great indigenous lead, local community or even larger scale climate work?', ""PHILIP: I think climate work is really important and I think anybody who is doing food sovereignty. I mean there's all kinds of food sovereignty... like I was saying - that's the core. That's the core. Everything else when you're putting food sovereignty and issues back together that begins to heal the social fabric of a community. That brings back the language. That brings back economic prosperity. That beings to heal all of that that's been frayed. And so, for myself, that's where I see the most focus is needed, in those food sovereignty initiatives and I bet you in the U.S., every reservation is going to have a fairly good-sized community of people very conscious of that and moving forward with that. I know there's a lot of conferences even more so in the U.S. than there is in Canada around food sovereignty. In fact, I think there's one in your area very soon coming up."", 'KATY: There is, in Seattle.', ""PHILIP: In Seattle, right. \xa0And I think there's another one in Iowa and another one in Sioux Falls South Dakota. \xa0So yeah, I think that's a really good thing to be supporting. Here for myself locally, I've partnered with the Nature Conservancy of Canada. We've had the whole truth and reconciliation process happening. It's very controversial - all stemming from the residential schools but we had the truth and reconciliation commission come out with 94 recommendations for both government and NGO organizations to take on in a healing process going forward for indigenous peoples in this country. \xa0I couldn't list them all. You can google it. "", "". But different organizations might be able to say, adopt one or two. And so the Nature Conservancy of Canada because they have land, here in Saskatchewan they have, I believe, 150 thousand acres of natural prairie. They said well how do we, what role has the dispossession from the land - what role has that played in indigenous communities so how can we be of service. So going forward I'll be working with them doing some contract work, exploring some land-based education opportunities. Getting First Nation schools/kids out onto natural prairie. They have buffalo, they have some massive buffalo herds in some of their bigger properties in the south of the province and they want to do partnerships with indigenous communities with raising buffalo. They also want to do food sovereignty initiatives. Really explore - right now we're in very early days of exploring what all can we do. And over the next year I'll probably be going out to communities throughout the province, First Nations communities, on behalf of the NCC letting some of our people know about the NCC and what sort of work they are able to do but they're also taking that approach of letting first nations persons like myself - let's go to communities. Let's see what they can do. How can they be of support? \xa0They're not prescribing a solution themselves. They're just saying hey, we have land, how can it be of use."", ""KATY: \xa0Well thank you for all of that. Those are many many action items so I appreciate that. And I also appreciate you taking your time from your much more important work than being on my podcast to come and share your perspective and inform many.

All bodies are welcome. \xa0Are you ready to get moving?', 'Music', ""KATY: \xa0Hey friends. I am almost on my way to Europe where I will be spending times in cities like Cambridge, Hamburg, Barcelona, and more! \xa0Do not be the person who sends me a social media comment full of emojis mostly crying saying I can't believe that you came to my town and I didn't know. Go check out my website, "", "" and my live events and you will find where I am going to be in Europe. There are a few spots open in various places. Speaking of traveling when I was in Amsterdam last year I was blown away by this section where instead of having a bunch of flat and level seating - you know the drill when you go into an airport: it's miles and miles of chairs back to back - it had this stadium seating which had these stairs that you could walk up and down, a big flat stretching area at the top, and a slide that went down through the middle of it all. Not just for kids, but for everyone. So it was just a very textured experience while I was waiting there for the three hours that I had to be there. So I'm always interested in the way that cities are designed to move the people that live there and of course vice versa. So, in this episode of Move Your DNA we're gonna be talking about City Moves. We're going to talk about walkability and how cities an built environments shape us. We're also gonna hear about mobility justice. What's that you ask? Stay tuned to find out. But first, here's a question from our mailbag:\xa0"", ' So Ruth, first thing I will do is point you to the episode, ', "". If you haven't listened to that, that is, I would say, a nice long toe-dip into a shorter answer that I'll give here. I'll also link to that in the show notes if you are a new listener and haven't heard it yet. But the parse the question, the idea of stretching has changed over time. And I think a lot of it has to do with the terms that we use. We call it a stretch often because of the way something feels, not necessarily what's happening on a smaller perspective. Like not considering a whole muscle but a sarcomere which is a part of a muscle. So I think a lot of times a lot of times a muscle lengthens, we automatically think of that as stretching. As I answered in "", "", someone can be doing the exercise called the calf stretch and not even be stretching their calfs because of the mobility that they have. The biggest answer to your question - what's the context of my stretching or how should I be doing my stretching? \xa0I would say, with a lot of other movement of all of the other parts all day long. So the calf stretch is really just a movement. It's just trying to move some of you. So if you did the calf stretch, out calf stretch exercise which is you putting the ball of your foot on something, I don't know, 2-3 inches high while your heel is still on the ground and taking a step forward to put that ankle in a little bit of dorsiflexion so instead of pointing your toes you're now doing the opposite there. Your foot has moved closer to your shin. It's a smaller angle at the ankle. That's the same thing that happens when you walk uphill. And you wouldn't call it a calf stretch then maybe because the duration that you're experiencing it is much shorter. But simply all we're doing, if we could get rid of the term stretch and strengthen and just talk about movement and loads that might make things a little bit more clear. These are very early delineations at the beginning of movement science which we're still in but I think that over time we'll see a lot of these terms like endurance and strength, when we get down to the nuts and bolts of them, they don't really have strong, measurable definitions. We're trying to find or maybe even create language to better parse this natural phenomenon of moving. When people ask for a movement prescription, I'd say that it really depends on what you are doing particular movements for. For many people they do the calf stretch simply to eek a little bit of movement in the lower part of their leg. That can be someone who is very immobile, not necessarily in the ankle sense but maybe in the whole body sense. So therapeutically maybe they're given this exercise prescription to move a, what is now currently a sedentary area, the goal isn't to have longer calves, the goal is to not have immobility. So in that case, simply moving that area, the cells in that area, is movement. Whether it's a stretch or a strengthening it doesn't matter. It's just taking an area of the body that isn't moving at all and moving it around. And so for most corrective exercises, ultimately that's more my perspective is identifying - in"", ' I call them sticky as the terminology has expanded we can also call them sedentary areas within an otherwise active body. We\'re just trying to find those areas and move them. And so we have strong parameters I would say around the form of our various stretches or correctives specifically to move those areas. So we call it the calf stretch but if you wanted to cross out stretch and just put move, the calf move is stepping the ball of your foot up on a dome, dropping your heel down, and stepping forward to the other side. So that\'s just this general idea of let\'s take and either immobile body or a body that\'s mobile in some areas and immobile in others and start moving certain areas. It doesn\'t matter what it\'s called. We don\'t have any other goal but to move it. Now, there is, then, the second layer which is, I\'m actually pretty active and maybe I use a range of motion of my ankle to how I have been doing it to a certain extent but I\'d like it to be able to cover a greater distance within my own body. Like to be able to use more of my joints when I\'m moving around. So now our goal shifts not only to move that area but to have that area allow a greater range of motion without so much resistance in it. Because you can go beyond your active ranges of motion into the passive ranges of motion. That\'s often what we call a stretch. \xa0But not always. Sometimes it\'s just a lack of strength. So in that case then it\'s not only just step up on your calf stretch a couple days to move this immobile area it\'s ok let\'s look at the shoes that you\'re wearing and let\'s look at how much you\'re sitting. And let\'s look at how much you are or are not walking uphill or downhill. And then the prescription for a greater range of motion starts to exceed only stepping up on the dome. Although I guess if you were unable to add those more non-exercise movements, then it would be ok, then maybe step up on your dome 60 minutes a day, right? Because in the end all we\'re trying to do is increase the frequency and the distribution of that motion so that you can adapt. So your body keeps the ranges of motions that it uses most frequently. So if you only move your calf in the calf stretch 3 minutes, maybe 3 minutes 3 times a day, that\'s only 9 minutes. And even if you do that 7 days a week, that\'s less than 100 minutes out of 10,000 minutes. So you can see that the signal to adapt isn\'t very strong. It\'s almost undetectable. Will you still receive benefits on a cellular level that you\'re moving? Absolutely. So it\'s not that it\'s not valuable it\'s just that when we\'re talking about things like increasing joint mobility, the - I think one of the reasons you\'re seeing a lot of stretching doesn\'t work, etc., it\'s very hard, again, this goes back to good delineation in research is, often times the goal of stretching is to increase joint range of motion. So the exercise prescriptions are stretches x, y, and z. And the measure is how many degrees can a certain joint move before and after. And then they\'ll find, hey stretching isn\'t working to increase the joint range of motion. And so now we have a whole ""stretching doesn\'t work. Get rid of that move."" \xa0Because, again, in a sedentary culture we\'re often excited of getting rid of movement. But it could also be that stretching 9 minutes or 100 minutes if you did it daily out of 10,000 minutes is not sufficient to increase joint range of motion. And so we have to keep your owl eyes and your deer ears on to use language from nature school, when you\'re reading clinical work so that even though, you know, it might be ""Stretching Doesn\'t Work"" is the headline, kind of the click bait, if you will, but after you parse it a little bit you can say ""ok well what this paper is saying is that this volume of this type of movement doesn\'t elicit this type of response."" So, again, I used stretching to get into areas or we\'ll call them stretches, to get into areas that are otherwise that are not really mobile within my own body and then I look for where that stretch or that movement that I\'m creating in the exercise can be at greater volume either by adding something to my lifestyle or removing something to my lifestyle, like furniture. So furniture - getting rid of furniture - for me was one way that I added a much greater volume of ""hip stretches"". Although now they\'re not hip stretches anymore. It\'s just me just using the range of motion of my hip. Because when the volume of whatever hip stretch I was doing before which was at the 3 minutes at the end of my cardio aerobics class I used to teach 5 times a week. That used to be my volume and I never made that much progress. I got rid of furniture and hey I\'m doing that exercise 2 hours a day every single day of my life. Turns out that my body shifts it\'s shape to match that volume. So I don\'t think I\'ve addressed all of your specific questions but hopefully that gives you a sense of how to explain maybe some of the things that you\'re reading and how to see how stretching - that what you are after is what answers your questions for you here. So I\'d like to thank both Ruth for the question and also the Dynamic Collective which is this amazing group of companies supporting this podcast. We\'ve got ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ': all minimal footwear companies. And ', ', making awesome minimal furniture. They sponsor the question and the answer part of each episode of Move Your DNA. \xa0You can find more about them in your show notes. And if you have a question, send it to me via ', '. I want to answer it. ', ""I've been thinking a lot about "", "" lately from a few episodes back. We talked a lot about how your environment shapes you. Maybe you're a river person or a mountain person. So many of us live in cities now. More than 80% of Americans live in urban areas so we are being shaped by the cities in which we live. We've talked a lot on this podcast about some of the elements of cities that shape us. The abundance of flat and level surfaces on which to walk and the feeling that nature is harder to find in cities, the way that traveling by car or bus can be the default. If you live in an urban or suburban area you may have noticed that your town or city is built primarily for car traffic with pedestrian traffic an afterthought. However there are a number of organizations and individuals working to move that focus to human scale development. For example, if you haven't checked out "", "", the book or the website, this is one of their goals from their website: \xa0We help communities reinvent streets, neighborhoods, towns and cities for people, not for cars. So how structures move is I'm excited to say is definitely on the radar of many. This is not my podcast or even a Katy Bowman centralized idea. This is something that many different organizations work on daily. So today we're gonna start off with some basics when it comes to this topic."", ""SAMANTHA: \xa0Thank you for having me. It's a delight."", ""KATY: So I want to just lay a foundation of basics for those who have never really thought of cities having designs or shapes to them. I mean certainly if 80% of at least Americans are in some sort of city shape, it's nice to start I guess recognizing some of the terminology that people are using when they're building or considering or reconsidering shapes. Walkability will be what we talk about today. So what is walkability as you define it?"", ""SAMANTHA: Yeah. \xa0Well walkability is more than sidewalks. It's more than just that physical infrastructure that allows someone to safely walk. It's really a design ethos stemming from our most traditional city and town making days as a civilization. So ultimately looking at how are places designed around the human and specifically the human foot. And so when we start to think of walkability then, that starts to bridge more into how are the buildings behaving in watching over the street to add to sense of security and place? \xa0Where can people gather and linger to add to our social tendency of humans and to create ultimately an environment for exchange of knowledge, goods, culture, services and so forth. And so, when we start to use the framework of walkable communities, it allows us as community members to have a discussion on are the streets performing that allow for people to easily walk. The first and last thing that we all do in using our communities is walk. Whether that's parking our car and then walking to our store or our home, walking down a main street, locking up our bicycle at the end of our trip. And so we have to start to bring back the human scale. So walkable communities are really putting the human back in the center of our city design."", ""KATY: In my mind I'm hearing you say all that and I'm such an analytics and assessment tool user, I can't imagine how you would go about measuring walkability. I would not dream of asking you to say how you assess it but what would be one or two quick ways so that people can get a quick sense of the analytics that would go into a walkability assessment. What would some of them be?"", ""SAMANTHA: When we start to look at a place - so using a specific example of you're on your main street, let's say for smaller towns - you can start to ask yourself what kind of edge is being created between the buildings and then the sidewalk and then the street. So when we think of high-quality edges in a highly walkable environment, you start to see things like, great shade trees or street trees, benches or other places to sit, an organization of the street furniture: Where is the signage? Where are the bicycle racks? How do you have a clear sidewalk/walk/talk zone, as we call it so that you can stroll side-by-side with a loved one. Your kids have that buffer from the sidewalk or the walking space or the street, so there's that sense of safety and security from the kind of human personal piece of it. And so where you start to see where the way an environment affects our behavior or our decision to walk is ultimately, if you have a road that may have a sidewalk but there's no buffer edge between the sidewalk or road - so there's no street trees. It's just an attached sidewalk. You'll often see less people walking because it's hotter, it's louder, it's less attractive, it's less inviting. \xa0And so a lot of the work that I've been doing is around how do we understand how the physical environment shapes the behavior and lifestyle choices that we are making. And sadly in too many places throughout America we've engineered natural movement out of our daily lives."", 'KATY: I do kind of ceremonial long walk 20-30-40 mile walk somewhat regularly with the 40 miles being for 40th birthdays and things and so I walked. We live in the same area as I understand it. At least on the same peninsula and I walked from my town in Sequim Washington up to Chimacum which has this beautiful trail system for most of it. \xa0But for a portion of it, a couple miles, I was on the freeway where at some places because the freeway doesn\'t have anything on the other side of the railing. It was just a drop off. My, I\'m gonna put air quotes around my ""walk"" was really me on the other side hanging on the side of the railing because there was only maybe 20 inches between the end of the car lane and the beginning of the railing. So it was absolutely not safe to walk on. So would I give that like a 1 out of a 10. Because I would say that the edge there is basically 18 inches between cars going 60 miles an hour and me. So I had to actually remove my body. There was actually no place to put my feet. I had my arms hanging and just kind of monkey\'d it down for a couple of miles. I had my feet kind of on berry vine growth. And there\'s a great picture because I had posted in the magazine article that came out, I\'m not sure that I would call this walkable. Yet it was the only way for me to get to my destination without a car.', 'SAMANTHA: Yeah, well exactly. That would have a zero to one. ', ""KATY: I was just wondering. So we would give that edge a zero to one. Ok great. \xa0I'm down with the scale now."", ""SAMANTHA: And you bring up another important point that streets and the speed of streets add to that quality of the environment too so the more that you have higher speeds on a road, the more separation you should have in creating the right level walking or bicycling environment. So obviously where we live on the peninsula there's a great trail system but there's also a huge gap in the trail system that creates that type of ease and access to destinations that people are trying to go along that network."", 'KATY: And it\'s interesting to me, so I have two young children who are now 5 and 7, who have been on this trail system. I imagine where many people live there are trails that might not be as extensive as ours, but even if you\'re in a park with a loop... we\'re familiar with walking on trails, sharing non-car areas with both walkers and cyclists. And one of the things I\'m interested in would be the difference between walkability and cycle-ability or bike-ability. Because I\'m finding that as more people are conscientious of getting out of cars and they want to go still on things that are fast and make sense for if they\'re using it for transport for to and from work or if they just enjoy going fast and their recreation is going 30-40 miles an hour, that I\'m finding that my children are still required to behave as cars in their quote ""walking space"" where they are limited to - they have to walk in a straight line, they have to know that you walk this direction on this side, versus that side. And it\'s kind of interesting where even though we\'re removing the cars, everyone still has to behave like they are a car or have this major driving knowledge. \xa0So I\'m finding that trails - in these certain areas - definitely if we go out in wilderness and if it\'s not mountain biking wilderness which we\'re also often sharing it with, that walkability is still being kind of pushed to behave for people on wheels who want to go fast. So I was just wondering, does bikeability have a completely separate rating as walkability or because you\'re limited to smaller allocations of space, you have to make both work?', ""SAMANTHA: Mm-hmm. \xa0Well I think that's where the art of context of a specific place and the balancing of needs and shared needs of users comes into place. \xa0And so, that's always difficult and not always perfect. So obviously when we think of trails, the different users, primarily being people on bikes and people walking, are going different speeds. And so what that often means is we need to think about making sure that we're building trails when and where we can wide enough so that then there's that opportunity for two people cycling to easily bike side by side and pass two people walking side by side, or two other people biking side by side. And so how do we kind of think about where we can put that added investment in and the beauty is that often when you're building a trail - let's say the kind of design standard is often 10 feet wide for a trail - but really the cost doesn't go up that much just to add another 2 feet which can make a really big difference when we think about wanting to have that mixing of users and types. And then also when we think about walkability and bike-ability answering your other question - is there a difference - we can start to rank the quality of the environments slightly different based on the user. But I think the fun thing for me when we think about walkability/bikeability is it's trying to achieve the same greater outcome which is obviously providing \xa0a transportation choice and valuing people who choose to walk and bike as highly or if not higher than people who choose to use their car to get places. But there's also a lot of added co-benefits when we think about environmental health, our social health, of course our physical health. But then also economic health. It's more sustainable and more affordable to build quality walking and biking human-scaled cities and towns. Versus what we have been doing for the last 60 years allowing our cities to be designed around the car. So it's kind of that cultural shift of thinking. And with that, while it sounds like you have a high tolerance to walk long distances, which is really awesome. I want to hear more about that because I, too, love walking. I would say for the average person we're trying to think about how do we create more compact life radiuses or circumferences of where we live and what we do know is that, on average - and this is true for small towns as well - 25% of the daily trips that we make are within a mile of our home or a 20 minute walk. And then 60% of our trips are within 3 miles of our home or about a 20 minute bike ride. So when we start to think about the tools together, the bike becomes a great extension to our ability to walk and still allows for an affordable choice in a transportation mode for people."", ""SAMANTHA: Exactly. Exactly. \xa0And I know you're getting ready to go to your European tour. It's so interesting when we think about where we as Americans like to travel and vacation to and Europe cities and towns are one of our key places that we like to go to. When you're there too. Obviously you'll be observing towns are built around the human foot. And we have this kind of nostalgia of we want to visit these places. We want to absorb that quality and \xa0yet we're still working on our own progression and transition to get there.. Where we are open to getting on trains the whole time while we're traveling and walking everywhere and things like that. So it's just kind of that cultural mentality too that its part of the science of how do you shift and create change within your own communities."", 'KATY: That\'s such a great point. You know everyone will say ""I barely walk ago but I go to Europe and I just walk all day long.” And a big reason for that is because it is safe and practical to do so. These cities are actually - they\'re built up for biking and cycling as a lifestyle.', 'SAMANTHA: Exactly.', ""KATY: \xa0Ok, so this is kind of a more fun question. \xa0What is one of, or a handful, of the least walkable areas you've assessed? What stands out in your mind about maybe one or two of these places?\xa0"", ""SAMANTHA: Yeah. Well the least walkable places ... I'll pick on a form of our towns ... is really ultimately \xa0the suburbs. And what that means from a design perspective is that we've overbuilt our roads. So it's more common in these locations to have three to four to five-lane roads. Sometimes even larger. \xa0And then I think what the suburbs do illustrate from missing the human scale, transportation, land use, connection is that buildings are often set far back from the road itself and often between the building and the road is off street parking so swaths of parking and asphalt. And so what we see in these environments is ultimately a very car driven design, which is not inviting for any human. There's no reason why you would want to walk in that environment. It's hostile. You know, if you are an elder or have other mobility issues good luck finding a place to rest and if you do find a place it's probably in the hot sun or in the elements of the weather based on your climate. And so what we have to start to think about as we want to transform cities and our suburban communities that are having a high demand of growth still because our cities across the country are continuing to grow. People are becoming more focused in more like urban-like environments, is how do you start to create the village-scale place. How do we kind of flip the transportation paradigm on its head? To understand the more that we create walking/bicycling/efficient transit options within communities the easier it will become for the motoring public. And so there's many different ways that you can start to create new policy, create new design standards and the toolkit's pretty large. So it's just a matter of developing that community will and that ground cover for political leaders to start to make some bigger changes. So I think that's the type of environment that, to me, is really, truly unwalkable and so hostile. And sadly you see people who have to walk in that environment. So when we start to think of that equity or justice piece, I think we really need to ask ourselves who are we leaving behind when we create places like that."", ""SAMANTHA:Yeah exactly. Well, I think the beauty of what we think about the walkable community is that one, part of it, especially when we're thinking about retrofitting or infilling our rural towns or more urban neighborhoods, is that a new process needs to be created so that truly community members can come together and share in the work of transforming their streets or alleyways or parks, plazas, whatever it might be. \xa0And to develop that ownership which then allows for the right mix of people within a community to be at the table. And so we are not forgetting or overlooking the needs of our different cultures, our different physical mobility needs and things like that. And when we think about walkability from an economic standpoint, it is the most affordable mode of transportation. I mean we all are given our two feet, or if we aren't able to walk we'll be able to find the assistance we need from wheelchairs or electric scooters and things like that. But if we're not creating those shared spaces to be able to depend on ourselves and our own mobility by design, then we're driving up the cost of living. It's always apparent in urban areas and rural communities - and in the urban areas specifically, traditional neighborhoods of communities of color and things like that that have been left out of the design, we see that these two kind of types of communities need to often own a car to get to work or to get to their grocery store, so we're not creating the right level of mixed uses and transportation choices to make a place affordable for people. So that's becoming a very big issue. And I think in the more urban settings we're definitely hearing this through the terms of gentrification or displacement and it's a big thing that we have to try to tackle as community numbers and get outside of the individual mindset and more of that community/tribal mindset and how we want our communities to thrive."", 'KATY: I\'ve got this little peace that I\'m going to read which is from a letter to the editor of the New Times which is a newspaper in Rwanda. And the original piece was about - I\'m paraphrasing - but essentially this idea that so many cars have taken over the town and that they needed an attitude adjustment about the importance of cars and this letter was saying: ""It is only the bourgeoisie, both high and low that lead totally sedentary lives and need a lifestyle change that requires an attitude change. \xa0Too many people believe you must be financially hard up when they encounter you on the road walking. I can\'t count how many times some would be good Samaritans have offered me lifts often insisting in my declining of those offers obviously in the belief I must have a serious problem if I am reduced to walking. For those with this kind of attitude, not walking has nothing to do with a lack of space, as in reality, Kigali has a lot for those who love to walk for pleasure especially early in the mornings before the sidewalks become clogged with foot traffic and car exhaust fumes. And the heat becomes increasingly unbearable."" \xa0So, Samantha, is walking a sign of poverty or of privilege? And do we need more walkable, bikeable, mobility-friendly infrastructures or do we need a cultural shift? Or both?', 'SAMANTHA: Great question. \xa0I would say we definitely need both. \xa0IT\'s a cultural shift to be able to get the infrastructure that we need and it\'s kind of that chicken or egg thing because the infrastructure will help create the cultural shift. So it\'s working in tandem in that regard. And I would say that\xa0 unfortunately in the US, I think in a lot of places walking has been a sign of poverty. And people who have to walk either by choice or because they can\'t afford to own a car or something like that are, to me we\'re sending a sign that we are treating those individuals as third class citizens. \xa0I was recently on a project in Florida where that quote really resonates to the environment that was created or that is created in many communities in Florida where when you see someone walking the perception is that they don\'t have the means to walk. But that\'s not always true. So we can\'t assume that and create those social stigmas. So immediately after I was in Florida I went to Copenhagen which is one of the world\'s biggest bicycling cities, and walking cities for that matter too, and you would never be able to guess who has ""privilege"" or more money than the person next to them. Because truly the environment and the infrastructure is prioritizing human efficiency, human travel. And it\'s a cultural norm there. And so we have to think about how we want to get there and ultimately by creating more choices in transportation we\'re allowing people more freedoms and more opportunity to be able to engage in their community in a more equal footing.', 'KATY: Beautiful. Yeah it\'s just being someone who almost exclusively walks for yes the health purposes of it and also because I do it as a way to constantly observe the walkability of what\'s around me. \xa0I think that it\'s really easy when you don\'t actually physically experiment with walking in your own spaces to think to perceive it to be more or less walkable than it really is. So I get out there and do it regularly and go ""yep, I\'d have to use a car to get here."" \xa0You know, like to really do that. But to recognize the fact that I\'m able to do it is because of a tremendous amount of privilege and time. Whereas someone can be taking that exact same talk and not have the choice to do so. So in the end it just really seems to come down to choice. \xa0Having to do it versus having multiple options. So I appreciate your feedback and your answer on that. And I guess finally... municipalities face all kinds of pressures: climate change, health of citizens, that might make them consider better ways to accommodate active modes of transportation. What will it take for active transportation, for natural human movement to move up the priority list for planners do you think?', ""SAMANTHA: Yeah. Well I would say the good news is that in a lot of places municipalities are understanding the transportation paradigm needs to be flipped on its head. We just can't afford to continue to build bigger, wider roads. We've proven that. So to further put the investments where we need to be heading really requires better synergy from citizens, so kind of that grassroots level and then the top down kind of decision making level within communities. I think the important thing that is easy to forget when you're frustrated with your city or the place where you're living and not putting the investments where you want is that ultimately decision makers hear a lot of needs. It's like you were say, climate change, health of citizens, we need to attract more buildings, we have a different economy whatever it might be, is how do you start to bring a common voice together as a place so that we can make better decisions together? \xa0And if we keep having kind of just separate ideas and lots of noise it's really hard for a decision maker to really put that financial backing into something that really is a change in paradigm as far as how we really planned our cities. I think the good news is that as communities come together and make the case for more walkable environments is what we do see is that it helps address the climate change issues. It helps to address public safety issues. And human health issues. And we know that by design walkable communities actually, in the long run, are more affordable and are the most sustainable way of building. An author who wrote "", "" ,Jeff Speck is the author, he put in there that a walkable community is actually more sustainable than everyone changing their light bulbs to the environmentally friendly ones because what we're doing is we're better using our land. And we're giving people the choices not to use their cars. Become car light. \xa0And then also by getting the green parks, the open spaces, the lungs of a built environment, we're able to better address how our water filters back into the waterways and things like that. So it's a very holistic approach. But you're right, we have to change where we're willing to put our investments. Definitely in America we are not financially at burden. We have more money than we know what to do with. It's really do our cities and towns have the political will to be making change in the way we invest in our design of our communities."", 'KATY: Wow. Amazing. Well I guess if someone is taking the responsibility of helping cities become more walkable then I will continue the assuming some of the responsibility of helping others become more comfortable in their own bodies so they can walk and thus participate outside in their communities in these open, walkable spaces and movable spaces. So thank you Samantha for coming on to speak with me about walkability. \xa0Samantha Thomas is a Built Environmentalist, civic thinker and strategist. Helping communities create solutions that enhance walkability, well being and healthier places for all. You can connect with her at ', '. \xa0Samantha, thanks so much.', 'SAMANTHA: Thank you. I enjoyed this.', ""MARIA: Hi thank you so much for having this conversation with me. I'm really excited to talk to you about my work with my organization Multicultural Communities for Mobility and what I'm doing as a scholar in both Portland and Los Angeles to do this work with our communities."", 'KATY: Yeah. I am always grateful that people will come on the show because I feel like people are doing very important work in the world so I appreciate you stepping away from serving much bigger needs than being on this podcast. All listeners appreciate being informed so hopefully it will motivate others to take action or at least expand their worldview. So before we get too far along a path, I want to set up some basic definitions. So first, how would you explain mobility justice? And how did you get interested in that?', ""MARIA: \xa0\xa0Sure. I'm glad you asked. I always want to make this work relatable and it's so important that we translate these heavy and complex issues in a way that people can understand so that they can see themselves in this work and maybe be inspired to make a change somehow or to have a little bit more empathy for people who are experiencing it. And mobility justice is still, I think, a term that we are trying to define and people define it in their own way. I would say that my peers at "", "" are taking the lead in that and we are defining mobility justice as both an outcome and an approach that we are taking to address inequities in our community specifically around transportation issues. But it's beyond that. It really is about getting to zero deaths in our community in terms of traffic injuries and traffic fatalities and making sure that people are not getting harmed out there whether they're biking, walking, jogging, strolling, rolling, or driving a car. And mobility justice is also about making sure we are validating people's identities and embracing them and allowing them to have the kind of healthy and productive life that they deserve without the negative impacts of racism and all these systemic issues that people experience when they are simply moving about their communities. So mobility justice is incredibly loaded and heavy and our work really is about trying to make this more real for people as an outcome where we live, but for the doers and action makers out there, how can we help them take part in this so that they can make their communities better in terms of making mobility justice a reality."", 'KATY: How did you get interested in it?', ""MARIA: Well I think my journey goes back to life in Los Angeles. I was raised in Los Angeles and I know that over time as I was growing up walking and biking in my community was not something that my parents or grandparents wanted for me anymore. It's something that we depended on in our community just to get to school or places that were important to us and I think over time we started to realize there are all these safety issues that we are concerned with. I know particularly for my parents who were concerned about a young woman navigating her neighborhood on foot and as you got older that's something that parents don't necessarily want their kids to do. And I know not many people have the luxury to take other modes besides walking. Walking is essential to people's lives. And we know now as we are exploring this as scholars, that communities have tremendous issues - especially communities of color - when it comes to navigating their neighborhoods. And I think for me it was just a personal passion to be able to make communities more bikeable and walkable. And it's not that simple. \xa0And I discovered that it's not just about promoting people to walk and bike and to enjoy these communities but to understand what different people experience when they do that every day. And so I volunteer for "", "". I've been doing that for 5 years now and they really have helped me understand more deeply what many communities and cultures and racial and ethnic groups are experiencing in their respective neighborhoods in terms of mobility justice. And I began as a bike safety instructor to really get into this work. And I realized quickly that it's not just about improving people's skill sets to ride a bike, but it's trying to improve the environment that they're biking in. That makes that experience better for them."", 'KATY: I\'ve seen walkability as a social science measure come up in various public health and other social science investigations that are now starting to look at city design, urban planning, health in blue zones, this idea that the walkability of a city would relate to the health of the people that lived there. \xa0And there are a lot of definitions. This is so new. There is going to be a lot of malleability in definitions. I\'m going to link to a piece put out by Harvard University called ""', '"" that compares many different definitions, but Maria, how do you define walkability or understand walkability?', ""MARIA: \xa0I'm glad we're getting to this. I think walkability is another loaded word. I think we'll have to provide to our listeners here an entire reading list or definition list because we're talking about things like mobility justice and walkability and these really just started to emerge. But in this context MCM is really working to expand how we understand walkability. \xa0For real estate professionals they talk about walkability in terms of scores in a neighborhood. And how easy it is to get to a grocery store, a library, the laundromat, a bar, and all these things are essential to people's lives. But when you're doing mobility justice work and you're really trying to put on all these lenses so that you don't miss someone and their experience we are defining walkability in a lot of other ways and we are thinking about enjoyment and safety and acceptance and affirmation and all types of other things that are really hard to articulate. For example, we often bring in the experiences of young people of color and this is something that we should talk even more about and it's something in the news all the time but are we really listening? \xa0If you imagine a young black person. A young black man or let's say a black child. Let's just get it down to that. A black child walking in a neighborhood. What does walkability mean for this child. You know? Walkability for many of us means that this child is able to go back home to his mother and for his mother walkability means that he can go around his neighborhood without getting stopped by police being asked why he's out late or not being stopped by a neighbor being asked why he is walking past his house. And that this child is also able to get to school on time and without the fear and the trauma of everything that he might come across as he's trying to get to school. So I think walkability really means are we able to ensure that someone's quality of life, especially a person of color, can be the same as someone else's when we're navigating the street. And so an urban planner, like me, that's extremely important to think about. Because for decades or for the entire history of our field, for example, we might have been a lot more focused on constructing a built environment that had the right balance of concrete and greenery and parking spaces and housing. And all of these really important features of the neighborhood. However there are so many other layers that we have to be more conscious of as we have this elite privilege to construct our streets and our neighborhoods. Through codes, through policies, through architecture, design and engineering. So walkability really takes into consideration the built environment, the cultural environment, and social environments that all impact how we walk. And it's sometimes the invisible things. Is it like a woman who was walking at night and how often does she have to check behind her shoulder out of fear that she might be crossing the wrong path or place. And walkability is being able to choose any street to get to where you want to go without fear that something is going to affect your safety or your well being. So all of these things are walkability and the things that we should consider."", ""KATY: Thank you for expanding that idea. So I'm thinking right now of the next 50 questions that could branch out off of that. \xa0But I think that my next reflexive question is, I feel like human nature and maybe it's not all humans but certainly the nature of engineers and designers and planners is that I can relate most to the woman looking over her shoulder as she's moving forward in a dark city as I'm trying to get from point a to point b. So yes, it's walkable. There's a place for my feet to go. There's a place for my feet to go that is not also where cars are going and there's a path between where I'm staying and where I want to go. But is that something through urban design, meaning that there's features of lights and cameras and other technologies that give us a sense of security or is this design in that trying to refashion the behavior of everyone who is occupying all of the spaces that we're going to move through. So you are occupying two roles. You've got a foot in city planning and design which I imagine is the greenery that you're planting and where it goes and how much light's coming through and what you're going to put beneath the feet that are going to be walking or moving through that space. But for your program, I'm thinking of your scholastic work, are there concrete things you fashion or is this about fashioning ideas and bringing about change through influencing the behavior of the people basically that you're going to be sharing the space with."", ""MARIA: It's all of those things and I'll break it down for you here. Urban design is one aspect of it. I think it's an aspect of it that people have been able to grasp a lot better because it's something that people can see and construct. But there are a lot of things when it comes to designing cities that are beyond what we measure with a ruler or what we calculate so, for example, it's beyond behavior, but you know I think behavior is a big part of it. It's behavior and perceptions. We are working as urban designers, urban planners, to influence our colleagues. Especially people who have been in this field for generations or decades. They've just been doing this a long time and they haven't made the shift in their mind that it's beyond the street. So it really is about talking about this stuff in a way that can help people shift their perceptions so that they can pass policies and change how they do this work and really continue to make that shift that we need so desperately so that our end goal of fewer traffic injuries and deaths but also fewer harassments on the street and fewer assaults and racially charged crimes. All of these things fall in the responsibility of urban planners, elected officials, police officers, and everybody who participates in cities. And even neighbors. Everybody has a role in this. But I think we're really looking for those in power who can influence this change. And I also want to include public health. Because I am a public health professional. I am really trying to bring in to the spaces that we work in a lot more awareness around disabilities and abilities, cognitive and physical. You know I talked about the black boy walking to school and the woman walking in the dark but what about someone with a mobility device and how are we really catering to people who have to use a wheelchair or a walker or has poor depth perception or blindness. I think we are failing many people here on that note. But it's interesting to see that in cities we can better implement 88 guidelines and we know how to design for that but people don't know how to design to make cities better for different cultures, races, and ethnicities. So mobility justice, as I'm trying to articulate it and trying to do this work with my colleagues at "", "" is that we are trying to bring about this understanding to include a abilities, disabilities but also ways that people of different races and ethnicities are disadvantaged. And so, that's something that I am extremely passionate about in terms of the civil rights act of 1964 and how I, as a planner, can continue to make it real for people through my professional work. And that is continuing to take into account the experiences of people with limited English proficiency, people in racial and ethnic minorities, and people with low income and also to add to that of course, people with cognitive and physical disabilities. Which isn't included often in a lot of other areas but combining all of those things will help us reach mobility justice and have the walkability and bikeability that we desire but overall liveability. You know? That we're creating communities where people can be themselves fully. Where people can be successful and happy and healthy. And I think we have a tremendous role as urban planners to facilitate that. We might not be the ones engineering the streets but we are the facilitators, those mediators, and those thought provokers. So I have a tremendous privilege to keep making that happen."", ""MARIA: Sure. Let's talk about all kinds of things that could improve people's experiences in the whole mobility justice umbrella. One of the things I would love to mention and talk about is addressing defensive design. And getting rid of benches and surfaces that discourage people who are houseless from sleeping or resting there. \xa0We've all seen this in some way shape or form. We've seen benches that have unusual armrests to keep people from laying down on it. Uncomfortably angled benches in subway stations or in other spaces where you think it's about efficient space but it's more about deterring people from spending time there. So that's mobility justice. It's getting rid of that kind of design and making spaces just more equitable for people who may not have a place to sleep or rest and just need to spend time somewhere. Another design feature that was extremely important are curb ramps and ADA accessibility and trying to create safer surfaces for people to move about. Widening sidewalks whenever possible. Although expensive it's such a good investment, not just in urban areas but in rural areas to encourage walking. There are also protected bike lanes and going beyond just putting paint on the ground but creating a separate surface so that somebody can walk or bike or use their wheelchair in that protected lane. We are also talking about high-level mobility justice and transportation equity improvements such as establishing an equity and justice office in the transportation department and ensuring that there are enough staff people present to continue to ensure that we are meeting these guidelines or creating new guidelines to adhere to to make places more equitable and welcoming. So there's all kinds of things in between from high level policies to design but overall it really is about how are we redirecting our resources so that we are investing in the movement of people when they're walking, biking, and using transit. And this is a highly politically charged conversation too that people will get into. Whether they support walking or biking or not but highway space and highway investments are something that we should be talking about more. And how we invest in our infrastructure tells a lot about our priorities as a government and as communities. If we are putting all of our billions of dollars in widening highways and removing homes and removing space and green space for highways, that really shows us where our priorities are and unfortunately that is not a climate sustainable future and it is taking away from resources that ensure that people can walk and bike and be more active and have that healthier life."", ""KATY: Ok, I'm gonna switch gears a little bit. It's a long that topic but I feel I want to bring in this other piece."", 'MARIA: Sure.', ""KATY: I would say that I grew up walking around from place to place but was walking around with all of the migrant farm worker who were also walking from place to place because not everyone had cars. So it's quite normal for me to have many people walking around on foot for different reasons. So now I'm kind of living in this fitness, health, natural movement space, where there is the idea that we have extra time to exercise and walk and we don't have to be at work for 12 hours a day or we didn't spend all day using our bodies doing back breaking work so now we want to go for a long walk and we have a choice to walk because I also have a car, so it's always a choice for me so it seems like a privilege to walk, but at the same time, it is also seen as a sign of poverty. So I'd like to know your thoughts. Is walking a sign of poverty or privilege? from either your perspective or the perspective of mobility justice and just considering mobility and urban design as the whole."", ""MARIA: I'm glad we're talking about that. And I think it really depends on the context and the neighborhood that you live in in places along the coast in more affluent neighborhoods, for example, walking for leisure could be a sign of privilege because in some neighborhoods people can have a joyful, uninterrupted, 2 mile walk just by stepping foot out of their house only a few, maybe a few blocks. And they can really enjoy the environment and the nature and have those mental health benefits from walking. But in places walking is their only mode of travel because they can't afford a car. They cannot qualify to get a driver's license because they may be undocumented or not have the physical ability to drive. So walking is the only way. And in many ways that could be seen as a huge disadvantage. And there are a lot of inequities there. But it really depends on the context and where you live. But ultimately mobility justice isn't about faulting people for the choice that they make and what modes they take or what modes they have to take. It really is about creating \xa0the environment both built and cultural so that people can make all those choices and have the choices and have healthy outcomes. It becomes a privilege to walk if someone else who has a different identity does that same walk for example where you are walking but they are interrupted by police violence, they are interrupted by sexual harassment, or other types of assaults on their being. And so that's where we really have to think deeply about how we can start to shift the way we design our cities and the way we make policies and how we are creating unity in the places that we live in so that people can have these shared experiences rather than the ones that polarize or divide them."", ""MARIA: No everyone has a role in this and people ask that all the time so I'm glad you're asking that. I think we can make some very conscious choices and actions to continue putting our support in communities and in our neighborhoods so that people who are not like us, for example, or people who don't have the privilege we have to enjoy those spaces. And I think there are a lot of things that we think about on a personal level like welcoming people and sharing public spaces, interacting and talking to people. For example if a woman is at a bus stop and I'm a woman and I'm standing there with her, I'll greet her and say hello and make her feel less isolated in that space, if I feel like it's something that I can do to help make that late night bus wait less awful. And I know I appreciate it too when people strike up conversations with me that are friendly and harmless. And it does make a difference. There's also things that we can do in our homes. We can vote a certain way to continue to vote for policies and resources that can make lives better for marginalized and underrepresented groups. That we continue to make immigrant friendly spaces and policies that we continue to invest in the success of black children. That we support schools that are struggling. All of these things can be done by regular people who are not urban planners or elected officials so there are a lot of conscious choices we can make to make spaces more welcoming. But it really comes down to our day to day decisions. How we spend our resources. Where we spend our resources. I also like to tell people to support small businesses owned by people of color. So if there's a Latino market, go ahead and build relationships there and greet people and keep coming back and find out what's important to them and what is affecting their business and their well being and their livelihood. And just strike up those conversations and be a genuine ally. Someone who is authentic interested in what they're going through."", 'KATY: Are you seeing cities and towns considering mobility justice in their development decisions more and more often.', ""MARIA: In little ways they are. \xa0I think most bureaucracies and large agencies are doing this work in terms of transportation equity. That's a lot more accessible for them. That's language they can understand. But we are working as an organization to continue to partner with these agencies in large cities and small towns to help them create action plans and to consult with them on how to make this real. So we can go from brainstorms to things happening in the community that will actually make a change. So mobility justice is a little bit more of an uphill battle in some places but we are doing this work now and we encourage people to continue to follow us. "", "" is undergoing a rebrand right now. We're trying to reconceptualize our identity as an organization and how we continue to do mobility justice moving forward. So we are changing our name to People for Mobility Justice. And this is the first media outlet where I'm sharing that so I'm excited that."", 'KATY: Thank you for sharing it here first.', ""MARIA: This is very new and we've been doing this work for almost a decade but it really is finally now coming to fruition that we are getting a lot better about speaking about mobility justice and mobilizing our communities and hiring staff people and making sure that we can help cities and community members and all types of people who are interested in this find their stake in it and help them become more effective in this work. So we're really excited to be People for Mobility Justice and find ways to partner with all types of people who just want to improve their communities and build solidarity and unity in ways that they haven't before. And doing that through transportation and streets is an excellent way to do that. I think there's a lot we can do with how people experience riding the bus or train. How people bike and how people walk. Even how people secure housing and all these other things. So we're excited to expand on our work and to bring more people in."", ""KATY: For people who don't really delve into any local politics within the communities that they live in, if they go to their city or township website, is it listed on everyone's city website - their transportation meetings, policies they're considering changing? Where can people go, I mean understanding that every single city is going to be different and has a different website but in general is this pretty accessible information for people who make up the city?"", ""MARIA: No. \xa0I think cities are terrible at finding ways to make this a lot more accessible to people. There are efforts, obviously, to translate materials and to create public meetings in central areas but overall these meetings are really hard to participate in. This language is heavy. This is a lot to talk about. And the agendas don't always look welcoming. And if people are invited to go they might only get to talk for a minute or two and most people need more than that. So, it's something that is listed in most municipalities. There is a standing meeting for either land use and planning or transportation and there are topics around biking, walking and transit and these spaces. But I do ask that if people do want to participate they should continue to start listening more and to listen to marginalized and underrepresented groups. People of color. Black communities. Women of color. People with disabilities. Immigrant communities. To listen and really understand what's happening and you'll find that mobility justice work is not just about biking, walking, and transit. It's ensuring affordable housing. It's ensuring that people can age in place - that they don't have to get displaced once they stop earning a large income and that they can continue to live there as they grow old. It's about making sure we're building enough housing and not stopping developments that create affordable housing. It's making sure that people have access to education from Kindergarten all the way to when they're 100 years old. It's all of these things. And as we talk about it more, all of it is mobility justice, really, and creating that kind of unified community that really is the real livable and walkable place that we want."", ""KATY: Well thank you again for taking your precious time away from much more important things and being on my show. I appreciate you coming on and hopefully turning on some light bulbs in people's minds."", 'MARIA: \xa0Thank you so much and stay tuned for People for Mobility Justice and feel free to reach out to me if you need to have these conversations or you want to tackle this where you live.', ""KATY: All right. I'll make sure that we have all the information to contact Maria in our show notes. Maria thank you for being my guest."", 'MARIA: Thank you.

She's working with colleagues at Portland State University to develop a framework to provide transportation investments, the only academic health center in Oregon and the largest employer in Portland to make walking biking and transit use the best way to get to this health care campus. We'll put some links to some of her work in our show notes in case you want to learn more."", "" 1. How much water to take in mid-summer? Good question. \xa0It's going to be very relative to where you are. Big difference between Phoenix and summer in the pacific northwest. So maybe talk to people who are out doing long events in that area. There's usually someone who's in charge of marathon training in the area. There's maybe someone at your local fitness center who can answer that for you. So you definitely want to have enough water to be safe. On the other hand I had "", "" I had done a couple weeks before and I noted that I will often try to do a 20 miler where I focus on not being so comfortable while I'm doing it so I'll take minimal food, if any at all, and then again one bottle of water. And I'm not backpacking where there's no chance of me getting water. I'm always really close to, within a quarter mile, or a half mile of a house so in an emergency would always have access to water, but just to kind of keep myself challenged. So again, you're gonna figure out what that value is for you based on your summer temperatures. Question 2. Backpack or messenger bag? \xa0Messenger bag is my preferred although my messenger bag is really this long strapped over the shoulder completely cloth bag that has no edges or lumpy straps or anything that pokes into me and I can easily swap it from one side to the other. It has a great volume. The whole thing wads up and I can hold it in my hand but I can fill it with maybe 4 towels and a lunch. So the volume of it is pretty significant. But I lost it in New Zealand. But that was my favorite walking bag. But when I do go and want to take some stuff with me I use actually a kid's backpack. One of my kids' backpacks. There just a little bit smaller and again I don't' like to take a lot of bulk with me. It's not necessary. I don't feel like I'm running a marathon or anything like that. \xa0So tiny backpack is what I've been using as of late. And if anyone in New Zealand found my bag please send it asap. 3) One pair of shoes or several options? So I have found through trial and error one pair of shoe that works really well for me. You can see my rationale in this in a "", "" a few years back when I did my first I think it was a 36 mile walk. And I struggled with the shoe thing. So I've got this, I'm in the pacific northwest, and so walking in wet shoes doesn't really work well for long distance as far as skin goes and skin friction. So I have a Vivo Barefoot tennis shoe that's really thin and light and flexible but it is their waterproof version so that works well. \xa0And then obviously for shorter distances and it's about a speed thing for me. When I'm going long distance like this I'm usually without my family which I usually am with them so I am moving pretty quickly. If I'm just going on a long slower paced backpacking, if I'm doing 11 miles or 12 miles but I'm giving myself an hour a mile, then I'll just wear my minimal sandals actually. So it's again a personal thing. It depends on the state of training which you're used to but I try not to figure out what shoe I'm gonna wear on a 20 mile walk on an actual 20 mile walk. That's established through doing lots of 5s and 7s and 10 mile walks. Maybe even a 12-er. 4) What foot/body prep do you do? \xa0I do a lot of the correctives from "", 'and ', "". My ankle and my first big big walk that I did, it was my left ankle that - it's amazing you'll have this tiny area in your body that will make it so that your whole body cannot take another step. And I knew about that ankle. I had just never ever asked it to walk all of the steps for 36 miles before. \xa0So it's interesting the thing that bothers you a little bit when you only move a little bit can turn into the thing that bothers you a lot when you move a lot. So after that walk, after that walk whereby the time I got to mile 12 or maybe it was mile 18, that ankle or that foot would have happily just put it up on a couch, but it was dragged along with all the other parts. So it was really kind of burnt in my mind \xa0- if you want to be someone who's got this really large volume that you're doing you need to address it with more regularity and more gusto. So my favorite exercise for my ankle, the one that was a game changer for me ... and this was when I had a foundation of all the kind of baseline correctives was sitting on the floor, with my legs tucked behind me, so sitting on your shins with your knees folded all the way back but then tuck your toes under. So instead of being on the top of your foot you've got your toes tucked under. And then sitting your weight back on your heels. And it was a yowsa at first and has been for a long time but I just do it with consistency and I really watch the position of my knees and my ankles and my shins and \xa0haven't had an issue with my ankle ever since. And I've logged quite a few - many many miles but I've got six or seven long distance like 20+ milers on it and it's never been an issue as it was the first time. So take care of your feet. Question #5, Will I be able to get back to my routine the next day or should I plan a full day of rest. The end. Good question, like I said, my ankle, when I had had it made it so walking the rest of the day when I had stopped and even the next day I was hobbling around a little bit.But I've done 20 milers before where as soon as I'm done I can feel it in my hips and my knees and I won't be doing any more mileage that day. I sleep really well. The next day when my feet first kind of bear their weight on their first few steps, I can definitely feel that I've done something but usually after 20 minutes of walking and doing all my regular stuff, I don't feel it anymore. But again that's me at this stage. \xa0I've led a lot of people through these longer distance walks. If you've ever come out for a retreat where the second day is a 20 mile walk, again it's the ankle or that hip for many people where they're tending to it the next day. And I spent a good hunk of time tending to that ankle. It was never what I would consider injured. I never had to do any injury prevention. I just really ramped up the corrective exercise for it and got it moving. Because my daily life wouldn't move it the way that I needed to after I had just banged how many steps makes up 30+ miles. So anyway, that was super fun, Noga. Thank you for asking. Thank you for "", ""which I'm going to take with me on another 20 miler I'm doing tomorrow. That's two in one month. Boom. First time I've ever done that, so that was a milestone for me. My next milestone (don't tell anyone) is three 20 milers either in a week or three 20 milers in three consecutive days. Not sure when it's going to happen. Maybe I'll save it for my 60th birthday. In addition to thanking "", ' thank you to the rest of the Dynamic Collective who have been sponsoring this series.

I can spend the whole day out in the garden reading or working or pulling weeds or staring.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah. \xa0And then the beach. The beach is kind of my spiritual home I think.', ""KATY: I grew up on the beach but I don't have one here. \xa0I never had the mountains before, though, so I have turned into a mountain person."", 'STEPHANIE: Nice!', ""KATY: Isn't that funny to convert?

I don't think I have, I'm normally such an achievement driven person, I would say. I like to create new things or complete tasks. But I am not, like I don't have, with the exception of second grade where we got a little construction paper small book for every 25 pages that we would read in the summer. I think that was the last summer reading goal I had. Which was, you know, to gather as many of those little books as possible so I could be obnoxious and staple them halfway across the room when I came back in. \xa0But other than that, no. \xa0I've actually been even reading hardly at all. \xa0I have read Animal, Vegetable, Miracle."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Oh yes. The Barbara Kingsolver book.', 'KATY: I read books maybe once a year.', ""STEPHANIE: Yeah, it's a good one."", 'KATY: And I\'ve been meandering through that but really I\'ve just been taking a break. \xa0I mean I\'ve been working a lot but I\'ve been taking a break from having really to do anything. So very few books. I think I\'m kind of doing the reading all books like they\'re short story books. Like, ""oh I\'ll just read two pages of this"" and then set it down. I always have 4 or 5 - I\'ve always had 4 or 5 books going at a time where I just read two or three paragraphs or 2 or 3 pages of one. And then I think, because I do that, maybe that\'s how I connect a lot of different ideas. Because I don\'t really dive into one. I kind of get a smidge of one, and something else and then ""This is amazing! \xa0There are two books written 100 years apart or on the other side of the planet by people with completely different backgrounds and they\'re saying the same things."" \xa0So that\'s my style for summer reading and it\'s kind of my style... I\'m like going to the garden but I\'m like spending 2 minutes on my peas and then I pluck a couple of weeds over here... like meandering. I don\'t know what meandering and doing three percent of a task before you switch to another task... I don\'t know what that\'s called but that is what my summer has been like so far.', 'STEPHANIE: It sounds heavenly. It sounds like an old-fashioned childhood kind of summer where you just kind of follow your nose.', 'KATY: Yeah. And I didn\'t have that kind of childhood. I had a go to work non-childhood childhood. \xa0And so that might be where I am right now in this, ""I\'m just gonna lay on this blanket under this tree and see what shadow pictures the leaves make.""

And I don\'t think that...it\'s like PR, it isn\'t something that just happens and you sit there and go, ""Oh that was great."" It creates way more work than you were planning. You\'re like, ""Ok this book will come out and I\'ll kind of meander through PR"" and it\'s like, no, it\'s like you\'re flying twice across the United States and a lot of emails ... it created quite a bit of work. And then the demand of what happens when you sell all those books is then you have to print more books and those are all operational transactions. Updating and oh... it was an intense... it hasn\'t even been that long. That book feels - it has not been out very long but that book feels like it\'s been out for years.', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', ""KATY: Just because of the amount of work was kind of pressed right into the first 90 days that it came out.

So I'm glad we're gonna talk about it."", ""KATY: Well, it's kind of like my other book "", "" where it's a book written for a large population of people where no other book really has existed before. \xa0You know, "", ', I mean there are certainly books written, like senior fitness books. Like there are certainly some of those books. And we know this because we were looking at cover samples.', 'STEPHANIE: We did lots of research.', ""KATY: How to do a cover design. And the pictures are all the same. Doesn't matter if the book was printed 5 years ago or 25 years ago. The cover is the same. It's like older adults in like 80s workout wear. I mean I think we actually saw headbands on a lot of people and like holding 3-pound weights. One person was always sitting in a chair. Like there was just this kind of familiar messaging. And so I think "", ' 1) it wasn\'t that tired stereotype of a book and 2) the message was really different. I think instead of saying, ""Hey, seniors, would you like to keep exercising? Here are some modified exercises."" \xa0It was like, ""Hey everybody, we\'re all getting older. All of us are aging. How does this whole... "" We\'re a sedentary culture, how does that message look when you get 50 or 60 or 70 and what if the things that we attribute to aging, the inevitable decline in our body as a result of our chronological age, what if it\'s not that all. What if we are simply looking at how a sedentary population ages out. And how would someone who is 60 or 70 or 80 or 90 be able to take the messaging that\'s in ', ' or ', ' or ', '? How would they, given that those messages are for everybody, what kind of considerations would you need to hold or have before you started working on these same things that maybe your 20-year-old grandchild who is also a college level athlete, they brought home this book and it was like, ""This is amazing.""? \xa0And you\'re like ""Great I would love to do that but I\'m too old."" \xa0This book was really written to be shared up and shared down and shared wide by people who are coming in through one of those other key portals and say, ""She\'s tailored this message and the exercises and the environment just for you in a way that..."" and here\'s what makes it different, ""in the way that other people have already done and you can see what it looks like 10 years later."" \xa0Which, none of the other books have. None of the other books have such in depth testimonials of someone who you would think could not do the things that I\'m about to suggest that you do and share their journeys, their narratives. So that\'s what makes it different is you will be escorted. So that the person who gets the book will be escorted through other people\'s experiences. It\'s not as instructional as my other books. \xa0Or, not only instructional. It\'s also... I mean is it a narrative? You know literature more than I do. I mean it\'s someone\'s journey. Memoir? Is it a movement memoir almost?', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0It definitely has elements of movement memoir, I would say thanks to your four co-authors who are all in their 70s. One is 80 now. She turned 80 as the book was being published. And so their stories along side, I would say, definitely give it that narrative memoir flair, we'll say, in addition to the exercise programs and any information about, you know, what more movement might look like in a life that maybe hasn't had much."", 'KATY: Right. And also they\'re giving movement instructions. I mean these women have gone through our certification program and are now teaching their peers from a position of ""I took this training"" like they are passing on this information and teaching movement classes. And so they have unique perspectives on the exercises that I cannot have because my experience doesn\'t afford me that perspective yet. I mean I can put myself in many different people\'s shoes, which you do when you\'re writing an exercise book. Like you would call it a modification: what would someone who\'s pregnant do or what would someone. But until you\'ve actually been in those physiological states you cannot embody their full experience. So we just let them, like, ""well how would you teach this exercise?"" ""Well, we teach it like this because X, Y and Z"". So that stuff I think is priceless, you know, that you are getting.', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', 'KATY: You are getting their perspectives in addition to mine which makes it extremely robust, I think.', ""KATY: Yeah. That was, it was a study done at Stanford. So it was, I think the way the study went, the experiment was set up like this; they had they're filming people walking in and out of the experiment space. And so from that video, you can analyze people's gaits really from everything. I mean we're analyzing, not we but, gaits are being analyzed from satellites to identify different people at this point. That's how unique your gait is to you, that it tells a lot about your history. Anyway, they would have these groups of people and if I recall they are the groups that they were measuring were 62 to 86. So that's the group that they were having come in and play these video games. 30 minutes of video games and they would monitor how they walked in and then how they left. \xa0They would measure their gait. And they had two groups. And one group was given subliminal messaging where like the words are just flashed beyond really your perception and imbedded within the exact same video game, the messages were either senile, elderly, fragile, dangerous, you know these kind of words reinforcing the stereotypes. So they were reinforcing the aging stereotype that you were to be worried. You are frail. You are old. And then in the other video game, they embedded words like strong, balanced, agile, wise, astute, you know like they were, they took I think the positive and negative word for each kind of concept. And so the idea was if we negatively reinforce this aging stereotype, how do people behave physically after that. And they found that in the group where they were reinforcing the positive attributes and saying you are actually strong, you are balanced, that when they left, their gait was changed to be more stable. To be more balanced. And they used that by monitoring the swing phase which is how long it takes really between steps. And so people were taking longer steps and they could find that correlation just simply between word choices. And I put it right up front. And it was like there has been so much thought into the word choices. I mean beyond just communicating an idea well, which every author is doing. I mean the idea that you will not see the word senior, elderly, and I put that in the front. I said these women, they have removed these words from their vocabulary. When we talked about writing this book, they're like here's the book that we want to read as this group. We don't want another book written to us saying silver and old and so we had to come up with a term though because you are referring to a group that is regularly researched and so we came up with goldener. \xa0And I've done a couple interviews which we can maybe even link to in the show notes."", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', 'KATY: \xa0Where, like the California Department of Aging, I\'m not sure if that\'s their exact title but people who are monitoring for this population, this goldener population, laws that are coming out that influence them, they interviewed me on this book and he\'s like, ""I really think that goldener might be the word of the future."" Without realizing it everything kind of in our government structure language wise is reinforcing frail, old, outdated. Like we don\'t have any sort of celebration. And so language, to me, that\'s also a very powerful part of this book because it means that if that other literature is to be expanded or applicable beyond that one experiment, we\'ve filled a book full of reinforcing just how capable you are or are about to become. You know we\'ve used a lot of messaging. You know there\'s not like, ""Pick up everything in \xa0your house because it might hurt you."" You know, warning warning warning. And understanding that there\'s a cautiousness or an alertness that you develop through moving more but that\'s different than being afraid and perpetuating fear. And so ', ', to me, is a very positive, ""You have got this. You are right on your normal biological pathway for a human. We are all aging together. Here are just some things that you can start doing for more robusticity."" \xa0So I like the positive, positivity of ', '. I think that that is also part of what makes it stand out as a book for the goldener population.', ""STEPHANIE: For me, there's a resonance with "", ' and ', ' that we talked about last time which is; our bodies are capable of amazing feats if our minds agree to cooperate.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: Oh yeah. I mean ', "" is about changing your mind. I mean your mind changes first. It's about shifting paradigms almost a little bit in how much more movement. I mean not just the paradigm of exercise less move more. But this idea that you are not, the decline that you're seeing isn't about your age. Like it is not this inevitable piece that we've kind of been led to believe simply through language or how questions are, like how studies are phrased. Again, the language choice of a study... it's very difficult to delineate between age and between years that you've had a habit. And I think there was a study that came out, I don't know, about 2 or 3 years ago about bunions and that bunions are, I can't remember exactly the title of it but it was on Twitter. Everything's on Twitter. It was something like studies show that bunions are increased with your age."", 'STEPHANIE: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: And then they had all these things spun off like you would expect to see them in older populations because it\'s something that goes hand in hand with aging. And I piped in with my 140 characters or whatever saying that how you phrase it right now isn\'t doing a good job of delineating between years of habit and how old someone is. How long, like what are the shoe wearing and the gait habits of these people and for how many years. Which are almost impossible to gather. Like you can\'t, it would be very challenging to interview someone and have them accurately provide a recount of how many steps they took and in what shoes and for how many years and what were the models. \xa0Like you can\'t actually do the rigorous work of determining geometry but everyone can get their age right. So we keep going to these simple measures and then we come up with these headlines and then slowly we create a culture that just expects failure. Physical failure to be happening. And in fact, you know, it\'s fine that it\'s happening. So it\'s almost like, to me, it\'s like a continuous disempowerment through the difficulty of breaking down what\'s actually happening and so we just go to this kind of easy to publish stuff that then, what do you end up with? You get a bunch of people who say, ""I\'m old. I have bunions. I\'m right on track. The science says that I\'m gonna have this."" ', ""STEPHANIE: There's nothing I can do about this."", 'KATY: Right. And so, yes, the language is to change your mind to say, ""We don\'t really know what\'s age and what\'s length of habit. But because you don\'t know it\'s equally either one of those. It\'s not mostly going to be age simply because someone chose those words to put in the study."" \xa0It\'s equally open to either. And here\'s what we know about physiology and here\'s what we know from other studies about how people can adapt and change. So why don\'t you just do these moves here and then start seeing how that\'s working for you. A little bit more empowering and to help get over that hump of because we do have this kind of sedentary nature to help override, like if you\'re interested in data... why don\'t you start collecting data on yourself. Why don\'t you see what your feet are doing? Have you never stretched your toes? Why don\'t you try that right now? Oh, you can do in two minutes something that you couldn\'t do before? Ok. Now we\'re in a conversation. \xa0So yes, it was deliberate to put that up front because when you do have habits for such a long time there\'s an inertia that\'s reinforced by your mindset. I think of the number of years that you\'ve had a particular gait pattern, you can think of your thoughts as also a pattern of thinking in that it is more ingrained by frequency and so the mind has to be almost jump started, I would say, right at the beginning. So I just wanted to get that out there in the introduction.', 'STEPHANIE: You note that ', ' isn\'t a book that suggests, ""Hey! You should start walking."" Why isn\'t it that book?', 'KATY: \xa0For that reason that I just mentioned which is, if we can consider that overarching thing of all books; Move more and move more of you. The move more, I would say, is more feasible when you have more mobilities available to you. \xa0When you have less mobility available to you your move more can quickly become kind of a repetitive use injury. When you have someone who has been stiff since they were 40 or 50 and they\'re now 60, that\'s like 20 years of using a particular gait habit. So if you start with the move more verses the move more of you, then for that person who\'s not already moving because the way that they moved was so narrow that it kind of eeked out certain growths of neuromas or pockets of inflammation, or whatever, to move more isn\'t really great. It\'s potentially, I would say, taking someone down the path of them just going on those old ... In my mind, I think of like a groove. There\'s a groove in the sidewalk and they just kind of etch back and forth on that groove. \xa0So the feasibility of moving more when you\'re very stiff and kind of in pain in a lot of places is very low. So someone\'s like, ""Yeah, I already know I\'m supposed to move more. That\'s not gonna help me. \xa0What are things that..."" You\'re transitioning, right? \xa0You\'re transitioning. We\'re imagining this person being someone somewhat sedentary. Maybe even an exerciser thought who is having these 7 or 8 ailments that kept creeping up in their life regularly. So instead of going with the move more, which is that ', ' portal that we were talking about last time, was going more to the ', ' which is; ""why don\'t you just while you\'re sitting there doing whatever you\'re doing, just think about your toes. Where\'s your head."" \xa0And so you started with these subtle but more frequent moves that when you get to the next chapters or moves that help you find muscles that better support larger moves. You know, I can tell someone to move more but if they don\'t have very balanced gait the outcomes of that aren\'t fantastic, potentially. I would rather have someone spend a couple of weeks finding a straight leg and some, develop some skill in their lateral hips so now, when they\'re walking they\'re not falling which then makes the next step of now we\'re gonna walk a little bit more all that more nourishing for them. \xa0And reduce the risk at the same time. So I am super mindful of telling a population that has, you know, statistically less balanced, maybe less awareness, less mobility, just to go out and start moving more. It\'s like we\'re gonna refine your movement while you\'re not doing such large transfers of your body a to b. \xa0Then we\'re gonna go up to that next step. That\'s why. I have been working with, when I was in graduate school, I ran a poll at that time, it was in the gerontology department.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0There's a word!"", 'KATY: \xa0If that\'s not a terrible word choice. Uh! \xa0It\'s just, yes, right? \xa0So I led this program as part of you know when you\'re going through your program \xa0you\'re teaching and working with different populations and this was one population that I worked on and I really really enjoyed working with this particular population, mostly because I found the people coming to class were super keen in their health in moving longer. \xa0I just found the tools to be somewhat lackluster. I mean they were doing balloon volleyball. \xa0Just to keep them moving was the overall thing. We just need to keep this population moving. And I was like that\'s great. I would like to get this population moving better, not just to keep them moving while their mobility was still declining but specifically target why their mobility was declining. That was more of interest to me. So I started doing some of these programs early on and I found this to be the most successful way. Not to bring them out and to make the exercise they had always done easier. Like maybe you had a bunch of volleyball athletes or basketball players and now give them balloons so they can move slower and have slower reflexive time. But actually work those things back so they could get their response time back and become more agile and more balanced. I thought it was pandering almost, the other way. \xa0So I valued what I learned there but I found that we could actually improve their overall outcomes, not just how much they moved during a bout when they came down to the university to exercise with us, of doing it this other way. Of going, ""I\'m going to give you a stronger base. I\'m gonna give you a larger base. You\'re gonna spread your toes. You now have a larger base of support and surprise, you had that all the time. Your base of support is determined by how mobile your feet are. You don\'t have to add a cane to increase your base of support. You can spread your toes. Oh, your shoes don\'t allow you to spread your toes. Interesting. You want to get a different pair of shoes maybe because your shoes are reinforcing your narrow base of support. Oh but they\'re giving you x, y, and z. Ok, well x, y, and z, we can also get that through hips or through selecting your environments better."" \xa0So it just, I liked the complexity of all of that. So. I found that organizing ', ' in a way that I had already seen work for, you know, about 1,000 or 2,000 goldeners. \xa0It was just the best way. It was just the way that I know how to teach that population. Let\'s put it that way. Maybe there is a ""just walk more"" program that\'s successful but in a different way. I\'m not sure but this is the way that has worked for me. It made the most sense to me.', ""STEPHANIE: It seems to me this is perhaps your most directly practical book. You're specifically calling out activities like walking on cobblestones which a lot of people who are retired might take a trip to Europe and be concerned about getting around on kind of uneven urban ground. Or driving. Or going up and down stairs. Can you say a bit about why you took that direct practical approach?"", 'KATY: You know, this is about me being changed after ', '. Because ', "", you know, I studied exercise science, biomechanics. These sciences, all sciences, they're pulling elements out. And if you're ... a good essay to read right now, just to pause this podcast, is Nutrient Centric or Nutrient Dense. We have gotten so, we are depending so much on being told which elements of a thing are the good thing that we have forgotten that the entire thing, that we need the entire thing. It's just that in this study that calls out Vitamin C, it didn't also look at fiber."", 'STEPHANIE: Right.', 'KATY: It didn\'t also look at picking the fruit. It didn\'t also look at the oil in it. \xa0Like, so what happens is when we get these, because the process takes so long of gathering knowledge we\'re given one bit at a time that because, you know, if you wait 100 years between the bits that you\'re given, you only know that the bit is good. \xa0And so then it reinforces the idea that you only need this bit. And so what has happened is that we believe that we need to exercise for our health. To be healthy we need to exercise. \xa0Versus the idea that you need movement to prime your body to be able to move for other things that you need. That being healthy is a very nebulous statement. Like to want health outside of the experience that health can provide you, that we\'re not tying it to any sort of experience, you know. We\'re just like, ""Oh I exercise therefore I am healthier because I did it."" And so when you have that framework a lot of times people will say, you know they\'re athletes or they do these major physical feats or they just go to class every single day and they are healthier for doing it. And they say, ""Yeah, the thing that I do, though, I got a stress fracture doing it.""', 'STEPHANIE: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: I\'m healthy because they define healthy as doing it. They define healthy as being brought by doing the exercise. It\'s not really relating to anything else any longer. ""Oh well I have, you know, I did get this stress fracture or I\'m having organ prolapse."" And they know that that ties into how they\'re doing their activity to be healthy. They can correlate the ill effects of the health back to the thing that they\'re doing for their health. But there\'s not cognitive dissonance there they just want to get back to ""can I just heal this so I can get back to doing the thing that makes me healthy.""', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0And that gave me the stress fracture.', 'KATY: Exactly. \xa0I have finally realized, if you want to talk about the evolution of thought or the development of a thought it\'s like, ""oh, this is a side effect of being a nutrient dense culture."" \xa0Especially within the health culture, is we don\'t see because, you know, we say ""I want to be able to play with my grandkids"" or ""I want to be able to carry my child without pubic symphysis pain"". \xa0We have forgotten to tie our pursuance of movement to something to movement then allows us to do that brings us joy. So that\'s the ', "" element. So now that I have that I don't think I'll ever write a book just about finding your optimal alignment or just to be generally healthy. \xa0I'm always asking... at the beginning of "", 'I asked everyone to take a piece of paper out and said: ""Write down your physical experience."" \xa0Put it on paper. Because I would suggest the things that are on this piece of paper for you are related to the ways that you are and are not moving. So with ', ' it\'s a little bit different. It\'s like, ""Did you want to go to Europe with your friends or your partner but you can\'t because you\'re afraid that you\'re not a strong enough walker so, therefore, you don\'t want to do this book just to be healthy. You want to do this book so that you are able to execute the things in your life that bring you joy or richness to life. Your experience."" \xa0And so that is why you will see things being framed in this way. Because I think ... like eating and moving well simply to quote be healthy doesn\'t mean anything.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: It's like teaching to the test. \xa0And we have found that teaching to the test does not correlate well to intelligence or to the experience that one person has. It's just perhaps easy."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: And so I\'m calling for an expansion of thought with my expansion of movement practice to start trying to.. ""What do you want to do with your life? What do you want to do with it?"" \xa0And then start adjusting your program to match the things that you would like your program to be able to facilitate for you so then you can go into your life and do those things. \xa0So you\'ll see that in ', ' for sure.', 'KATY: \xa0Of which two?', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Move \xa0Your DNA and ', '.', ""KATY: Yeah. You know it's so subtle. In the "", "" there's like 30 or 40 positions of how not to use your chair."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0\xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: In ', ', it\'s like ""hey, why don\'t you sit in your chair a little differently."" Or, ""have you ever thought of sitting on the floor? Put a couple cushions down there and sit on there."" Right? \xa0It\'s gentle.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. Or when you're getting out of your chair, think about maybe getting up this way."", 'KATY: Exactly.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Since you're getting up anyway."", 'KATY: Exactly.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: So it\'s definitely about infusing your life with movement. \xa0It\'s not, there\'s again, here\'s what you do for exercise. But again these exercises plus you now thinking about having to move during your non-exercise time: when you\'re standing in line or when you\'re getting up off of the toilet or off of your chair, that you\'re doing it like you do an exercise. \xa0Like we all ... so many people know that there\'s like a ... you go to a personal trainer to help you with form for your exercises. We just don\'t think that form applies to anything else besides our non-exercise time. \xa0So it\'s kind of like, ""here\'s the form for all the movements that you\'re doing and once you do them the cool thing is you\'ll be shaping your body in a way where movement becomes more easy."" And then you can start doing other things in ', ' like add texture and terrain. You know those things are broken down as relates to mechanotransduction and changes in geometry and very exercise science. \xa0In ', "", it's like, do you feel like if you go to a park, that park is not really inclusive simply because your body is only able to handle the flat cement part of it. It would be really great if you could start walking on the grass just next to it because that's going to challenge - move these other muscles - which, once you get home and you stumble on something, now you are more, you are trained, you are preparing for the fact that you are going to meet some lumps and bumps along the way. So the idea that, and I put the idea that, right now the idea in many therapies, occupational therapy, gerontology again, home health for this goldener population is make your house as obstacle free as possible."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: Not ever mentioning train for obstacles.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: But just get rid of them. Get rid of them so that really leaving your house becomes detrimental to your health because there's no one picking up obstacles for you out of your house. So that mindset, to me, is very very narrow and what happens is a cast. It creates a scenario where you are only safe within your home. And that's what I'm talking about this lock... you lose experiences available to you by dealing with safety not through working with your physical robusticity. \xa0And certainly become aware of obstacles and things. But just eliminating them. Eliminate all the dangers. Just eliminate those in your bubble and thus you have to stay in it. And I find that just having worked with a lot of populations, I was like the people with that greatest mindset can't leave their home. They have to put their shoes on the first thing when they wake up. So they're ending up less and less mobile rather than kind of offering practical here's how to make your home more safe and here's how to make your body more safe in and out of your home. So I definitely think they can be paired up but there is a prevailing wisdom that people just aren't going to do it so the end."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Let's just give them the safety bullet. \xa0I was like ok, well, I would say that based on the viewers of the "", ' that there\'s a lot of people who said, ""There\'s something I could do to become stronger when I\'m 60 or 70 or 80? I don\'t believe it. Are you kidding me?"" ', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. I have options?', ""KATY: Yeah. \xa0And so I just, I like to keep everyone's options open. And then they can experiment personally to see what's available to them."", ""KATY: Oh well, see to me it's the intersection of them."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mmm.', 'KATY: ', "" is the first book that's equally, I think, "", ' and ', "". You'll even see community. You'll see green space in nature and blue space. I don't even know if this made it in. So I met Maria Shriver doing the "", '. \xa0And ', "" ... I don't know if it's hers or she heads it or she's just on the board for research into why so many more women have Alzheimer's than men. And so she had a big event that I got to go speak on the panel for and bring my perspective into it. I could do a whole show... this would be a great side topic because I find it to be fascinating. \xa0So this is about the difference between exercise ... I mean this is why "", ' will be more ', '. \xa0The thing that is most protective against Alzheimer\'s is, I\'ll put air quotes around ""exercise"". I would say that it\'s movement. Right now the word choice is exercise. But in further delineation, because I find that for people who both have the same genetic precursors to get you know early onset or a particular type of Alzheimer\'s and other dementias, if they get exercising, they can maintain their brain mass where a loss of brain mass can be a hallmark of Alzheimer\'s versus a group that doesn\'t. So it\'s very protective. It is the single thing, like, yes there\'s these other things that are popping up here and there but just get moving. Get exercising. Right? And so exercise is a big push for this women\'s Alzheimer\'s agenda. They\'re outreach. It\'s just about we have to get moving. Which I agree.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: They found that it wasn't exercise per se but physical activity, specifically gardening and then they also found some correlation between animal owning, dog owning."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh-huh.', ""KATY: So they're like these are actually things that require movement. \xa0More complex movement then maybe just doing your exercise. And to me, that's what "", "" is about. That there is more richness to be found in non-exercise movement because if it's happening within your life, the fact that you're actually just getting more movement of you. And then you're getting things like vitamin D from the sun and fresh air and who knows what else from the earth and from dealing with plants. \xa0Things that haven't even been researched yet. \xa0And so that's why you will see recommendations. You know, I think the recommendations are get into a garden because it exercises you more. It's like get into a garden because it allows for more non-exercise movement. Those are saying two different things."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: So there's a lot of that. The benefits just simply of being in nature, shinrinyoku, being around plants for healthy aging and stress management. There's one tip that I love that came to me right after "", "" that's in "", ' which is; you know, there are simple things like don\'t use the drive through. And we see don\'t use the drive through. \xa0And we see don\'t use the drive through as something that increases activity. But when you\'re dealing with a goldener population they aren\'t only void of movement, they\'re void of others. \xa0When you walk into some place you get to make eye contact with somebody else. You get to have a conversation. When you don\'t use your ATM, when you drive in and talk to the teller, that\'s a physical connection. \xa0So, one of the taxes of automation is not only the loss of physical movement but the loss of all of the other variables that used to come packaged with it: \xa0Community, smiling. \xa0What happens when someone smiles at you? I\'m sure there\'s research on being around other people but you\'re not going to put it in an exercise book because this is only for physical activity. And I say ""No More!"" From now on I\'m going to talk about all aspects of movement and it\'s like when you don\'t walk in, you don\'t touch anyone else with a hand, you don\'t touch anyone else with your eyes or in a smile. So I started to put all that into ', ' just to say, ""Yeah, you\'re gonna go inside because it gives you more time to practice your standing alignment and you get to connect with other people in your community and have a chance to use your voice and vocalize and talk, and exchange information. And you get your bank thing done."" \xa0All of that was more than your exercise. \xa0So yeah. \xa0', ' and ', "" together, I would say, in that book. Maybe that's what makes it the best or the most robust. And it's not even for...

And yes there's a little more white space between lines..."", 'KATY: Sure.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0...so it's accessible.

Because that piece wasn't only on our book, it was on superagers, right? \xa0And they said that the hallmark of superagers, I'm paraphrasing, but it wasn't like memory games. It wasn't that they were sitting and doing crossword puzzles and keeping their brain active. It's that they were doing new and challenging things. That they would do the work. They would overcome whatever it is that resistance to getting started. They would just do it. \xa0And those people age really well. And that is definitely of the co-authors, that is their, that's what they did. Yes, it's the moves, but it's like that they all decided to study something in their 70s."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: And learn a whole new set of language. And work through the hard part to have their brain reorganized around that information. And my dad, who died at 89 and 3/4, you know he started playing the bagpipes when he was 50. And started playing the banjo when he was 60. He wasn't ever afraid to do the thing. He also was always into health. My grandmother, so my dad would have been 90 in June, a couple of weeks ago it was his 90th birthday. \xa0His mother had him when she was in her mid-30s. Unheard of back then."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Oh gosh.', 'KATY: She was just old. She\'s been old my whole life. She was 85 when I was born. Anyway, she was a health, she was a supplement, health food, water junkie. Totally unheard of in the 40s and the 50s. But he got that. \xa0Exercise every day. My dad always exercised. So my dad, here he is, he\'s 90 days from dying. \xa0And he\'s constantly kind of like he is ready. He\'s ready to go. \xa0And but at the same time he ordered the Whole 30. \xa0He goes, ""you know, I got your.."" He reads my newsletters always. \xa0""I followed your links in the newsletter and I got to this book by,"" he\'s like, ""heart wag or..."" \xa0And I was like, ""Oh yeah, Hartwig."" \xa0He said, ""Whole 30. I\'m gonna start that."" \xa0You know? And he was like regularly going in between and like being ready to go but like also ready to just do all the... I found a to do list from him and it, he had read half of the Whole 30. And made notes of like these are ok. He\'s like ""I\'m gonna have to change everything."" He got this and that and then he got ', '. And I put that in his hand and I mentioned the to do list and it was like ""Get back to an hour of exercise a day."" Which he did maybe up until the last 6 months.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mmm.', 'KATY: Always being the exerciser. \xa0He opened that book and he read it. And I\'m here, I was with him, kind of all day in his apartment. I would just set up my office there just to always be there. And he, this was so him, he would read, he read a section and be like, ""huh."" \xa0And he wasn\'t talking about it with me. I was just doing my work. He\'s just reading it and I\'d see him like kick his shoes off, and like look down and spread his toes.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0(laughs)', 'KATY: And then he\'s like, ""Go get me the... go get me that half roll thing."" \xa0Which he always had. He would stretch that every day. And then he got up and he still had, he had a walker at that point.

There wasn\'t any, oh that sounds like a lot of work. He just didn\'t have that personality. Mr. three jobs, six miles. He was just that guy. \xa0So yeah. I was happy to have him read that book, you know, and feedback as a ninety-year-old. You know he\'s reading it himself.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: He\'s like, ""This spacing is great.

They don\'t work anymore. Two different statements. So we\'re just gonna work on mobilizing the fingers and the thumbs and the wrists and the forearms.

I felt like I had a lot more time and overall it was a great summer. \xa0Again, though, it was like a work intensive summer because I was busy figuring out ways to get things done. And I'm also preparing. I'm going to New Zealand for two months and so that was a lot of introduced work. So it was just, I mean, I've been thinking a lot about this idea in the "", "" which is in eastern Indian text and at the crux of it is you're entitled to the labor but no fruits from the labor. "", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm.', ""KATY: And that has really sat with me heavily. It's like, ok, there's always work. There's no getting rid of the work or whatnot. So I've been relishing in the work. I've done a lot. If you get our "", "" newsletters where I've been sending out some pictures of what we've been doing."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yes. Glorious.', ""KATY: I've been doing a lot of work. A lot of harvesting. A lot of processing in novel ways. And I'm certainly a complete novice. In no way even, like, I'm just dipping my toe into this idea of less outsourcing.

And learning and enjoying it. Enjoying the labor. Feeling like, ok, the labor is what I'm owed, but nothing else. So that's what my summer has been all about."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Well that is pretty profound. And did you say earlier you wrote some letters?', ""KATY: Like hand wrote them. Like on a piece of paper. Like your grandma used to do. Like my grandma still does. \xa0And little things, you know, you get, my grandma still sends me things and it's easier for me to call her back but to go, you know what, I forgot how great it is to get mail and to see kids getting mail. So just poppin' a few cards out there and..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Nice.', 'KATY: \xa0You know, also, the crap in my house related to this, shouldn\'t use the word ""crap""... like related to my job. Like the stacks of books. The stacks of books in other languages. Galleys. Like what am I supposed to do with it? I have got all of these books and I feel like why would a book sit in my house? \xa0Why would seven copies of a book sit in my house? I can\'t read it seven times. And if I could, I\'m not going to read seven different versions. So trying to figure out how do I distribute these to the community? And figuring out where to donate them and how to dispense them in a meaningful way. And that adds work. But in the end that work, you know, gets information to people so I\'m happy to do it. But yeah, just a lot of that kind of logistics. So popping things in the mail. Going oh hey, by the way, here\'s a copy of this book. So, just sending things, I send so many... does anyone else do this? \xa0Or maybe do you? \xa0Since no one can answer - Romper Room. \xa0Do you send cards and gifts in your mind?

But also sometimes maybe the labor counts as well."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Physically actually doing it. So I've been trying to do it a little bit more and setting a space. I remember my stepmom used to sit in front of, she would watch M*A*S*H and she would write. Like she had a legal pad of paper and she would write. And I just remember her writing and writing and writing. Every night she would sit down to write. You know much like I would sit down and look through Instagram. \xa0And then my older siblings would say, she was writing her sister but she would write her sister over the course of a week."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Oh I love it.', 'KATY: And then pop it into the mail. So the letter was comprised of what happened each day. And her sister was doing the same thing. And then they would swap.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Oh. \xa0', 'KATY: And they could totally call.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: But it's a different type of connection. It's a... I mean all these things that we like, uh, books, this is how it relates to books."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: And written text. \xa0Like we go back to written texts for historical perspectives and so there's a difference between oral communication and written communication and I'm not... I don't know if one's better than the other. Certainly written is more open to interpretation by other people where oral lands on the audience that it was intended for often times. You know. But there was just a different quality to it. And fidget spinners. I just came to learn what a fidget spinner is. \xa0Only to realize that it's a thing that everyone else knows except for me."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Right well you weren't on social media all summer so that's how that got by you."", 'KATY:', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Someone has identified, you know, maybe a dormant, which we've talked about on various podcasts before, either you or I or Dani.

I'm encountering myself there too."", 'KATY: Sure', '.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0And there's something very deep about that."", ""KATY: Yeah.

It's a "", ', ', "" moment for me to recognize, oh, ok, this is, I'm only working on myself. \xa0Everyone is doing their own thing. And so I guess for me it's helpful for me to observe and go ok, ok, here we go. \xa0I can call it a different word to give it a different context which helps me then change the parts of me that I'm willing to change at this time. \xa0So that's my summer in a fidget spinner."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Goodness me. You do go deep when you go. \xa0As for me as we're kind of standing here you know with our toes just getting wet, in September, I think of September as the true new year.

I flourished in that and I don't know if it was you and I were talking about it or in our larger work group but the idea that back to school is really the new year's resolution time.

I think certainly for children, but once within children in your own home, summer is a very different landscape than fall, just in terms of everyday behavior. Where I don\'t know if the same is true between December and January. \xa0Right? Like it\'s, that\'s our New Year time because it lines up with the Gregorian calendar but you\'ve changed. You grew. All these things are different during the summer and then you come into fall and you\'re like, ""what is my intention?"" \xa0So it\'s like the new year. So I definitely, just like I would get out the college schedule to nerd out what my life was going to be like, it\'s, yes, this is the new year. This is it. If I were making a calendar it would start now.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. It's also the time when, you know, grown ups who have been outside all summer are maybe also coming back from vacation, back to work, back to their desks, their cubicles. It's time to get serious. So I think it's appropriate that this is the week that we're going to talk about "", '.', 'KATY: Right.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0In this episode of the podcast.', 'KATY: Yes yes. So great.', 'STEPHANIE: ', 'KATY: \xa0Oh, this book was written right after ', '. Like six weeks after. And I wrote it because ', ' who is a big paleo icon and has ... ', ' is his big book. He wanted me to write, like how would you apply ', ' to office workers. \xa0The request was more, it was a few years ago, but it was like, ""How do we get people who are really"", if we\'re all in a cultural box, their box is more literal for 8 hours a day. Everyone has different work set ups. But, when you walk into that cubicle, kind of the orca in the tank, like you feel it more than maybe someone who was like, ""I work from home so I can work in this room or this room."" Like your physical freedom is even less so, I think, when you have a smaller office within a building within your life. So it was a question like, ""Is it really even possible for this person to add more movement?"" To which I was like, ""Certainly."" But it\'s hard to ask someone, I was in that situation, to come up with those ways. To derive the plan from these broader ideas, like, just switch how you move throughout the day, when you feel like your landscape is tiny. And so it\'s just that. It\'s a tiny book about how to apply ... I would say it\'s a very practical book. It\'s a book on ... you know transitioning to minimal footwear had a very specific agenda. \xa0Don\'t Just Sit There is about transitioning to a dynamic workstation. Not just a standing workstation. And similarly how I wrote ', ', really to put out, I would say, a more robust argument to the ""hey barefoot\'s natural, shoes are not. So go barefoot."" \xa0I was like, ok, well there\'s more to the argument than that. \xa0At the time that ', ' came out which was like 2014, was right in that 2012-2014 where all this sitting is the new smoking...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yes.', 'KATY: ...literature and headlines were coming out. So like everyone\'s like ""Standing workstation. Desks are unnatural. Standing\'s natural. Stand."" \xa0Now it\'s like, ok, hold on. So I wanted a place to put a more robust argument simply that standing and sitting are just both static. And when you looked at the literature for sitting they hadn\'t delineated the difference between sitting and sedentary, which is unmoving despite the position. A little bit more has come out since then but at that point, it was simply that these are what\'s associated with sitting and we hadn\'t broken up whether or not it was the sedentarism or the fact that your position was unchanging or it was, in fact, the position of sitting in a chair. I broaden it up in ', "", it's likely both."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0But they're separate."", ""KATY: But they're separate. They're separate. And so before we go out and spend two thousand dollars making our office over to a standing office or telling schools that they all need to get thousands of dollars of like standing desks, let's just think critically for a moment. \xa0So "", ' is that pause to say ""What\'s actually happening"" and how, just like ', "", it's basically "", ""but applied to your office. There's these small transitional steps. This idea that you can adjust your body a little bit within the shoes/office that you already have. \xa0You do not have to go out and spend a lot of money making things over. I'm always trying to be really conscious of that, this information is accessible to anyone, you know, who can source a few items like a crate, or whatever. You know that you can have this too. It's not a consumer based ... argument. I don't want to - being a driving force to consuming more is the opposite to the direction I want to go. Although recognizing that for some, a new product makes the habit easier - which is fine. I just don't want it to be perceived or even like require that you buy a bunch of new stuff."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right. \xa0Because at the end of the book you do offer a long list of products: keyboards, lights, software, pillows, to help keep your workspace more dynamic.', 'KATY: Totally.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0So you're saying that's an option but it's not a requirement."", ""KATY: Well it's not a requirement but there will be someone who will say, when you're working with a very diverse audience, you get HR departments contacting you, well then what should we be supplying our people with. You have people who are like, I can't have a crate in my office. I have the budget for this. \xa0And then there are like really innovating things. Like the thing that I thought was the best was "", "" so that you could use your shoulder joints at all sorts of different rotations. Totally not feasible for most people to have, to make everything in their office as malleable as possible, but for some person out there, a key piece could make the difference. So I just wanted to ... and it's also to kind of highlight the market. To say these ideas are permeating the market as a way to kind of show sometimes the rigidity of the current infrastructure. You know what I mean."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: We all have the same chair. The schools all have the same desk. Schools have a much stiffer budget, I would say, but I think for a lot of offices or what not they all kind of look the same as they did 60 years ago. \xa0And then we're trying to come up with different heights. And then sometimes a product is nice to kind of highlight what it is that I need."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Which is like if your keyboard is always in front of you, if you put your hands on your fake keyboard, that's one shoulder position all the time. Meaning, to use a keyboard casts your shoulders. So if you have a keyboard that is two parts that you can put at whatever width that you want, now you have a keyboard that allows for 50 different variations if you scoot it tiny bits at a time. \xa0And if you only do it two or three - three different ones. So, if you're dealing with a frozen shoulder or you feel like you can't be productive in the work place because of your particular shoulder or elbow or wrist means that the conventional workspace doesn't work for you, there are options. So it's just a way in that I like to present as robustly as possible all the way from a DIY to here's all the market pieces and as well as this idea that you might not have to have this same work structure. I like to put that idea out as well which is a little bit radical, I think sometimes. \xa0And I throw that in the last sentence in "", "". \xa0It's like, is your job working for you? \xa0Because I think that we perceive that we are unable to change jobs and certainly the luxury of being able to swap jobs is dependent on many many factors. \xa0But it's nice to think of that as malleable too."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Right. And we're gonna get to that. But I think we'll take the same approach in this conversation that you would take in writing about it and we'll kind of sneak up on it. For now, I want to flash back to the lightning round that we did in the very first episode together."", 'KATY: I think I blocked it.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0You were pretty worried about it in the moment but you did pass with flying colors.', 'KATY: Thank you!', 'STEPHANIE: ', 'KATY: Oh right. Ok, yes.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Is it in some ways as simple as that?', ""KATY: \xa0Yeah. I mean I feel chairs are really really prevalent not only in the work space but all the time. Just get out of your chair. Do something different. Even if you sit right back down again at least you got up. Like that's one squat for you. Hey. So yes. Yes. I think the chair is like sucking the movement potential out of your body. So just get out of it. \xa0It's not to say that you can't rest but maybe rest in some other way. If you could change your chair relationship it would be huge for you."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0But at the same time don't just stand there either."", ""KATY: Absolutely. That's not really movement. \xa0You know, at the end of the day, getting into a standing position once in just another sedentary position. So stand up, yes. And then, and then, because it's a dynamic workstation, do something after you've stood up."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Like what?', ""KATY: Like pay attention to where you're carrying your weight on your feet. Is it only on one? Is it on two? \xa0Maybe put it between the two. Does it go forward? Does it go back? \xa0Can it go right forward left back? \xa0And you go the other way. So standing is like a category. We think of standing as simply like only the soles of the feet are in contact but I could come up with, and you could come with me, 30 different things to be doing while you are just standing there that would make it so that you're not just standing there. You know what I mean? I guess it's a mindful thing. Don't just stand up and then stop thinking about your movement for the day. \xa0Standing up is the point at which you start thinking about it. And that's critical for standing desk users which is really a key component to"", '. ', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0So part of what comes into play with this book and it's something that you dig much more deeply into in "", "" is movement is counter cultural. \xa0You know, there's something that we're learning in school that sitting still in our seats conforming to the tidy rows of bodies of desks. And that's something that we have to work really hard to shake as adults. I feel like this message is under the surface of this book on every page. \xa0Can you talk more about the idea of movement, especially in an office setting, as being counter culture."", 'KATY: Yeah, and I think that\'s also part of the motivator for writing the book because everyone is like, ""I would love to do more but frankly I\'m going to be an outlier in the office."" And so movement as counter culture is this idea that, now keep in mind that I can put anything under the movement bubble. Even your shoes. Right? A shoe choice. \xa0We\'re always back to the feet. All roads point back to the feet. The idea of switching your shoe in ', ', this idea to go towards a minimal shoe, a big response to that is, ""but my shoes don\'t look professional."" \xa0', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh huh.', 'KATY: You know what I mean? So that would actually, and there were so many, just to tie it back to, to tie ', ' to ', ', when all these standing desk products came out in the market, the people using them, like there are these women in the videos wearing 3-4 inch high heels. \xa0And I\'m like, those high heels were bad enough for you when you had to walk the quarter mile, you know, like into your office to then sit down in them. Now, this is implying that you\'re supposed to stand in them for 7 hours a day which is, of course, going to shape you way differently than if you just wore them into the office and sat down. And I got a ton of questions. I mean, crazy as these things seem, it\'s like oh that seems like such a random thought. I get heaps of emails to just that which is like, ""Everyone in my office is uncomfortable when I choose to stand up."" \xa0Or, you know, if I go to a meeting and want to not sit, like my ability to hear isn\'t dependent on my butt...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Being in a chair.', ""KATY: ...closing a circuit in a chair. But now you're hovering. You're awkward. And maybe just that you're different. You're doing something differently. And in a work space, you're trying to stand out. I imagine for many people trying to achieve, or publish, or get accounts, or all my work models are like 80s movies right now, you're trying to get the ad campaign. \xa0Doesn't everyone work in an advertising executive office?"", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I think so.', 'KATY: In New York City.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Your self-employed status is showing hard here right now.', 'KATY: I know! \xa0So I always keep that in mind. But I read a lot and in ', ', I use an article that this woman had written about other people using standing desks and how she felt that they were lording how healthy they were over her.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: And it was like ""just sit down already."" \xa0So, ok. That\'s what I mean by counter culture. This person, like this person standing, doesn\'t really affect you. Meaning, they\'re not affecting how many words you type per minute. I don\'t know if there could be any really literal impact that they\'re pursuit of how they want to, like their choice of how they want to use their body really impacts you. But we perceive it does so hard that now, I mean, this woman was writing an article about it. \xa0And publishing it. Like it\'s a distaste for someone else trying to be healthy.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: Or trying to do something because in her mind it's done smugly. It's done with condescension of her choice to sit. Like that is a reality. And I think it's in schools, it's in parenting, it's in friendships, it's in everything. Like we have a sedentary culture so if you choose simply to move more, your behavior is threatening other people."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0It's perceived as a judgment, perhaps."", 'KATY: Yeah. I mean, yes. But like met with vitriol.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: \xa0Like I find this phenomenon very interesting where, and we just got done with a RES training so we have a lot of people who are in our training who are here and we\'re talking about that and they\'re like, ""Why two books on shoes? Why are we starting with the feet? \xa0Why are they that important?"" And I\'m like, this is all to help direct a sedentary culture out of sedentarism. But when any aspect of a culture changes the rest of the culture is like reactionary and I was like, I find it very interesting at the vitriol that comes with something as benign as footwear. Like that, that is such a mainstay of the culture, every part, that when you start toggling with what shoes I choose to wear that have absolutely no effect on you, at least physically...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: ... unless you read some things and they\'re like, ""I\'m disgusted."" Ok, now they have all of the chemicals of disgust running through their body because of what I put on my feet. \xa0I think that\'s important to understand. And so when people are spewing acid on each other about what they\'re putting on their feet and what\'s acceptable how are we to do other things like getting, like saying that kids could move more during the school day. Or other things that you know that scientific literature would be ""yes, great. We need this."" \xa0But the culture is like, ""Blech..."" So movement as counter culture is real. \xa0What keeps you sedentary is the pressure, I think, to not have that vitriol come towards you. Or sometimes it\'s like, ""I just don\'t like the way they look."" \xa0But when you dial it down it\'s like, ""I feel unattractive."" \xa0Where does that come from? \xa0Like other people are judging me. My outfit doesn\'t look put together. \xa0I\'m not going to get promoted. Real consequences for certain. So can I write a book, then, that helps people go as low profile as they want, as they feel comfortable doing, so that we can kind of eek out more movement. I guess in the end that\'s always my end goal. Is to help people who want to move more have strategies to be able to do it. It\'s like all my books are a sedentary life exit strategy.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Ah Ha!', 'KATY: In small little bits. So ', "" has got really simple stuff like, ok, just sit differently. Don't ditch the chair, keep the shoes, keep the office. Don't do anything else but like hopefully you have enough sovereignty over the position of your pelvis in your chair. Go!"", 'STEPHANIE: ', ""KATY: Well it's certainly making you sedentary."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: So, I don't really shy away from ideas because you know the book is just a conversation between the author and the reader. Like I'm not out there, you know, like I don't even know. Is there a place where corporations all come together to discuss what's going in the opposite... no ... I'm not trying to even have giant conversations with the world. I write my ideas down in a book and the person who picks it up receives them. So it's a conversation to say, here's some things to consider. Your pelvis can be in a different position. Your rib cage can be in a different position. \xa0Your arms... here's the position that they're in 99% of the time. \xa0Here's some things that it links to. Hey, your office set up is affecting those things. I'm just kind of showing how it works and that's the lovely thing about introducing ideas is the receiver can choose to do what they want to do about them. So what I try to do is a scale, right? You can adjust your pelvis. Or you can quit your job. And you know like my intention is never to get people to quit their jobs. My intention is to highlight, I think, the choices we make on a regular basis. I think I talked about that at the end of my social media break. It's not, again, to have everyone else go on a social media break. It's simply to kind of keep noting that there are choices. That there are freedoms that we have. And movement sovereignty is something that I, like if I had to have a key passion, movement sovereignty would be kind of a very large umbrella for this idea that we are slowly losing movement sovereignty. And this is, I don't think I used those words anywhere within "", ' but it\'s another set of words that kind of help to say we have to stay aware to it, you know, so how walkable ... How walkable are your cities? Like we\'re looking at a structure. We\'re trying to evaluate society: the costs and benefits of it. And I don\'t think there\'s a lot of talk about the movement aspects of our society. How those movement aspects have changed dramatically. How they\'re continuing to change even more towards sedentarism and how the loss of the movements are relating to these other problems but we\'re not noticing the linkage between the two. So there\'s just this society and here\'s just the problem with humans. It\'s like, not humans. Humans within this particular structure. And here\'s the sedentarism so that we can start, you know, there\'s definitely a trend towards normalizing how humans in this structure are and it\'s only recently that we\'ve started to compare ourselves to other humans and to say, ""ok, not a human condition."" \xa0Humans in this particular structure... the next step is to go, ""ok, so if we know that these are basically symptoms of this particular structure, how do we change the structure?"" So this has been happening in education for a long time, I would say, but going ""hey, this system doesn\'t work for everybody. Here are some other options."" Same thing with work or the office setting. It\'s like, hey there might be other ways of getting work done but changing infrastructure is tough so I thought well you could change within your infrastructure. You don\'t even have to change your infrastructure yet. You can change your infrastructure from the inside. Your body is an infrastructure. Change that.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Just start changing that. And here's twelve simple physical adjustments that you do within your infrastructure and then you become a little bit more robust and then I feel like you push on the infrastructure around you with a little bit more strength."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0', ""KATY: Ooh, gosh. \xa0Well, it's definitely, oh, I would say that the start of the book is "", '.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: It's "", "".

And then I also, I think another ', ' aspect of ', ' is the idea that ergonomics, that we\'ve taken ergonomics which is the science of kind of the optimal position of your body if your body has to have a ... if you put a certain set of parameters around your body. Like, ""Hey I\'ve got to come to this office every single day for 35 years and I\'m gonna be sitting in a chair like this doing work just like this..."" Right? So you\'ve got a very narrow range of motion, like, ""What\'s the best way to do that?"" \xa0We\'ve taken that and we do research \xa0on it and then we say, ""Ok here\'s the best way to do that one movement for 35 years in the exact same way."" But what\'s being confounded is like, oh this is the best way to use your body. That we\'re taking ergonomics which pertains to an already heavily unnatural, not optimal, known to be damaging to various aspects of your health and say ""Here\'s how to do that best.""

It\'s a misunderstanding of that when you collect data from a particular group what the end result...what the application or the intention is supposed to be and confusing it with if you read it in a research paper that that means it\'s good for you. Which is a very common understanding of what the scientific process is. So I think it\'s just a few short sentences to say that ""That\'s not what ergonomics is."" \xa0Ergonomics arguably is not the best way to use your body. It\'s a study of work.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.

And because everyone\'s in it. Everyone\'s in the fish tank, we\'re all the Orcas, it\'s very challenging to see. So I don\'t really dwell on it because my job isn\'t, like my intention, again, isn\'t to make you feel like, ""Well I have to work."" Right we all work. I\'m in front of a computer right now. It\'s that we don\'t lose the understanding. That we don\'t lose the knowledge of it. We all have the choices. \xa0We all are in this society.

And of course it\'s always to eek more movement, you know, into your body.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0', ""KATY: You don't have to be sedentary to be productive. And, again, I've written a lot of books. I do a lot of work that would line up with the work of what many people are listening and feel like they have to do now. I have just figured out how to stay moving while doing it. And I don't mean that I live on a farm and I can do chicken chores in between. Like if you put me in a cubicle, I would still be productive and I would still stay moving. But one piece that I have, I would say, that takes development is that I don't care. That I don't feel like other people, how other people feel is just how they feel."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Right. You're not going to sit down and be still to make other people less uncomfortable."", ""KATY: \xa0Yeah. And I do a lot to make other people not feel uncomfortable.

And so this is me kind of doing that work. And you know, I'll take the criticism. I'll take the anger. I'll take the vitriol. And I've just become better and better at letting the vitriol.

To be determined.', 'KATY: Exactly.', 'STEPHANIE: ', 'KATY: We\'re all standing. So the first thing is how do we stay moving while we stand? \xa0So your pelvis is your fidget spinner in this case. So you\'re going to shift your weight all the way back toward your heels and then you can go forward toward your toes. And then go back toward your heels. You can go all the way to the right with your hips. All the way to the left with your hips. These are pretty inconspicuous. IF someone was watching you they\'d be like, ""Oh her back\'s bothering her. That\'s why she\'s moving."" Or whatever. \xa0You can also, while you\'re standing, and keep in mind that people stood for labor. And still do. We have a lot of data on people who stand all day at work and frankly it\'s different injuries than people who sit all day but it\'s still kind of the same.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: You gotta stay moving. But the part that takes the greatest burden, I think is the lowest part of your legs. Your feet and your calves and then the veins and the tissues within them. So if you can rise up onto your toes and come back down. If you can kind of think of that pumping action, then as you're standing, you're not kind of pooling, p-o-o-l-i-n-g so much blood to your lower calf."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Huh.', 'KATY: \xa0So you can kind of do calf raises. Coming up and coming down. \xa0And if you want to ', "" it, you can do elevators which are calf raises that require that you stabilize your ankle when you come up and down. So there's the general calf raise when you just go up and down but your ankles kind of fall out away from the midline and fall back in. And then you can do elevators which means that you hold your ankles just like you would hold an elevator so it goes straight up and straight down, not kind of falling out right and to the left because we're not in the Willy Wonka Factory where you have elevators that go in all directions. So you're gonna go straight up and straight down. And then you know you can reach one foot behind you. Tuck the top of the foot. And then you can switch. Uh if you had a ball kind of beneath your standing work desk, or a dome, or something where you could put the front part of your toes up and do a little calf stretch there. And you switch and do the other side. Now you are essentially just doing all the exercises you find all the other places that you would normally do during your exercise time, you're doing them also while you're being productive."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Hashtag Stack Your Life #stackyourlife', 'KATY: Exactly.

Because I could say that knowing movement could be demonstrated by physical skills. What if I put that parameter on it as a way of knowing? In which case your practice, the way that you would engage with this, would change. So I thought ok, well, one month, an hour a day, is an easy way to test the 1 hour to 30 hours hypothesis.

On this show, we talk about how movement works on the cellular level, how to move more and how to move more of your parts and how movement works in the world, also known as Movement Ecology. All bodies are welcome here. Are you ready to get moving?', 'Music', 'KATY: \xa0I was the local newspaper at 4 years old. And I\'ve got the clipping here and the picture shows a little kid with braids, kneeling on the ground, filling a cut off eggnog carton with dirt and little plant and it reads: \xa0""Gardener Katy Bowman, 4, works on technique."" Although I was raised on a small commercial apple farm - so I did a lot of labor for the growing and selling of our apples - my gardening skill set has barely grown in 40 years because I didn\'t do much of it between then, when I was 4, and now that I\'m 42. \xa0I wrote on ', ' in early 2017, I think, ""I realized through my work in research on sedentary cultures that I really needed to be moving my body for the food I ate."" \xa0That\'s largely what makes a sedentary population possible - it\'s a lack of moving for food. So wild food for sure. That\'s a set of skills I\'ve also been working on. But in our culture, it\'s so much more feasible for the millions who can to start learning to grow stuff. \xa0Anything really. And I\'ve been doing that as well. And I\'m ok at being a totally crappy gardener. Because I\'m essentially back at age 4. Similarly to how I was learning how to write. My writing at 4 was really terrible compared to how I write now, but it actually wasn\'t relatively terrible compared to the level of practice that I had writing. So just keep that in mind. I\'m doing, trying, making mistakes, reorienting, doing, trying again, learning, adopting, lather, rinse, repeat. \xa0So, terrible or not, I derive a lot of nutrition out of that time in my garden. Because gardening is a simple way to stack my life. I get time outside, time with my family. I get lifting, bending, squatting, walking, digging - and I get all of those movements out in nature or green space. I\'m growing food that we can actually eat. I\'m growing a knowledge set that is really mine to keep. Meaning I could lose a lot of things but I can\'t lose really the skill set that I\'ve developed to know how to grow stuff. I could lose all my tools, but I\'ve got the tool on how to do it and that stays with me. So even though I haven\'t been doing it long and I am by no means an expert gardener, I keep at it. \xa0So this year I\'ve focused on plants that return every year - perennials. And I didn\'t do too many annuals which are plants that needed to be planted every year. And last year I did a ton of annuals. I was gone for, I guess, at least 30 days. I had to travel for work. And so I decided to focus on perennials instead. So I built a bed for herbs and strawberries in my front yard. For my birthday I asked for nut trees and we made a small nut forest of walnuts and hazelnuts. And wood! Yo! It turns out you can grow your own heat if you\'ve got space to plant a tree or two. And I learned that all over rural and urban communities people have started community gardens to give access to a garden - a solution to some problem. \xa0Because there are always more thoughts to grow and more to learn, I\'m very happy to have Dr. Rose Hayden-Smith as my guest on the podcast today. She\'s an expert on gardens but not in the way you might think. And she\'s gonna be here to share her three tips for taking action in the garden today. And of course, I will share my tips too. ', 'Great question. I posted ', "" last year so I'll link that in the show notes. \xa0If you can think of your bag and the way that you carry it as creating a load and if you can consider that each load is a particular movement or it lights up a particular set of muscles, then I will let you all think for a minute to see if you can figure out my answer..."", ""Ok, it's not a minute. How about 15 seconds. \xa0If you guess there's not one superior bag shape or a way I recommend carrying one, then you'd be correct. But to break it down quickly, let's assume you have a single bag. In this case, I'd recommend varying your carry. And that is to carry that bag in different ways. Over your right shoulder and then over your left, as a backpack, in your arms. \xa0Hopefully, you get the idea. Also if you search my hashtag "", ' on Instagram, that was ... I\'m sorry ... just me even reading that sentence felt really hilarious. ""Search my hashtag"". You will see more mini-lessons to cement this idea. \xa0Because I\'ll take pictures of me using one bag in different ways to kind of show that we\'re so used to thinking that the bag dictates how we must carry it. But often times you have way more flexibility and freedom in how you carry the bag. You just have to maybe not use the straps, for example. If you have multiple bags, then you can also rotate through them, as each bag is designed to load your body in a particular way. So when you use it as designed, when you use the straps in the way that you would maybe see featured on the advertisement for that bag, if you used every bag as designed, then you would just need a ton of bags to change up the way that you\'re using your body. \xa0But having a ton of bags and varying bags to me is like the opposite of minimalism. I personally look for a bag that functions well in at least a couple of different positions. So I have one single bag. It\'s kind of hard to explain. So this bag drapes across my body. So it goes over one shoulder, the straps cross my body with the bulk being at my hip. So it would be like a messenger bag but it\'s not that structured. It\'s very loose. It\'s kind of like if you just took a big blanket and wrapped up the corners so that you had volume at the bottom and straps up the side. So I like bags like that because they wad up into almost nothing when you travel. So if they\'re empty, they don\'t take up any space. Where an empty messenger bag, like the bag itself, takes up so much space. \xa0So I can wear that bag and easily change carrying positions from draping over the right side versus angling from the left side. I also gather the strap up in my hand and I hold the stuff that\'s in the bag with one single hand - so using my grip strength ... it\'s not draped over my wrists. It\'s literally me pinching - if you imagine again gather that blanket up by the four corners and grasping it so that your grasp was forming the bag, that is a, that\'s one of my favorite carries. So I like to vary my carry. And I like purchasing items, so if I\'m gonna buy something it\'s gonna be one thing that works in multiple ways so that it allows a lot of movement diversity. It doesn\'t cast me into one single bag use. And then I also have a small backpack, I think it actually was a kids\' backpack, that I\'ll use for long walks or hikes. And sometimes I\'ll put my little collapsible bag inside my backpack so if I get tired of carrying the bag loaded on to the frame of my body I can throw my backpack in my bag and go back to carrying it with my grip strength. So those are my two solutions, you know, so I\'m walking with people for a long time, so being able to carry food and water and other supplies, bags are great. But I tend to stick to the most uncomplicated design as possible. \xa0So thanks for that question. That was a great question. And PS, all of your questions are fertilizer for my thinking so do not hesitate to ask me a question by emailing ', '. ', 'But keep in mind that I might have already answered your question in a previous podcast- or not your question per se. \xa0If you have a question, ', "", use the search box. Use the search box from the blog. That will search the website differently than if you use the search box from the home page. Put in some keywords because I look for the questions that come in and I would say that 50% of the questions you are asking are answered with sometimes hour long explanations in the form of other podcasts. So if you have not worked your way through the hundred plus episodes, which I totally understand why you wouldn't have done that, you can at least start reading the show notes or listening to that podcast if you have something you want to know that's already been answered."", ""Ok.

I love academics and I Iove technical reading especially when it's really accessible and not jargon-heavy. So when I wanted to talk about action orientated items that get people moving in ways that they hadn't thought of, gardening and food consumption is a big part of that.

Thank you again for having me. I'm thrilled."", ""KATY: Before I left twitter your personal account, I don't know if it's your UC account, but you have this hashtag, the "", "" And I loved it because I feel like it sums up what I do. I'm a movement observer just as much as I'm a movement instructor. And I see movement and how it works everywhere. I see how various systems that are maybe off other people's radar of being movement related - as related to movement. So what does food observer mean to you?"", ""ROSE: Well, so that's really interesting about that question. So, my personal twitter handle is "", ', which is a riff off my interest and passion for the victory garden movement and the radical notion that we should have gardens everywhere and everyone should be gardening. So ', ' is my account that I created for the University of California, a digital platform called the ', "", in support of the University's global food initiative. And it's been really wonderful to be able to, as an academic, observe what's going on in the food system and basically curate content and then create original content that's designed to connect people with information and perspectives and ideas about all the topics that would involve the food system. Not only in the US, but internationally. \xa0\xa0Whether it's... well you know. Food touches everything."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""ROSE: And we're all stakeholders in the food system because most of us eat - several times a day. And it's political. It's social. It's historical. It's cultural. It's economic. \xa0Food is involved in all of these things."", 'KATY: Yeah. We had a guest on, ', ', whose work with the first nations in Canada, he has this statement where food is the spine or the axis of a culture. And I just was thinking about that - that indigenous perspective as I was reading your book because ', ' is really about using gardens as a political strategy. As a patriotic strategy. Which I just thought was, ""Wow, that is such a unique ..."" it was just a different perspective than I was used to hearing it. And it could be the circles that I move in but, gardening is becoming a thing - a new thing. And I have to just kind of laugh when I say that because from the historical perspective it\'s the opposite. We only see it as a new thing because of this brief window of human history where we haven\'t had - each one of us pulling the food off the land - cultivating it, you know, hunter/gathering in some way. I\'ve seen gardening coming up in various magazines as a new way to get fit. Just get a garden and do these exercises. And I\'ve seen farmers discuss starting farm fit programs to help people get complex exercise while helping them out with the labor that they really struggle to be able to do, especially on smaller farms. \xa0There\'s gardening as part of social justice initiatives. I\'m thinking of Ron Finley, his personal story.', 'ROSE: Right.', ""KATY: He grew up in a food prison. Growing food is like printing money is his statement. \xa0And then a couple months ago I read, there was Paul Quinn College. And it was a financially struggling institution and they decided to give up their football team, rip up their football field, and start an organic garden. I just want to read this to set the complexity of what we're talking about. \xa0"", 'This is what I have seen in the last few years. \xa0Rose, what have you seen that convinces you that gardens have the power to transform the world?', ""ROSE: Well, I've traveled a lot, not only in the United States but internationally. And gardens are a thing. And I think work like what Ron Finley is doing with the sort of radical nature of gardening in public or community spaces is really important. In the time that I've been working with gardens, we've seen the school garden movement just absolutely explode. \xa0And, you know, gardens are the first step, right? So you get a school garden and then maybe you get a farm to school program. And you get nutrition education in the classrooms. And so I'm seeing a lot of interest in gardens and a lot of interest in heirloom varieties. Which I find really hopeful in terms of people learning more about biodiversity and environmental health. And also, again, just sort of about food trailways. \xa0So I'm seeing a lot of interest in gardening and you know I look, for example, at the master gardener program in the state of California. And there are over 6,000 active master gardeners in California out there working with communities and these classes are packed across the United States. The master gardener classes are just packed. People are hungry for knowledge and people are also seeing gardening as a means of civic engagement. Which I think is absolutely critical and wonderful. It's really collaborative."", 'KATY: How did you get into gardening in the first place?', 'ROSE: So that\'s kind of a weird story. So my family did some gardening when I was a kid. My grandparents were from a rural area and then later ended up in a city, Jackson Mississippi. \xa0And they gardened. And really raised much of the food they produced. I remember being pretty surprised when I went with my grandfather to the grocery store on a visit in high school because his week\'s groceries were a small bag because he was going out fishing and then they had this big huge garden at their home. And I was pretty impressed with that. So I always did some gardening. And then I went to work for the University as a director of a 4-H program. And there was an adviser from Northern California named Dan Desmond who was my mentor. And he said, ""You know, a great foundation for a 4-H program would be to go garden-based education."" \xa0Because you\'re gonna hit all of these wonderful high points with kids and families about nutrition and stem and environment and stewardship and community service. And I became absolutely hooked. And so I started doing not only gardening programs with 4-H clubs, but also in school-based programs. And I led a school garden program at my daughter\'s school for 5 years because there were so many ways to weave it into the curriculum no matter what you were studying whether it was history or language arts or science or math. And got really hooked. And then my county didn\'t have a master gardener program. We were partnering with Santa Barbara County. And I went, wait a minute. Ventura County has huge demand. So I worked with, spearheaded, actually, with a group of my colleagues, an effort. And we started a Master Gardener program in Ventura County. And I was the Master Gardener adviser for four years. And then simultaneously in addition to sort of being a practitioner and a garden educator, I\'m a historian. And my research sort of collided with what I was actually doing with my hands every day. And I started learning about this rich history of sort of school/home/community gardening in America. But not only in America. All around the world. And then I started doing research about the history of sort of women in this sort of effort. \xa0And really got into it. And ended up writing a book about it.', 'KATY: Yeah. So hopefully everyone out there is feeling like, ""Ok, I want to grow something."" Or at least nodding their heads. And so we asked you to prepare three action items, actions that we can take now to get them going with gardening in some way. Getting them in the garden in some way. \xa0', ""ROSE: Well my first item is to get started. And that can be a small action. And I am inspired by the victory garden models of World War 1 and World War 2. Not the war part at all, but the gardening part. Gardens were front and center. Everywhere. And so the first action I'd like people to do is to start gardening and to make the garden visible. If you live in an area where you can garden year-round, garden in your front yard. \xa0I had, for a long time, a raised bed at the top of my driveway. Start a garden in your school. Start a garden on your median strip. For me making it visible is not only a way to increase interactions with people about gardening and spark conversations, but it also is a demonstration of your commitment to garden."", 'KATY: What was the motivation in the World War 1 and World War 2 programs to display your garden? Was it simply just to show that you were doing your part.', 'ROSE: Yes, it was absolutely. It was to show that you were committed. That you were doing your part. \xa0And sort of an acknowledgment of the collective nature of the effort, which was really important.', ""ROSE: I agree. That's a wonderful way to do it. And the knowledge and the expertise that's resident in community gardens is really helpful for people who might just be starting out gardening."", ""KATY: And a fun fact here. I live in a retirement community. \xa0And it's considered a low mobility area just because of the demographic. But we have low mobility community gardens. \xa0Meaning the whole garden has been scaled up so that you can do it comfortably without needing to bend too much or if they're all wheelchair friendly. So if you are thinking about creating a community garden, remember you can diversify the shape of your community gardens to meet the needs of more people who might want to be coming out there."", ""ROSE: So my next tip is if you live in a part of the country where outdoor gardening is more challenging during winter months, I actually have two tips within this one tip. One tip is to try container gardening inside. And maybe with herbs and greens and if you're gardening with kids, you can make a windowsill garden. And that's really easy to do. You get a recycled Ziploc bag. Put a bit of moistened soil with maybe some carrot seeds, and then tape it to a sunny window. And that's a really easy thing that you can do. The other thing that for people who are really ambitious, is to pick up a copy of "", ' about sort of extending your growing season. And the sort of gardening strategies and how-tos about how to maybe grow three seasons out of the year, even in climates that are colder.', ""KATY: I like that. We are fortunate to live in this weird microclimate that's got a really long growing season. But there's a couple limitations that I hear people protesting is: \xa0one is lack of space. So I think that your tip pertains not even to winter challenges but space challenges, right? I can do all the same things that you just said if space is an issue."", ""ROSE: Absolutely. Container gardens are absolutely wonderful. And I always have a couple of container gardens going on even though I don't have terrible space constraints. And I think that space is a big issue. But you can make a container garden with materials that you probably already have around your home or that you can get at a thrift store or pretty inexpensively. But they're also the containers or gardens are becoming much more high tech and I'm always amazed when I go on to a gardening website to see the sort of vertical tools that have been developed for people to grow vertically and it's really amazing to me what sort of containers are available now to sort of facilitate and help you adapt to small spaces."", ""KATY: Those are great tips. \xa0I was just thinking too. I have a pretty big container garden even though I have lots of space. I use some of my land space. But I just like containers. I can only get tomatoes to grow in this region because I built a small greenhouse made out of trash in the front of my house. And I find that it's easier for me to tend to things where I'm passing them already to get to other places. So my container garden is between me and where my washer and dryer is and between I and my car is. \xa0And so it's in a high traffic area and I just end up weeding small bits of time, watering small bits of time. So don't be daunted if you live in an urban setting or don't have lots of space. It's still possible."", ""ROSE: It is. And in fact, one of the best methods that I've used consistently over the last years is the square foot gardening model, which is also a great model to use with kids or if you're in a classroom setting. Where everyone gets a square foot. But one of the things that I've always done with container gardens to is that the scale of it might be that for a child that's learning about responsibility, they can be in charge of a container garden. And that's also a really rewarding exercise for them. \xa0"", ""My second tip is just, I think there are two hurdles to overcome when it comes to gardening. There's overcoming a lack of knowledge or experience but for many people, of course, I'm not a gardener again and I'm like in a body world, people will say that they can't bend, their hands don't grip very well, their knees hurt. So the idea of gardening, which it is, it's a physical activity, feels out of reach. It's another hurdle to overcome. So I would say to learn some great gardening form. Learn how to lift and carry well. Learn how to bend well. Learn a few hand stretches, how to play with your tools and your tool grip so that your time in the garden is not only nourishing you in the sense of the green space and the food that might come forth from it, but also your body is being moved well while you're doing it. I wrote a couple articles on this and I will put them into the show notes including a kind of general "", ' and less of your spine and knees. I will link to that so you can go practice it later.', ""ROSE: I'm gonna come back to something that you said which is a really critical point which is that a challenge for people who want to garden who maybe haven't gardened before is information. And there's a lot of information out there but sometimes it's hard to find. \xa0And I really want to encourage people who are interested in gardening, wherever they live, to visit their extension master gardener website. There is an extension master gardener program in every state and it's even gone international now. And this was a program, it starts out at the USDA, it's managed by the Land Grant University in every state. And it sort of rose up as a result of the environmental movement. It actually started in Washington State in 1972 and just caught on fire across the United States. And you will find the best gardening information for your region, your climate, your considerations and it's science-based. It's really really wonderful. The websites are packed full of information. And then the master gardener programs also do helplines. They do events in communities at nurseries, at farmers markets to provide information and absolutely wonderful program. And then the tip within that tip is that if you have kids and you want to garden with kids, I really encourage you to run over to the Junior Master Gardener website. And the junior master gardener program is one of my dear friends at Texas A&M University. It's an international program. And they have got books and tips and all sorts of things for gardening with kids. An absolutely wonderful website."", 'And ', "" a mentor. It doesn't have to be anyone who is a master or you don't only have to have a master gardener. I have found for me - so I would say I probably mentor a movement for many of you listening, but when it comes to all the other things that I want to do, I need someone who is already doing it better than me, more than me. And it doesn't have to be the person that's doing it the best, it just needs to be someone who has some experience or some tidbit that I can physically participate in. So when I say find a mentor, I usually mean that as a little bit different that find an expert. Because a mentor is usually someone who you can move shoulder to shoulder with because sometimes when a person is doing a thing that they've figured out how to do and then they write about it, they're leaving out steps that they might not even realize they're doing. So I've just found through great neighbors. I have a neighbor and I swear she's a master gardener. She says she's not. She says she's just learned through trial and error. But she'll always come over and she's maybe 5 years older than me but she kind of talks with "", ' of a person of 107. I\'ve found a bunch of winter squash plants that were already on the half dead but I got them for almost no money at our local farm store. So I was like, I\'m gonna throw these in the ground. And she walks by and she\'s like, ""Oh, squash hate wet feet."" \xa0And I was like, it was just a little line of wisdom. And squash ', ' wet feet is way easier for my brain to grasp a hold of ', "" to try to memorize all the things that plants need. So there's something to this just casual interaction. I mean it's not a parable by any means, but there's ... they're like memes. They're almost like memes. So I have found that learning for me has definitely been a hybrid of reading the books and the texts and then having someone else filter five simple lines. And then if you have a community of people that each "", ' their own version of ""squash hate wet feet"" then pretty soon I have this kind of strange reference system in my own head about what to water and what not to water. So find a mentor or seven who are all doing something slightly different in your area and see what happens.', ""ROSE: I think that is absolutely great. I learn more from other gardeners. It's amazing. And people come from different regions and different cultural traditions and people will also start giving you seeds, which is wonderful."", 'KATY: And just talking. If you are friends or you build friendships with various people where I might not have to remember my chart of what to plant. I have two friends who are gardening and they\'ll be like, ""Hey did you get your garlic in the ground."" And I\'m like, ""Oh right, garlic, it\'s got to be there in November. I totally forgot."" \xa0But they did it. And so it\'s just these casual lifestyle reminders that fit into the flow of life. And so, just like I have recently friended a fisherman who is going to start taking me out, friend some gardeners and just see what happens. Well, Rose, I really appreciate you coming on. Is there anything else? Any other bits of wisdom or memes you would like to share with us before you go?', ""ROSE: \xa0Well you know if your library has a copy of my book, please go grab it. It's really an interesting book. It's got a lot - it's not purely history. It's also got my kind of seven political planks about gardening and the food system in there. And another thing, too, that is in there that I think is pretty relevant right now, is I have a whole section on poster art and those wonderful, incredible food posters of World War 1 and World War 2 and propaganda. The propaganda that was used to promote gardening in World War 1 and World War 2 was positive for the most part. \xa0But it's really interesting to learn more about those posters. Probably you've seen those posters online and to learn more about the history of those posters, like the food commandments poster, is really fascinating."", 'KATY: You know this book is such a great book if you homeschool especially. I mean it\'s great for anyone but if you are thinking about trying to do a food unit on the history of food. There\'s so much nutrition and that\'s fine. But this is a whole different perspective. It\'s to really understand the food system and how we got to where we are today but there\'s this poster: \xa0Food: 1) Buy it with thought, 2) Cook it with care, 3) use less wheat and meat, 4) buy local foods, 5) serve just enough, 6) use what is left. And it just ends or concludes with ""don\'t waste it."" And this is from 1919. And when we talk about what we\'re spending money on as far as trying to get education across and figure out what\'s the best parameters, these simple guidelines have been around for so long and I don\'t know if we necessarily need to produce more guidelines or we just need to start heeding the ones that we have. And I think that that change, that personal change in behavior is so much more challenging than a call for just, ""well do we really need to buy it with thought? \xa0Let\'s just do more research on what thoughtful buying does."" I feel like we\'re in that loop of just wanting something that maybe is never coming that really mandates that we make certain or better choices for food system and for all. So anyway, I highly recommend it. You can find more about Rose Hayden-Smith at ', ' or on ', ' and Twitter. ', "". And you can find Rose's book: "", "" at your local library.

Glad to be here.', ""KATY: Yeah. I feel like we've talked a while in emails and texts because I was passing through your neck of the woods years ago. We were trying to meet up. You were sick or maybe I was sick or one of our kids was sick. I don't remember what it was but…"", 'TERRAL: Something like that.', 'KATY: I\'ve been wearing your shoes for years and it\'s been so fun to kind of be privileged enough to see the back end of the shoes. Everyone sees the front end on the website and they buy the shoes and they put them on but it\'s nice to get to work with shoemakers and furniture makers when they\'re trying to figure out how do we help people move more. So I am just fortunate to get to see a lof that process. And I want to share that process with our listeners. And I think this series - this kind of series within a series - has also turned into... it\'s not guidance counseling, as far as career goes, but I think that as kids and teenagers we think ""oh we\'re gonna go study something. And then we\'re gonna go get a job with that thing that we studied."" Like there\'s no wiggle room for changing who you are in the process or what you do in the process. And one theme that\'s been constant through these maker interviews is not one person, whether it was furniture or footwear, said: ""I\'ve had a lifelong passion for designing footwear."" Or, ""I went to study footwear design and thus this is what I do."" Everyone has this great kind of origin story. And you studied graphic design.', ""TERRAL: Yeah. Yeah, that's right."", 'KATY: How did you come to design and then how did you come to shoes.', ""TERRAL: \xa0Well, the one main thing that I learned while studying graphic design was problem-solving techniques. And so I feel like that really has contributed to my life a lot. So I don't regret what I went into at all. But I studied graphic design. I got a good job right out of college. And I live in a small town so there's only so many opportunities for that kind of work. And I had worked at a couple different places and I just didn't really feel like it was the best fit for me. I thought about going off on my own and doing freelance work. And that would require moving my family to a large city and we were struggling with do we want to stay here, do we want to live kind of in the country. And what do I do, what do I do for a living. And that's kind of right around the time that I just started tinkering around with making sandals. And I originally was just going to make them for myself because I was looking for a lightweight sandal that I could go backpacking with. I knew nothing about the concept of minimalist shoes until I started researching lightweight shoes. And then I discovered Vibram 5 fingers and everything just clicked and made so much sense to me. And I thought, yeah, I need this. But I still want sandals. So I'm still gonna make my own. And it was my wife's idea to take it and turn it into a business. And so, and that really that allowed me the freedom of living where I wanted to live. And so I thought, you know what? How many people get an opportunity to run a shoe business. Even if it fails, what a great education. And then it would allow me the freedom to live where I wanted to live, to do what I wanted to do rather than trying to sacrifice who I am to pursue what it is that I studied. So at that point, it made so much sense to just take off and do what I wanted to do."", 'KATY: So you get to do what you want to do which is always nice. But you decided to mass produce footwear for people so there must have been something about lightweight sandals ... whatever problem you were trying to solve within yourself as far as why you needed lightweight sandals when you were backpacking whether it just felt better or you just craved this feeling. How did this work become important to you - making footwear?', ""TERRAL: I think when it really became important to me was when I actually learned about the benefits of minimal footwear and when I learned about how our feet really work. I've always been the type of person that I wear sandals more than shoes. I go barefoot when I can. And I couldn't always explain it but it felt right to me. And so when I was able to put information with feelings that I already had inside, I just felt that this is important. This is what people need."", 'KATY: What have you learned about your customers? What do they want? What are they looking for?', 'TERRAL: The customers have shifted over the years. When I first started doing this I literally knew nothing about business, nothing about marketing, really nothing about anything.', 'KATY: Your logo is really great though. Did you do your own logo?', 'TERRAL: I did. Thank you. \xa0I knew how to make a logo.', 'KATY: There you go.', ""TERRAL: So yeah, I just started doing it and the book Born to Run had just come out and lots of people were running barefoot and so that was my customer base right at that moment. But that was never really who we marketed to. My goal in making UnShoes was to make a minimalist sandal that looked more normal. At the time there were only two other companies offering minimalist sandals and they were very very primitive, which I had nothing against but I wanted to have something that was a little bit more sporty looking. something that looked a little more modern. So I started figuring out how to integrate these thin minimal soles with climbing webbing. And now that's pretty normal. It's in most minimalist sandals and there's' nothing extraordinary about that. But that's what made us stand out just enough to propel us into a different audience which were people that were really wanting to change their lifestyle in a healthier way."", ""KATY: Yeah, I'm nodding because that is so true. I think we share some origin story in the fact that barefoot running - I mean I'm not going to say widespread phenomenon because it's still pretty niche, but it's a thing now that people understand. And it was, you know, it really started with running. But there was hardly anyone making footwear. And then now we've got way more companies and I wonder, if you have more companies vying for this kind of niche market but at the same time as it went from running or athleticism to lifestyle, and almost everyone has got more than one pair of shoes for their lifestyle. Maybe one pair of running shoes but multiple pairs of shoes for their lifestyle, it's really great that we have so many companies. Because I wear a lot of minimal footwear and have for 10 years and every shoe style fits differently. \xa0We can say that all feet are anatomically the same at that the bulk of their features distribution wise are similar across the board but feet are so individual. Lengths of toes, and state of training, that I really appreciate having so many options."", ""TERRAL: And from a maker point of view, I'm glad there are a lot of other companies too because we can't make everything for everyone."", 'KATY: Right.', ""TERRAL: So I'm grateful for that."", 'KATY: Yeah. It allows you to kind of do what you do really well. And then at the same point, I can see - I imagine if you start a shoe company that makes sandals or if you start a sandal company, eventually you become a footwear company because people love you and they love your brand and they\'re like, ""Great. What else you got besides sandals?"" \xa0So, what else you got? That\'s my question for you.', 'TERRAL: \xa0Yeah, that\'s exactly what happened. Because for one thing we were busy in the summer and then winter would come around and we were like, ""All right. Let\'s do something."" \xa0And then a lot of people would ask us for some other kind of solution. They\'d say, ""I can\'t wear my old shoes anymore. I want you guys to make something warmer."" So we kind of thought, what\'s the next step between sandals and regular minimalist shoes and we thought, moccasins. So we started off making moccasins. We have a whole line of those. And then we\'ve recently started making a shoe called Terra Vida which is a canvas slip-on shoe. It\'s extremely light. I almost hesitate to call it a shoe because it\'s so minimal.', 'KATY: A foot covering?', ""TERRAL: A foot covering, yeah. The nice thing about that one is that it looks pretty normal. \xa0So what people like about that is it looks kind of like a Tom's shoe style but it's extremely minimal. Also, we have our new Wildflower series which is both sandals and close-toed shoes. Right now we just have the two models but we will be adding more eventually as we move forward with those. \xa0I realize I should clarify what the Wildflower series is."", 'KATY: Yeah. Tell us what that is.', ""TERRAL: The Wildflower series is a line of shoes designed for women to look at little bit nicer. I don't want to say formal, but more formal than for example our Wachova feather sandals. So we're using metallic leathers and stuff like that. So they're really designed to allow women to kind of look nicer, to feel nicer when they go out on a date or something like that but not feel like they have to cram their feet into their old high heels or something like that. So we want people to be healthy no matter what activity they're doing."", 'KATY: Yeah. I started this project and then I immediately abandoned it because I thought I don\'t think I have the bandwidth to do this project but it was to access, if we compartmentalized or named the category of shoes. I get a lot of people going, ""I\'ve tried your shoe list but I need it for this ..."" This situation which is ... work. There\'s so many categories of footwear and it is so hard because none of those categories is across the board. So what is professional for one person would not cut it for another person\'s version of professional. And then there\'s dress, and there\'s dress casual and on and on. And that\'s when I jumped ship. I\'m out. But it seems to be that a big complaint from my readers was we kind of found that there was two holes. We found that there was a lack of children\'s minimal shoes that were, I\'ll say school appropriate but what I really meant was schools don\'t often allow open-toed sandals. So it was not appropriate - not the right word - it\'s like that met certain school requirements. That was a big hole a few years ago. It\'s been since somewhat filled in although I think some of the companies that are doing it are outside of the US and then other people are going I\'m trying to buy within North America because they\'re coming from overseas. And then the other one was, what do you call it? The dress shoes? \xa0It\'s date night shoe? I don\'t know.', 'TERRAL: Yeah.', 'KATY: \xa0So for me, I wear Unshoes 100% of the time and feel perfectly comfortable with it. I have no problem wearing a minimal sandal as part of my date night. So subjective.', 'TERRAL: YEAH.', ""KATY: But I know what you mean. When you're feeling the need to adorn, there's not a lot of options out there if you're looking for, I don't know, styles are so individual and what we crave to dress ourselves up with - it just helps the more options there are. So that's Wildflower, yes?"", ""TERRAL: Yes. That's Wildflower."", 'KATY: What other things do you see farther down the line', '?', ""TERRAL: So we have some other projects that we have thought about creating and we've kind of worked on here and there. We really try to listen to customer feedback so some of the things - you already mentioned the kid's shoes - that is one of them. We currently make sandals for kids but we don't have any closed toe options so we are considering maybe creating something for that. The challenge with kids shoes is that having a smaller thing doesn't necessarily make it cheaper. In fact with shoes it's actually more expensive. Because it's more difficult to make."", ""KATY: Yeah. We talked about that last time. The expectation of less material and just the fact that we're not used to... kids go through shoes more quickly because they grow more rapidly and it's harder to see the investment if you're looking at it ... if you're looking up the value per shoe versus per minute of development, the investment doesn't seem to be there. But if you look at it the other way then the investment might be never more important that it is, right? In that first - I mean our skeletons are really shaping all the way through 16-18, maybe, depending. So children's shoes and what else?"", ""TERRAL: And our goal with the children's shoes really is to come up with a design that is simple - as simple as possible for us to make so that we can offer it at a price point where people can afford it but we can still, you know, feed our families at the end of the day too."", ""KATY: How do you do that? \xa0Are you trying out different models? \xa0You say it like that's what we have to do and everyone nods. It's like right, they're doing that. What does that look like? Does that look like you trying a bunch of materials? Styles? Wearing them? What does figuring that outlook like?"", ""TERRAL: Yeah, well that's something I've learned a lot about is efficiency and how to do this without breaking the bank because it can get expensive really fast. So the first thing I look at is, ok, how are we actually putting this together. What's the overall pattern? How many seams do we have to sew? How much glue do we have to use? How many people do we have to employ to be able to put this thing together? And then we start thinking how many of these things are just expected and how many are actually necessary. So there's value added and nonvalue added. And we've studied lean manufacturing Toyota. We've tried to just cut out anything that's not value adding, any waste. Making things as efficient as possible. So with designing a shoe, we're really trying to keep it as simple as possible. So to start up we make mockups so that's sometimes paper. My kids are often walking around with paper wrapped around their feet. Or tape. Or socks that have been taped up. Anyways - so just kind of moves from there. We try materials. We try a lot of different things. So it can take some time."", ""KATY: Wow. \xa0I have never once looked at my footwear and counted seams but I guess you're right. The more amount of separate pieces, all of those things, are what a manufacturer is having to consider."", ""TERRAL: Yeah. And there's what can we automate and what uses a human brain. So anything that you can automate is faster but it's not always as reliable. So."", ""KATY: All right. So children's shoes. Anything else in the pipe?"", ""TERRAL: Yeah. Another thing that people have asked us for is a women's, I say women's because most of the people that have asked have been women, it's really who our audience is. \xa0A boot for fall/winter weather. So that's, you know, that's when you look at what we originally came from, sandals, it's a big leap. There's a lot of different things that go into that so it's something we've been working on for a while but we haven't really gone very far if that makes sense."", ""KATY: So if you're UnShoes, what's the theme across all your shoes. So you've always done sandals for the most part and then added. So is the theme just minimalism throughout or is there some other identifier of your product that's in your mission statement that's also embodied in your shoes?"", ""TERRAL: That's a good question. The one thing that's a unifier is that we take an ancient design concept, something that has been around for a very long time. Something that's been proven. Something that's usually pretty simple in design to start out. We started out with huaraches, you know, the basic sandals. And then we take it and we say ok, how can we make this a little bit more modern? How can we apply it to something that looks a little bit more up to date without losing the simplicity of the design? And in some cases how can we add simplicity or I guess simplicity isn't added it's taken away. Complexity is taken away. Right?"", 'KATY: Right. \xa0Minimalism or maximalism. Which is it?', ""TERRAL: So that's the one thing that we've done all across the board. Moccasins: here's the basic primitive mocassin. How can we make it look more like a shoe without turning it into a shoe? So every product that we have has that as the root of it. And then the other thing in our mission statement is that everything we do we are trying to create footwear that it doesn't do something for your foot, it allows your foot to do its thing. So we're trying to get out of the way as much as possible."", 'KATY: Well, similarly boots, casual boots. Casual adults boots are kind of that other plea. \xa0And I have shoe lists, footwear lists on my website. And every winter I come back to last year\'s winter list. \xa0And it\'s like why winter list? Because people are looking for boots. And the adult minimal boot choices are abysmal. They barely exist. And if they do exist, they tend to not return the next year because I think a lot of times footwear companies are having to meet a design need. Right? Because then you need to buy all the different colors or all the shapes and do-dads. And so yes, please. Let me know when that boot is available and I will share it with all of our readers because they\'re the ones who are asking and they\'re asking me. And I\'m like, ""I don\'t know. I write books about feet. I don\'t know anything about making shoes."" So you do. So you\'ve heard the people.', ""TERRAL: All right. Great. Excellent. So that's good to hear. And if any of your listeners want to connect with us, send us messages, we would love to hear their feedback. That's really everything we do is based on customer feedback. One thing about with boots is that there are, even within boots, there's a lot of variation of what's expected and what people want. Like you were talking about with fancier footwear. One thing we probably will not do is like fully waterproof winter boots."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""TERRAL: \xa0That's a little outside of our realm at this point in time. So they would be more like casual, warm weather, you're not going to step in 6 inches of slushy snow or something. Just putting that out there."", 'KATY: Yeah. But at the same time, people in many places of the world for thousands and thousands of years have put their self-made footwear in those conditions. And so, for me, I live in the Pacific Northwest. We have snow. This is not Montana. This is not Wisconsin.', 'TERRAL: Wisconsin. Yeah.', 'KATY: Or Nova Scotia - places where people are shaking their fists at me right now with me talking about my ""winter"" with air quotes around it. And I fully get that but at the same time, I don\'t feel the need for Wisconsin improved weather gear in my rain and snow. I have adapted with being less comfortable by pairing wool socks, sometimes a couple of pairs with my nonwater resistant but I can still put beeswax on them. I can seal them in myself. So I end up getting wet. But I end up being warm wet. And so I\'m ok being wet because I\'m not after being perfectly comfortable. I\'m after doing what footwear has always done for many many years which is give us an added boost of protection. Not to make us impermeable, or impervious to nature. \xa0Like it\'s raining. It\'s wet. And I\'m gonna let some of that wet in my feet and I have a fire and I will take care of it later. And it\'s like the safety guidelines of myself and plus moving around a lot keeps you warm. And so I can hear what you\'re making which is not rain boots. Like that\'s not what you\'re making.', 'TERRAL: Yes. Exactly.', ""KATY: Well, I can say again, if you want to take some of my feedback and tape up your kids' calves appropriately with the boots is, there is a wide variance in calf shape. So I'm just here to just throw that out there to you or anyone else considering making boots. And that seems to be the biggest limiting factor. Human timeline is pretty long but even if we went like shod humans, boots and wrapping things around our feet and shanks which is a way a biomechanist would define the lower leg, the shin, the shank area. So how can we take that kind of ancestral practice and make it so that everyone's calves can fit within boots? There's something to a design. You're the graphic designer. So there'd be some type of fold and buckle that would really allow it to change shape because that is the biggest thing. When you get into boots you're not only dealing with the variance in foot shape - and I know you know about that."", 'TERRAL: \xa0Yes.', ""KATY: I know you know about the variance in foot shape because I've seen - how many templates do you have for foot shape?"", ""TERRAL: So we have 6 templates that we use for our custom foot shapes. And we've kind of gone away from that a little bit. Where we have you go on the website and just buy our standard size. And that actually fits most people well enough. But for those who do want custom sizes, there's still that opportunity."", ""KATY: There's that with calf shape. So I don't know how there would be something in stretch or something with stringing and creative folding. So just putting it out there. \xa0Because I receive a lot of boot shape feedback even though I myself am nor a boot make or a shoemaker. It comes my way. So I'm just handing it over to you as a bootmaker."", 'TERRAL: Perfect.', 'KATY: And it has landed, everyone who has emailed me. It has landed.', ""TERRAL: I will take that information and use it. It's actually great feedback."", ""KATY: You will use it. I don't think it's something that everyone thinks about all the time. Right? I'm pre-thinking it for you. Or rather many other people are have pre-experienced it and we're preloading your design pipe. \xa0Ok. Is there anything else you want to tell our listeners."", ""TERRAL: No I think that's it. We are working towards these new designs. They might take some time. I don't want people to think that they're gonna come out next month. Because it is a time-consuming process."", 'KATY: Sure.', ""TERRAL: But yeah. Another thing that I might add in too is with our Wildflower series, for those who may have followed us for the last 5 years or so, we actually launched our Wildflower series once before and we did a Kickstarter campaign and that was successful but we weren't ready to do that. It was a big failure and we learned a lot from it. So we didn't have suppliers in place. Some of the materials that we were using ended up failing. A lot of the sandals ended up failing. We lost money on that project, despite the fact that the campaign was successful. It actually almost put us under - it was close to tipping the boat over. But we made it through and so we have taken what we have learned from that experience and now we have re-launched the Wildflower series with all that in mind and we're moving forward with confidence. So we're happy to do that."", 'KATY: Well, to err is human, yeah?', 'TERRAL: Yes.', 'KATY: And we all know what forgiving is.', ""TERRAL: Having a business has really taught me what failure is and that it is an opportunity. It's not something to beat yourself up over, so, that has been a wonderful opportunity for me to learn."", ""KATY: Well parenting pretty much did that for me.

Welcome to the Katy Says podcast. This is the fifth in a series of special episodes that we are calling Between the Lines. In this series Katy Bowman and Stephanie Domet explore the deeper messages in, and connections between Katy's books."", ""KATY: \xa0I'm Katy B., biomechanist and author of "", '.', ""STEPHANIE: And I am Stephanie D., a chronically curious writer and radio journalist. Katy, I think we should say a little bit about this series because here we are 5 episodes in. Some newcomers might not know what we're up to. So, we're thinking of these Between the Lines episodes as kind of book club. Why did you want to offer a series of conversations specifically about your books?"", 'KATY: \xa0Well, I think that my books reflect the greatest source of my ideas. I wrote blog posts for so long and they\'re kind of, there\'s a ton of information on the blog, just like there is in the podcast. \xa0But they\'re not particularly connected, so I\'m not sure ... I mean, I\'ve had a lot of people feedback and say, ""I love the short form. I love walking away from a blog post or an episode with one single piece of information."" So I think that there\'s many people who find value in the short form. And then you could also say that maybe some of my books, because there\'s so many, there are 8, so the number alone I would say, lends itself to doing a book club. \xa0Because that\'s a pretty large number of books. I mean I don\'t even know if there are that many Twilight books. \xa0Are there 8 in the Twilight...', ""STEPHANIE: You're asking the wrong guy."", 'KATY: Yeah, yeah, sorry. \xa0', 'STEPHANIE: Katy Bowman: more prolific than Stephenie Meyer.', 'KATY: You even know the name.', ""STEPHANIE: I mean, I'm just good. I know my stuff."", 'KATY: \xa0So, if you would look at all the titles going across you\'d be like, ""Huh - ', ', there\'s a couple of foot books. \xa0There\'s something about... there\'s some movement stuff going on..."" but they seem really, perhaps, unrelated if you were to just look at the covers of all of them. Which we\'ve been warned not to do, but, maybe we do anyway. So I thought, especially for people who have trained extensively with us in our training program and for people who\'ve been following for a long period of time, there\'s a lot of meat in these books. So the books could each be said to be like many blog posts and many podcast episodes assembled into one long thread. But the books themselves, these seemingly unrelated books, when you assemble them together you get an even larger picture. \xa0But that\'s reading 8 books. And that\'s reading 8 books close to each other while also maybe reading blog posts and listening to the podcasts. \xa0And I think in such, like, one kind of global way that I see every single thing that I\'ve ever put out, including articles that I\'ve written for other publications, I see them all as one body of work. And so if you\'re missing half of that, it\'s kind of like, ""Huh, I don\'t really get this one thing."" \xa0And it\'s like yeah that\'s because it\'s buried in this one book called ', "" and you're a 27-year-old dude and you didn't know that there was anything for you in that book. So I thought that, well, I can do the work. I can do that work for everyone listening. It's like no assembly required. Perhaps I could do some of it and so maybe people who had listened to one or two episodes or more, or who read a couple of books could see that. We get a tremendous number of questions. Tremendous. \xa0And I would say that 99.9% of them are answered in the material that I've put out. Meaning that answer is already available and assembled, but it's not easy to see until you pass through it. And I don't expect anyone to pass through it without realizing why they might want to. So that's the reason for the book club. It's like I'll assemble, I'll weave some of the tapestry for you here. You and I can do that together. And then, I think, then those little bits that you're trying to impart in your life, the practical, I think that once your mind has shifted to grasp some of the different, the other concepts, the practical becomes even easier. \xa0And you're finding that there's more space for the practical now that you see where you could go by doing so. So that's the intention."", ""STEPHANIE: And so far we've talked about "", ' and ', ' as they relate to each other. And there will be lots more, I think, on ', "" to come. We've talked about "", "" We've talked about "", '. And so today I thought we should tackle your two foot books: \xa0', ' and ', '. \xa0', 'KATY: Exactly.', 'STEPHANIE: Ok.', ""KATY: One for each foot. I didn't want anyone to be left out. \xa0Wouldn't that be funny if I wrote This is the Book for Your Right Foot?"", 'STEPHANIE: Ever more specialized.', 'KATY: And This is the Book for Your Left Foot. \xa0Well, if I had to write part by part it would take a long time.', 'STEPHANIE: (laughs)', ""KATY: But two foot books because I, I mean I guess two reasons. \xa01) There's a lot of parts in a small area. So if you're gonna go with the move more/move more of you, which we tackled in I think "", '. \xa0Since most of us are shod, a one-word way of saying have always worn shoes, it means that it\'s a tremendously sedentary area. And so for me starting with the foot brings about the greatest reward because it is maybe the most sedentary area on your body, even if you are super duper athletico. \xa0It would still be, if you have been shod, maybe the most sedentary area on your body. So it\'s just a tremendous results potential. \xa0That\'s not the reason that I wrote it, but anytime anyone asks me, ""where do I start"", I always say start with your feet because yes it is your foundation. There\'s not really many motions that don\'t initiate or pass through your feet. So if you\'re trying to work on your calves or your knees or your hips or your spine or your pelvis or your lower back or your neck, mechanically speaking the foot is, we say, setting the platform or being the foundation. But those are being very sedentary to me. I think of a platform and a foundation as being fixed.', 'STEPHANIE: Right. Solid blocks.', ""KATY: Exactly. And I don't know if we want to keep saying that because it's really more like, I think it's more like when you launch a ship, that platform that the shuttle is moving from is moveable. Right? It's coming in and it's coming out. So you're launching your movements from this platform and imagine if the shuttle platform wasn't all flat and level, but slightly tipped one way, how that would affect the entire trajectory of the shuttle. \xa0So it's like your launching pad for every single movement is highly sedentary, has lost its strength. Has lost its malleability. So it means that every move -if you've got this super complex - there's 33 joints in each foot - 25% of the number of muscles and bones in your body are from the ankle down. I've said this over and over again."", 'STEPHANIE: And it blows my mind every time.', 'KATY: It is. Because it\'s one-quarter. \xa0One-quarter of the positions available to your body start in the feet. If your feet can only get into one or two positions, all of that nuanced movement is lost. Which means you\'re launching point for all other motions is reduced down to those two positions. So you\'re moving exponentially less because of your immobile feet. \xa0So it\'s kind of like a no-brainer to start there because it not only helps you move more, you\'re moving way more of you every time you launch but secondly, people are saying, ""I don\'t have much time really."" \xa0', 'STEPHANIE: Uh huh.', 'KATY: ""If I\'m looking for a way to be a non-exercise mover, what do I do."" It\'s like put something different on your feet than what you\'re putting on now. \xa0That is really casting your entire body. \xa0That\'s why for ', "" - I wrote Every Woman's Guide to Foot Pain Relief was my first book. It is now "", "". It's been slightly updated and..."", 'STEPHANIE: Because dudes have foot pain too.', ""KATY: Well and exactly. And I originally wrote it as both but they're like, women have at least statistically what's been researched, more foot pain... it was like 1 in 4 women have such great foot pain that they can't move the rest of their body. Meaning that they have to be on rest. \xa0It's very interesting. \xa0I went to a women's gathering group."", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', ""KATY: For a weekend for a retreat. \xa0And there weren't very many, you know, it was 600 women, just statistics wise. There weren't very many, as far as injuries, there were no casts or braces, so I'm scanning with my eyes. That's where this data is about to come from. And I saw 14 women with foot immobilizing casts. Like would have a foot fracture soft cast."", 'STEPHANIE: Huh. \xa0Fourteen?', ""KATY: Fourteen. \xa0And these are women who have come to do, it was all in the woods, bumpy ground, and they were gonna suck it up and do it anyway. But I was like that's so interesting to me that of all, 100% of the visual injuries I were seeing were all of one foot. Very common for foot fractures and it's a very common injury. \xa0And you see, and they're young women. It's not an older person's injury by any means. They're active, they're runners...so you just see it over and over again. It just stuck out to me like, wow, look at all the foot casts on this group of, you know at least active in the forest women."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: Where there's nothing else. There's no wrists, there's no broken arms, there's no back braces. There's just the foot - one on one foot. \xa0So the reason that I wrote "", 'was for that. You know out of all of the questions that I would get, multi-generational - when it was one particular group it was pelvic floor always, but multi-generational it was always the feet or if someone was like, ""What about my pelvic floor?"" I\'d be like, ""Well do this."" \xa0And they\'d be like, ""Oh I can\'t do that because my ankles don\'t move.""', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: And I was like, ""Ok...so then what I\'m gonna give you for your pelvic floor, we have to start with the feet."" \xa0So it\'s like a hybrid of the fact that it\'s problematic ... the feet are problematic for so many people to the extent that it\'s casted or made sedentary more than just the foot. It\'s really such an easy place to start and so many people coming for knee, hip, back, pelvic floor, you know, and they\'re coming for exercises to mobilize the rest of their body. Once we got them moving their feet differently and standing upon their feet differently they didn\'t even have to do anything for their back or their pelvic floor because it was like, when your feet are moving with the rest of your legs, that takes care of moving these other parts that, for example, the pelvic floor, that you\'re just standing and clenching in isolation.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: That's a movement that comes because you're passing over your foot in a particular way. But we don't think of the pelvic floor as related to how the foot is articulating with the ground. \xa0So that's why feet. It's just like, I don't think there's not anyone who wouldn't be informed or made more mobile by working through those books."", 'KATY: \xa0Mmm.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. That just, I copied it out of the e-book and pasted it into a document to ask you about later. And it seems to me after our ', ' conversation that that feels very ', ""to me. \xa0How crucial a point is this to understand in what you're ultimately saying about feet and what we put on them and how we use them."", ""KATY: It's so critical. It's also, to me that sentence is about movement: The difference between exercise and movement. \xa0You know, when you put something on your feet in the morning, you're not exercising. \xa0It's not exercising based on how you walk in the shoe that you put on but you are being moved by the shoes that you put on. \xa0And because we don't think in terms of movement but only exercise, we don't think in terms of cellular deformation. And so that sentence is about you're being moved all day long from the ground up. Your environment is moving you. Your footwear is your environment. And so that's why... I don't even know if that particularly comes across because in "", ' I still have to work at the level where - in the next book where it will be basically calling out non-exercise movement in clarifying that you\'re being shaped by your environment. \xa0And I think people can get the fact that the terrain that you\'re walking on is uphill or downhill or it\'s bumpy or slippery. They can get those external pieces because, in my examples, you\'re moving over them. \xa0So, therefore, it kind of still relates to exercise a little bit because your arms and legs are going but simply putting on footwear is pushing on you. \xa0And so if you picked up a weight and did a particular set of exercises you would know that that would mean that this muscle is gonna grow over here and this one is going to atrophy. Like we\'ve got this sense of form in exercise. \xa0Your personal trainer helps you work with your form because you\'re trying to eek out a particular shape. It\'s like, but you\'ll slap anything on your foot not realizing that that\'s the movement that you chose to do all day and that you\'re pushing and pulling cells and putting muscles over here and letting other muscles atrophy over here or down to the bone level or the nerve health level, the skin level, that all these tissues, just like you\'re at the gym. You\'re growing and shaping them and you maybe didn\'t even know it. \xa0And for people, you know, I\'m always interested in what the fitness sector is in to because that group, in particular, has already made this decision: ""I\'m going to use the mode of exercise to push my body around to a particular experience."" \xa0It\'s the people in pain who are not regularly given access to the idea that their environment and the way that they\'re moving through it can be relating to that. \xa0And so it was like, you\'ve got this, you know, you\'re creating a high-pressure situation here. Can you back up off of that pressure situation and maybe let these tissues adapt to something different. \xa0And, again, the reason that trillion body thing is so important is what you put on your feet isn\'t only affecting you from the ankle down.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: It\'s not about, it\'s not only about foot pain. It\'s easiest, I would say, to say, ""Hey your foot\'s bothering you. Let\'s look at what\'s on your feet."" It\'s different to say, ""Hey, you have chronic tension in your neck? \xa0Let\'s look at what\'s on your feet."" \xa0You know. Even though the distance isn\'t that great between the two, but to explain a set of forces being created. You know, well, there\'s this thing called angular acceleration. When you put this on your foot, if you raise the heel above your toe all the time, that\'s creating a particular tension in the lower part of the body which kind of slows the lower part of the body down relative to the upper body. So you walking that shoe is the same mechanics as a whiplash injury in a car only you get one with every step but at very low speed so the effects compound.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh-huh.', 'KATY: So I get into that later on but I feel like the first level is, ""Did you know that what you put on your foot is affecting the rest of your body?"" And I think that\'s radical for a lot of people initially. So yeah, it does relate back to the cellular well being because we think of injury as, again, a foot injury, a back injury, whatever. We don\'t necessarily think of it as just cellular behavior. Because it has a name and a code on your insurance that it, well a lot of these things are just cellular phenomenons when you break them down. Movement can be a cellular phenomenon and a bulging disc can be a cellular phenomenon as well. So it just kind of breaking everything down in a slightly smaller level and saying everything you do matters. Starting with what\'s on your feet.', 'KATY: Right.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Ok.', ""KATY: Yeah, deformed just means to have the shape be changed. And so that's movement. That's what movement is. It's a change in shape. If there is no deformation there is no movement. "", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Ok. So I'm aiming for deformation here."", ""KATY: Yes. And constant different deformations, right? \xa0Because that means that you're moving in a lot of different ways. You're moving a lot."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Just having one deformation over and over again, that kind of stops being movement because it's just static in a different position. Like the differences between such a long... over such a long period of time, it stops being recognized as a difference. \xa0So yes, you want cellular deformation - deformations, maybe. "", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Okay.', 'KATY: So implying change.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0And then the other thing is one of the first things you said in this conversation is it was about your feet being sedentary. So even if you are, like a long distance runner and you're running, I don't know, how many miles a week does a long distance runner run? \xa0But you're doing it in a sort of traditional built up running shoe, your feet are moving over the earth but they're not moving in that shoe necessarily. And so then they're sedentary even though they're tracking x number of miles."", 'KATY: Yeah, like the feet, it all depends on how you think of the feet. \xa0If you think of them as just one thing being displaced over the earth, it\'s like, ""My feet have been moved."" \xa0It\'s like well there\'s another way of looking at it which is, the part within the foot moving relative to each other and in that case it would be sedentary. So it all depends on how you are defining these terms. But yeah, you can be in a shoe that immobilizes you and then you can be selecting terrain that further immobilizes you.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0\xa0A running shoe on a hard paved path.', ""KATY: On a hard paved flat path. You know, like, there's so many different variables that eek out movement. And then to say like you can be in something malleable. You could be in a, you could be barefoot. Maybe you're a barefoot runner but you are barefoot on flat paved... you're still gonna have large elements of sedentarism within the foot because you've eliminated grade and texture and so your terrain is void of parts that would deform the parts of your foot. And so, therefore, you could still even unshod, still be sedentary."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Okay!', ""KATY: Less so than when you're wearing a stiff shoe but it's all a continuum."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Because it's still your environment that you're putting that foot in."", ""KATY: Sure. \xa0You're being moved from the outside, often times."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. Okay. All right. So let's look at these two books. Who would you say "", ' is for?', ""KATY: \xa0It's definitely a lay person book. I wrote it with my grandmother in mind who had a debilitating - had beautiful feet and debilitating foot pain. And has since gone on to numerous joint replacements. But I just kind of wrote it for her. It's kind of, it's fun, you know. I keep everything that I write very light, I would say. It's \xa0jargon free for the most part. \xa0Except for a few key terms. I mean it's like the first toe, the second toe, the third toe, the fourth toe. It's very accessible."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: \xa0It's also, that being said, I would say that the information within it would be helpful to even, I mean is it number 1 in podiatry. It's in the top 10 in podiatry."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0It's a number 1 bestseller in podiatry since the day it came out."", 'KATY: Yeah, and I had a lot of podiatrists review it and say, ""This is great."" \xa0Because it doesn\'t have to be jargon rich to be new or novel or good scientific information. \xa0Good anatomical information. Just because I\'ve chosen to leave the words out that are inclusive only to a few who have had a particular training. \xa0The ideas are sophisticated. \xa0So lay person doesn\'t mean easy or dumbed down. \xa0\xa0It just simply means that I\'ve pinged myself. Not pinged at all.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0No don't do that."", 'KATY: \xa0No, no no no. \xa0I\'ve just thoughtfully made it for the people who I think need it the most. Which is the person out there with no anatomical background at all who was like, ""Oh, I can lift my first toe?"" \xa0', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. These things can work independently of each other? \xa0What?', ""KATY: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. \xa0Which I've seen people teach feet and they're teaching them so complicated and no one but people already interested in movement are even gonna grasp that."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: \xa0And so it\'s just real simple. It\'s simple things you can do in a chair. I mean I made it for people who aren\'t quite as mobile. But again athletes or like people who are excellent movers are like, ""I learn a lot from that book."" \xa0I would say that ', "" has greater content about shoes. I go into shoe anatomy more. \xa0So it's really a good counterpart to "", ' where you get more into feet and gait. \xa0Where ', ' is like, ""ok, here\'s how to really understand what I\'m talking about as far as the parts of a shoe so that you can then go out and change elements of your footwear by choosing to buy something..."" \xa0Playing around. Like you learn what does an upper do? \xa0Because maybe there\'s an aspect of the shoe that you require...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: So you can't go minimal all the way but there's 3 other elements or 4 other elements that you can play with. So it just makes - it makes you more aware that you get to choose the amount of casting you put on your foot. Or the way that you're being casted so that you can let it work for you. You can get the benefit of the shoe while still getting the benefit of foot movement. \xa0Right? So that's my end goal."", 'KATY: Well, it doesn\'t give permission to balance. \xa0Because I think, like a good dietitian, I don\'t think will say that you can balance off, I use this example a lot, you can balance off a creme brulee with a salad. It doesn\'t work that way. It\'s all input. \xa0However, if you have, if you love these shoes and these shoes are bringing you joy and you identify with them so strongly that to let them go would thwart you from thinking about that you can take better care of your feet - that\'s what the book is saying. It\'s like if you - it\'s like if you work at a desk job, like your shoes are also your desk job. \xa0I\'ve never said you have to quit your desk job. I might have implied it a couple of times. \xa0But I\'m not gonna state it outright. But it\'s just more like, it\'s not about balance, it\'s at looking at the nontime that you\'re doing the thing and making sure that you\'re moving more during that time. So if you have, I did so much publicity for that book when it first came out which was right around the holiday time. \xa0And if you go back through the archives like on Facebook you can see these articles. I did so many articles for the high heel hangover. \xa0Which is, I was doing a lot of PR in New York City where everyone is wearing...I shouldn\'t say everyone... well everyone that I saw in the magazine industry, were rocking like 3-4 inch heels. \xa0They were all in their 20s and early 30s and had only been wearing these shoes for a short time. Professionalism - they associate professionalism with this particular set of footwear and they\'re setting the trends and they just couldn\'t do an article - never - to say that the shoes, the heels weren\'t \xa0really helping you on x, y, z. \xa0Every article had to be about balancing the fact that you wanted to wear them with ""well what do I do in the morning.""', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right because my feet are killing me.', 'KATY: Exactly. So I was like you wouldn\'t write about any other health input like, ""Oh my gosh I gorged myself on ice cream last night. Like a tub and a half, 2 tubs. What do I do the next day?"" You know and then they give advice, they give purging. It\'s like purging. Like there\'s a belief that you can actually purge. So I don\'t like to reinforce that mindset because I find it a very dangerous mindset. To believe that you purge off behaviors that you know are, by your own data collection, doing you harm. \xa0So there would be a couple word choices. Never balance. Never even in moderation...that\'s another thing that I like to stay away from. But it would be more like ""oh, here\'s some ways to move more the next day."" \xa0Move differently. Reload your feet. \xa0And my favorite tip which is not in any book but I\'ll leave right here on this podcast.', ""KATY: It is. It's that you always keep a water bottle, a small water bottle, frozen in the freezer and when you wake up the next morning, you roll it under your feet so you're getting the icing, the cooling with also the pressure or the mobility. \xa0So it's a twofer."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Amazing.', ""KATY: So that's my High Heel Hangover - that's the Salty Dog of the next day."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0You heard it here first folks!', 'KATY: Exactly.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0That was an exclusive Between the Lines Podcast tip.', 'KATY: Exclusive! \xa0So to finish your question ', "" is for ... it's more technical. It has more mechanics in it. So in my mind, I just thought it'd be the next book for the person who already read the first one. Like I don't think it's too jargon heavy or technical. If you read the first one it's more exercises, more deeper explanation. It's also a great off shoot of "", ' if you\'re like, ""OK I love', ' but what can I do now? How do I dig in?"" It\'s like well then ', ' would be a great next one because now you can really get into gait and terrain and some corrective exercises for your feet that aren\'t the 70 exercises. Maybe one or two of them are there. But that you\'re really kind of expanding like ""I\'m gonna work on my feet right now. I\'m gonna work on my gait, on my stance."" \xa0And then also professionals. \xa0Professionals like Physios and for the people who I had to review that book....for my first book it was like podiatrists - people who see people in foot pain. That\'s totally different than who athletes tend to go through for their health information. So podiatrists really do see the bulk of the population most of which is non-exercising and sedentary. So that\'s really their most frequented person. Not the person willing to do a bunch of corrective exercise. So I wrote that book kind of for the podiatry crowd. ', ' is for people who, I think, are already pretty active on their feet. They are exercisers or athletes or people keen to mechanics who ... you know I had a lot of orthopedic surgeons who said, ""This is an awesome book.: \xa0I like the way it\'s explained because it makes sense to the orthos and also anatomists and also back to the cellular crowd. So it\'s just a good second. Like if you were a total lay person I would start with ', ' and then go to ', '. I guess everyone could kind of do that. \xa0Or you could jump right to ', "". So I wrote - it's more technical. I don't know if my grandmother would pick up "", '.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah because that's really asking a little bit more from readers, right? \xa0It's right there in the title. One book promises "", ' and the other indicates, ""you know what, this is actually bigger than just my feet."" \xa0', 'KATY: Yeah. And also transitioning to minimal footwear. \xa0Like there\'s an intention in that book: This is for people who maybe already want to, I mean there\'s a lot of people who made the transition to minimal footwear and ended up with big injuries. And there\'s a lot of ""barefoot is best"" \xa0mentality out there in the barefoot or running communities. But people were so, they were just injured. \xa0They were injured and I don\'t think that they knew why. And that took away a lot of the credibility for that barefoot is a state. The amount of injuries, I think, led the industry of the people who are in charge of publishing foot health information - which is podiatry - it kind of like discredited this idea that your feet are strong enough to move unshod. Because it wasn\'t a very deep argument. It didn\'t take into consideration adaptation, transition time, environment, the movement habits surrounding your single athletic barefoot bout. So I just wanted to broaden the discussion because I felt like I love the barefoot, minimal footwear, movement. I think it might be one of the single ... I almost said single handedly.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Single-footedly?', ""KATY: Exactly! \xa0It's going to make a lot of people move more of them with ease. Just by consuming differently. Like not even any other exercises. So it's important to me, I think, to make sure the discussion stays robust and everyone understands how they relate to it, how they can participate in it, and how they can transition more into it. So I wanted that book to be there. And it is and it's done really well. So I'm glad for that."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0You make the point that it could take somebody years...', 'KATY: \xa0Sure.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0...to transition to a minimal shoe. And that you shouldn't have the expectation that you're gonna read this book, put it down, go get a pair of earth runners and hit the road safely."", ""KATY: Right. \xa0But also that everyone can do something. Even the person who says I could never do that because my foot has x, y, and z problems. My point is your foot has x, y, and z problems likely because you've never used it."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. You could still spread your toes and get some benefit.', 'KATY: Yeah. \xa0And I unstack it. Right? So ', ' is being barefoot on the earth unstacked.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: It's taking ... so this is back to Movement... this is the "", '. All of my exercise books are unstacked versions of the natural thing.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: So it's like, being barefoot on the earth. Great. \xa0That is the thing that we're discussing that is beneficial. What are the nutrients that you experience in that? Ok, texture. \xa0Ok, all right. So you're in your house, you've never been unshod before. We're not gonna go running over your backyard. You're gonna start with a tennis ball. That is the least amount of pressure and there's no points on it or anything to cut you or harm you at all and you're just going to start rolling your foot over it. That later is a component on you stepping on a rock on a six-hour barefoot hike, you know, carrying a kid or a backpack. But it starts with a very low dose of vitamin texture. And all of the things. You know, tucking, doing the top of the foot stretch; which is reaching your foot behind you tucking your toes under. That's you sitting the ground with your feet tucked beneath you. A position that most people can't do. But it's the first step. It's a low dose. It's one nutrient pulled out of a food. So that's why nutritious movement words are there. Because these are the minerals and vitamins that end up making up the thing that you want to do. But you have to re-nourish yourself before you jump right into it. It's like re-releasing an animal into the wild. You have to train it back into behaviors that it doesn't know anything about."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: \xa0So that's what the transitioning is for. We're simulating many aspects of moving around unshod outside so that when you go do it you're more adapted to it without having even done it before."", 'KATY: Gosh. I can. You know I can.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I know you can. Will you?', ""KATY: \xa0You know I will. Yeah. \xa0It's like I'm interested in the idea of what adaptation actually means. There's a lot of words that get mixed up in our thoughts and we forget where the sources of the words come from. But just so everyone knows, adaptation in a biological sense is a change. Or sort of the process of change by which an organism, us, becomes better suited to its environment. \xa0Adaptation is a process and adaptation, I guess is the actual change itself. \xa0So I've been fascinated with the idea that if the state of your body right now requires a technology to work within the environment that it's in, is that technology now part of your anatomy?"", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Your arm brace or your knee brace or ...', ""KATY: Or your shoe. We can just keep it on shoes. It doesn't have to be injurious."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Ok. Ok.', ""KATY: So I think we want to go to the thing that's wrong with us because we don't think that footwear... that we've adapted to it, right? We don't think of it as what's wrong with us. But if you can't go outside without it, if you can't take a walk without it, if you're other biological functions can't perform without it - it's like an exoskeleton of sorts. \xa0That's how I've been thinking about my house and my shoes and my jackets. It's like oh these are parts of me that I could not survive without. I have an exoskeleton now. And the things that I'm putting on my body are all stand ins for something that my body used to be able to do. So I have a hard time not seeing footwear as my anatomy. And I understand what the actual definition of anatomy is. But because we create the language and the definitions they lend themselves very well to seeing that there is no problem."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mmm.', 'KATY: Right? So seeing that there is no problem because I\'m functioning just fine without looking around to say, ""And here\'s the list of things that I\'m just fine with. And here\'s the cost of those things."" That\'s the ', "" aspect of it. My sedentarism, let's just say off my feet for the sake of this podcast, requires a very large displacement of people and earth stuff. \xa0Now I, the reason it's not part of my anatomy though is because I could adapt to something else. Meaning I could lose those shoes, and I've gone through the process of losing them. Through my own efforts, I can harvest less. I mean, first of all, anyone can do this just by getting rid of the number of pairs of shoes that they have. Anyone can harvest less. \xa0Let's just get down to one pair of shoes."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Then with that one pair of shoes you can choose what the sources are for that. You can harvest less based on what type of shoe you choose to get. And you have to figure out what the displacement of earth's stuff are for that one pair of shoes that you get. Obviously, if you make your own shoes by hand you've outsourced even less. Right? \xa0So it's all "", "" at this point. So I've been able to have way less shoes, just out of preference. Like I can choose to have a preference for less number of shoes. And then I can choose to do more work with my arms and legs to make my own pair of shoes. But then it gets into, and then I can engage in this training program to start to improve the anatomy of my own feet. I have that potential to do so, to the extent where I need to wear my shoes less, which means they wear out in a shorter period of time. So you just keep working backwards to see, what do I need. And it's a very long transition. There's still activities that I want to engage in that require I wear footwear. "", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: But I could adapt to being fully barefoot if I made that my intention and I set up my life to be able to do that. Which means I would have to give up other things which really aren't enhancing my particular anatomy. I would have to do that. Which is - that's the thing."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: \xa0And then I could adapt to something - to not needing that technology as an exoskeleton. That's really the process that I'm in right now. Is slowly moving away from needing so much exoskeleton because it is a - because I require it right now to be fine. So my level to adaptation is to my environment which includes the stuff, so if I want less stuff and I have lots of motivations for why I want less stuff. It used to be solely for physical robusticity. \xa0But now I have been able to link my physical robusticity to other things that I'm interested in, which is the state of the planet... and other social justice issues. I've been able to kind of work backwards to that. Now I'm motivated to change my life. It's not just for strong feet. Which is where I started. \xa0And so that's what adaptation is. You could, through work, and not everyone has that equal capacity because of whatever physical health issues are, but to whatever your capacity is, you probably likely could slough off some exoskeleton through physical work specific for that. So that's what I'm talking about is to remove the technology. \xa0It's me stepping back from technology. Footwear is a technology. How can I consume less technology through more movement is the way that you link "", ', I would say to ', ' and ', '.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I just got whole body goosebumps in that answer.', 'KATY: ', ' baby.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0That's right.

And it also moves some of you, especially that front part of the foot that for many people is kind of over burdened. That's what I mean like you can't endlessly adapt. The fact that you carry all the weight on the front of your foot, you're not going to... like there's a... in "", ' I use the view-master as kind of an analogy of ... Your tissues are adaptable…', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: ...but there\'s a range of adaptability. So you\'ve got a tremendous amount in that range. But there is a range. So if you stand on the front of your foot all the time you\'re not going to beef up the front of your foot with like, ""Oh we\'ll we\'ll just grow bigger toe bones to be able to bear down."" You might increase the swelling of the area for a little while to increase pressure to kind of give you a buffer from the pressure. But eventually you kind of start creating a growth within the tissues or a way that the tissues are growing that is what we call certain diseases. Like the hallmark of certain diseases are simply tissue states. And often times they\'re just created by the way that we load them.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh-huh.', 'KATY: They are the tissue state that you would expect through that type of mechanical loading.

That\'s exactly what I would expect your body to do."" \xa0So let\'s take the pressure off.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: So shifting your weight towards your heels and off of the front of the foot is a simple alignment makeover, if you will, that you can do multiple times a day and you don't have to do it perfectly. You just have to do something. But you'll notice, if you're wearing heeled shoes, that you can't really shift back. \xa0The way that your body is able to balance that heel is by moving forward. And so take off your... get unshod is maybe the first thing that you can do. \xa0Just get something comfortable and safe and then try to back up.

And I always am unable to recall one or two of them. But yeah, I believe I am told it is 8.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm. You know the first book just occurred to me one day. You know, ""what I should do is write a book."" And I love books. I am someone who has gathered most of my knowledge from books versus experiences. I would be holed up in my, not even in my house, in my nook in my room in my house with a book and through books, I was able to glean a certain understanding of the world. So it\'s probably a natural medium. I\'ve transitioned away from that, definitely over the last few years, gathering my information through books. But I have such a natural relationship with books that it was probably the best place for me to flesh out my own thoughts. You know it\'s one thing to casually talk over 8 hours to a group of people. You know, it\'s another thing to be limited in word count. It makes you drill down your own understanding of your own field. And so it\'s almost like my works are my workbooks.', 'KATY: You know people can read them and extract from them. But what you\'re looking at the result of me forcing myself to explain to myself or to someone...or to my editor, anywhere, where she\'s like, ""This is not clear."" No one would really say that during a verbal piece because it becomes clear through eight hours of rambling and if I can\'t articulate something in words then I was like, ""Just watch me do this with my arm."" Or it\'s easier to teach something through demonstration, through you and me being in the same room and me putting on my hands to push you into a particular position. It\'s much more challenging to write it in 80 words. And so I find that I probably wrote books just for myself to be able to hone my own message more clearly. So that\'s why books.', ""KATY: I'm so sneaky."", 'KATY: There\'s no limit to the number of books you can write. You know my body of work is large because the ideas are very large. The ideas, you know, when you\'re talking about one recipe it can be kind of small. When you\'re trying to explain human things, biological things and you\'re saying that ""hey the body has 300 moving parts or axes"" and then your other book is like, ""no wait there\'s a trillion moving axes in the body"", your word count goes rapidly up. So yes there are a lot of books but also, I not only need the number of books to cover the vastness of the idea, the portal into this idea, you know the idea of why movement is so important is maybe only interesting to chronically curious movement teachers. People already moving. For that population, I could have probably written just one really thick book. How do you describe the importance of movement to someone who has almost no relationship with movement and maybe hasn\'t because they\'ve been in chronic pain their entire life? Where the constant ""you should move more, move more, why don\'t you move more, why aren\'t you exercising already"" propaganda that\'s coming at you really every time you go to your doctor\'s office, every time you go to the store and look at the magazine racks. I mean we have enough of ""you need to move"" exercise messaging. The accessibility is really small. So I wrote a book about foot pain. And here are some things that your feet should do. And that book was not to appeal to those who are interested in going across the monkey bars and walking 40 miles and living a movement rich life. It was someone who was like, ""I\'m not getting the full experience that I\'d like to have. Like I can\'t walk through my house without cringing in pain and I\'m taking these medications"" and so it made the ""move more"" message accessible to someone who didn\'t think of himself as having symptoms of a movement deficit, who just had this tiny issue. And so I\'ve written a lot of books to increase the accessibility of my message. I\'m trying to make it as inclusive as possible. So you\'ll see, as you read my body of work, as we\'ll talk about it too. This is one of the things I\'m excited about this. As we\'re talking about different books, each book has slightly different shaped portal. There\'s different keys, we are not all the same. We are not motivated by the same thing. Yet there are some common threads we share being, you know, all belonging to this human beings population. And so the books are different keyholes so that you, as a person, can find the book that matches your key. So that\'s why... so I mean I guess I\'m gonna have to write a trillion books. Or, I\'m just trying to find...', ""KATY: Exactly. Starting now. So I'm just trying to find these really general keyholes where maybe if you guys know how keys work which is another fascinating topic on its own, to find kind of a..."", ""KATY: No. No, I'm going to write a book about it too. ...A skeleton keyhole where large groups of people can all fit into one book. But that book changes you as you pass through it and then the other books now align more with you. So that's how they work together."", ""KATY: Well they're all for everyone but the order at which you go through is going to depend on your key."", ""KATY: Oh yeah. And it's an unanswerable question."", 'KATY: And it\'s the book that matches or aligns most currently with who you are right now. I would not expect every book to resonate with every person because I\'m not writing all these books just for you the one person. I\'m writing them, again, they\'re my notebook. You are seeing an evolution of a... it\'s not really an evolution of ideas, you\'re seeing, you\'re entering an idea and then you are watching the concepts expand beneath you. If you\'ve ever moved through a science or ever moved through a mathematics training program, you start with these tiny nuts and bolts that are easy to grasp and then they start configuring and then you\'re like, ""ok this is more complicated now"" and so these tiny nuts and bolts - grasping them are often necessary to assemble the next set of ideas and the next set of ideas. So nothing is really, it\'s a journey. It\'s a journey through the books. So I\'ve written them for everyone but I am also always thinking, you know, you have to line up with, I mean we\'re a consumer based society and movement is not a science that we\'re fluent in. It\'s not a knowledge set that we\'re fluid in and we\'re also, we\'re a sedentary consumer based society or culture, so we are used to, if we go to the bookstore, ""I don\'t want to be barefoot. I\'m not gonna read ', '"". Like I have, ""my abs, where\'s my book for my abs"" or whatever. So, I\'m trying to put them in the language that we\'re already comfortable working with around movement. I\'m trying to change the language around exercise but the fact of the matter is, everyone knows exercise more than they know (ding) ... did I get it right? Did I get the answer right? Is that what that ding was?', ""KATY: Ding. Right. I don't need to belabor the example. Like that's - I've written them and probably will continue to write at least a few more, to make the ideas more accessible."", 'KATY: Yeah, sure.', 'KATY: Well, exactly. Like the purpose of my books are for everyone. For everyone to be able to see how they are themselves moving. I can see how you move. We\'re so used to going to the person who is in charge of the movement understanding and telling me what I\'m doing wrong and what I need to do now and push this here. And they do all the work of knowing for you. We have outsourced not only movement, we have outsourced knowing and that model where a therapist has what you need and because your knowing doesn\'t increase that you get better by engaging with them more frequently. That model is not really a sustainable one. Because it depends on someone paying that therapist for a long period of time. Most people don\'t have copious amount of incomes to get the frequency, when we\'re talking about movement, to get the frequency down. And so a lot of movement teachers are really great and they\'re giving exercise homework, right. So it\'s like we\'re doing this right now, some of it, like some exercise models, are ""you come here to do the exercise with me. Ok, see you tomorrow."" Right? Like they\'re providing a space for you to come in and engage. But you needing to come in and engage over and over again is the model by which you are going to move. Then there are movement teachers who are like, ""Ok, this class is not only to lead you through this bout of movement but to show you some things so that you can see how you\'re moving. So that you can be moving as you are in this class, more frequently."" And that\'s the model that we have, graduates that have gone through our program, and that\'s to me a very important distinction between just going to class to get moved during that period and someone who is not only helping you move for that period of time but giving you different ways and lessons so that you can increase the frequency when you\'re not engaged in that movement space. That space in your life that you\'ve carved outside. And then there\'s this next level which is what I\'m trying to offer through my books which is not only having a class based or a time for exercise, someone showing you how you\'re moving, someone teaching you how to see how you\'re moving.', 'KATY: So that you can move differently but then also what are the lifestyle components, the way of thinking about how your whole entire life is shaped so that your environment is facilitating movement. So my books are not exercise books per se in that ""run through these 30 exercises"" you know, ""3 times a week."" It\'s more like, ""we need to think about our entire life. You need to know where you wear your hips all the time and here\'s where you can wear them more effectively for x and y and z."" So that\'s my point of writing them is so that you no longer need, you no longer are outsourcing knowing. You\'ve done the work to know. So when you call and ask me about my x, y, z, I will say, ""well I would point you here so that you can access yourself."" I\'m on a radio. I can\'t see you. I don\'t, like it\'s going to a diet. ""What should I eat?"" It depends. Who are you? What are your blood panels? What are your symptoms? What is your life like right now? Like there\'s so much that goes into that that I\'m less about ""here\'s my five moves for x, y, and z"", ""Here\'s where you can start knowing about your own body, how it works and how to move it differently if you want a different outcome.""', 'KATY: That is definitely one component. Right? But I think that the person isn\'t interested in the paradigm being shifted so if someone asks me ""What is your purpose?"" Or, ""What is your mission statement for your work?"" That is a great question. Because I am trying to shift the academic understanding of exercise and movement but that\'s directed towards academics. That\'s the way that that trickles down. So I\'m working on that level. I\'m working with movement teachers overall to kind of get them to not only shift their personal behavior, which would be then at this next level that I\'m talking about. But then going, ""Hey is your movement practice one that perpetuates the exercise model or are you aware of the movement model over here."" You know so you\'re shifting the professional level. And I\'m definitely doing lots of outreach towards that. And then there\'s just right direct to the individual who is supposed to be the recipient of both academic knowledge and professional knowledge. Right? That end user of both of those things who maybe could be doing a lot more themselves if they had more knowledge. So I\'m really working on three different levels and have objectives for each different level. All of which I would consider my work. And I put it all out via one channel. If you\'re an academic, you\'re gonna pick up on certain aspects of it. If you are someone with low back pain that kept you from moving and you realize there was a glute muscle that should have been there that wasn\'t there, you\'re gonna be interacting with that same material but in a different way. So everyone has a different set of intention and understanding or knowledge that\'s based on all other components of their life. And they will each extract something unique from this one body of work that I put out. So the body of work is individualized to the recipient because you can only extract from it what you can. You know. You only get the information that your keys are lining up with. I don\'t see the distinction really between those three levels. But I understand that those three levels are going on because some person with a low back thing will have a particular understanding of the world where my academic arguments are the thing that helps them get more pelvic listing in their life.', ""KATY: The academic under level will make more sense to them than the exercise level because maybe they weren't an exerciser. Where someone who has only done fitness and they love fitness, they'll be able to extract the fitness culture elements but the other cultural aspects will fly by and that's fine. That's why you can go through my body of work multiple times. You don't need to go farther, you need to go deeper into this broad amount that there is because you will change as you pass through each one and thus when you pass through the rest again you will extract new things. So there's a lot going on."", 'KATY: Mm-hmm. Yeah.', ""KATY: I think that they could speak for themselves. I feel like a lot of accessibility, meaning that you perceive that these books are for you, that's thwarting often what you can extract from the books. And not everyone's a book reader. Right? There's a lot of people who listen to this podcast, I mean we're close to 2 million downloads."", 'KATY: Which is a lot. But I would say, I mean I\'ve met with a lot of people who have come in for various things who are like, ""I\'ve listened to the podcast. I\'ve never read a book though."" You know and you\'re going wow. Which is totally fine. So I think some people are, they like, they like Instagram. They like Instagram learning. Right? They like that short burst or whatever, scan for two minutes, take one big takeaway to change their lives and then some people love audio. They just like this idea that they can take a walk or maybe go to bed and hear us chat about these things and that\'s a really easy way for them to grasp and learn and apply. So I think the book club was to serve two purposes. One, to help people who have read the books maybe make some links between the books that need to be facilitated by me. Because everything\'s very clear to me being very, I mean it\'s all passed through my mind. So I, there are a lot of connections between all the books that I see that are maybe more implicit than explicit. They are noted in a sentence or a short paragraph. And if you read a book and skim it over ... you know like, have you ever gone to a movie with someone else and you\'re like ""Wow that was amazing! Did you see how they took the book of Job and like expanded into these characters?"" And the other person is like ""Wow, I just liked the action of that movie."" Like we\'re not all grasping the same things from everything. So, I thought that I could use this podcast within a podcast as a time to do some of that work for you. Because I\'m more fluent in those languages. Because I wrote them. So, like, connect the different books to people which would help. Or for the listener if they didn\'t want to read any of the books, be able to go a little bit deeper in the material just by, just by hearing different connections. Whether or not you\'ve actually read the words I think is helpful to cement the various theories that are presented and then for someone listening who does, who is asking, ""Which exercise do I need? Which book do I read?"" Very challenging to answer thousands of emails about that. But you can do the work through listening to go ""Ah, I get it. That\'s my key. That sentence resonated with me. That\'s where I start."" So to help people, to help direct them better to this very large body of knowledge that\'s there for the taking that you can get at your library, right? So it\'s not, I don\'t need people to go out and buy a bunch of books but for people who are asking a ton of questions, it would be more helpful for them if they read the books or they figured out where to put their time and attention. So that\'s what this purpose is now.', 'KATY: Oh my gosh. Are you serious?', ""KATY: Wait. No is it just a single word or what do I say? I've never done a word association."", 'KATY: Oh my ...', 'KATY: Ok.', ""KATY: It's not a word?"", 'KATY: I\'m not creative at all. I\'m very much like, ""What\'s the rule? Do I get one word or can I say sentence fragment or a sentence? What do I get?""', ""KATY: Ok. All right. So there's no rule?"", 'KATY: It makes me feel a little better. Yeah.', 'KATY: Oh my word.', 'KATY: Yes.', 'KATY: Technical.', 'KATY: Inspiring.', 'KATY: Helpful.', 'KATY: Get up!', ""KATY: That's just what came to mind!"", 'KATY: Ooh. Complete.', 'KATY: Uh, layperson.', 'KATY: ', '.', 'KATY: Lost child.', ""KATY: Not only am I gonna ask the question, I'm going to..."", 'KATY: Important.', ""KATY: Yay! Ding. Where's my ding now?"", ""KATY: I am, I'm teaching the program that we offer, which is closed now. So we have students who train with us for a couple of years to be able to learn how to teach the correctives and they really know the correctives in depth to help people move their bodies and help people see how they move their bodies so they can move their bodies differently. It's a week. Their training concludes with a week-long training so I'm going to Europe to finish out that week for one group of students and then also for the public, I'm so excited about this. I know Dani and I have talked about it before, but we are doing a, there is a beach, I think it's like a pancake and coffee house. An organic pancake and coffee house on the beach..."", ""KATY: ...that's having a book signing. Because "", '.', ""KATY: Thank you. And we'll be doing a press/book signing/minimal footwear swap out there. So that will be happening just when this...when does this come out?"", ""KATY: Oh. So that already passed. So sorry that you missed it, everybody. But it was, I'm sure, fantastic."", 'KATY: It was really great. Yes.', ""KATY: I will be at the Ancestral Health Symposium in Seattle in September. But basically I'm taking, you know what, there might be a couple exciting events coming up in September. We'll have to wait a little bit more as I'll see how those flesh out. Other public events. I'm really trying to do more back to that one on one teaching where I work with a small group which is kind of my roots. You know it all kind of exploded where I'm talking to a gajillion people at once through the airwaves. And that's super wonderful. And I'm grateful for that ability. But there is something to be said for being available to a group of people live and putting my eyes on them and having them put their eyes on my elbows as I'm moving a particular thing. And my shoulders and my knees. So a lot more of that coming up. And then I'll be in uh... New Zealand, I'm coming for you! So I'll see you in New Zealand pretty soon."", 'KATY: Yeah. Starting in July.', 'KATY: Yeah my social media break is not a work break. Just to be clear. It\'s not gonna be, ""Oh I\'d like to take some time off and just step away from that."" It\'s actually me trying to stack my life in a way that allows me to accomplish what I want to accomplish for work in a way that aligns better with really me using my own messaging. You know, for me applying the principles that I am trying to educate others on. So I\'m gonna be using my newsletter software as a way to connect in various ways. So if you imagine, like one newsletter, like I don\'t really subscribe to newsletters because that\'s not the way that, that\'s not my keyhole for my particular key. I\'m going to use my newsletter software though to send out keys of different shapes so that if social media was a key for you, maybe not just because it was social media but because you like the quickness of it, the easy scan of it, I\'m going to be playing around with sending out these different keyholes of outreach so that I can continue to move my message forward in a more stacked way. So if you go to ', "" you can sign up to get that. Of course, you can unsubscribe at any time. And then see if that works for you. Because it's, hopefully, what I'm hoping is it's a way to get, to extract the most nutritious part of my message without some of the physical aspects, the thumbs and the shoulders and the upper spine and the neck and the eyes and in the high frequency of using all of those in the social media way, so that it's, we can get rid of the things that aren't serving us. So anyway. If you're interested, that's where you can go."", ""KATY: That's a question that we get a lot, right?"", 'KATY: We, like you, me and this mouse in my pocket.', 'KATY: Well you didn\'t ask about that book. That\'s going to be a different book. People will ask, like they ask about a lot of things, like, ""What\'s the best way to x,y,z?"" That the, there\'s not really a best way to take in your reading as much as it is like, vary up. Vary up the positions in which you\'re reading. So read a little bit on your stomach. Read a little bit on your back. Or, ', ' and all of our authors submitted various ways that they kind of move while reading. But if you only change one thing, a very simple way would be to move the book a farther distance from your face than you normally hold it. Unless you\'re trying to read without your glasses, where the distance is really set for the focus of your eyes, the focus ability of your eyes, reach your arms longer, right? That\'s not only going to create a different experience for your wrist, your elbow, and your shoulders. And then the muscles of your upper back as you deal with this length. It\'s going to change the muscle length in your eye. So even if you\'re like, ""I don\'t know what else to do with my knees and my hips. I\'m just gonna sit here in my chair and read."" Fine. But move your arms a little bit farther away from you to play with relaxing your eyes a little bit and If I took a picture of you reading you would hold the same joint angle over and over and over again. So just play with that. And you\'ll come back to your preferred position so just move it back out again and hang out there. So that\'s a quick makeover tip.', ""KATY: It's weird. Well and do that with your phone too. You know what, if you're not ready for your social media break, you're gonna hold it at this fixed distance so stretch that puppy out. Get it out there, for sure."", 'KATY: Show notes.', ""KATY: Yeah. I'm excited about going forward. I think we're going to go deep. Which is good."", 'KATY: Ooh. Bookends. Bookends.', ""KATY: They are They definitely are. They're bookends."", 'KATY: Is there gonna be a lightening round every single time because I feel like I might need to prepare.', 'KATY: Oh. All right. My bad.', 'KATY: All right. Perfect.', 'KATY: All right. Thanks, everyone.']"

But when you have an 80-year-old, almost, who is, like, 70 wasn’t too late for me. Move better at 80 than I did at 69. That’s impactful.', 'KATY: So, we’re gonna talk about nature today. We’re gonna talk about nature-school today but, but in doing a lot of research for this book it turns out that, you know, vitamin N and this nature movement has got a lot of traction in schools. We’re thinking about “oh, what’s good for kids?” Right. But of course, it’s what’s good for humans of all ages and blue spaces was a term that I found in a couple of research papers where they’re finding that, that, um, goldeners, I’m going to coin this term, dangit.

And I feel like if you’re listening and you’re not one of those people who wrote in you’re like, “I gotta start a nature school? I already got a job.” So the overarching theme is not “start a nature school” as much as, “different ways to bring nature into your personal life, your community”. Communidy. I just listening to the outtakes of the audio book. There was a lot of communidy. So community. We edited them all out. So how to bring it into your community. Whether it’s your education community. If you have families or friends, how to get together collectively in nature. So right off the bat, before we', 'KATY: By no means.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: So before, we’re going to go into schooling and then, of course, ways to expand that. But the first thing, I just read … the BBC, I was gonna go look for it right? ', '. And one of the things it was talking about was, I’m stalling because I’m trying to look for it as I talk, one of the things it mentioned was step 1, create a green space in your home. Like, don’t worry if you are like in a total urban area and you’re just like “we can’t get to nature”. Bring nature into your home. And there’s a whole appendix in ', ', that the creator of my nature school and the larger nature organization, she put it together because she’s taken lots of training. And the first thing is, get plants in your home. Get rocks. Get, I mean we have … I should post a couple of pictures. I just have, our window sills are full of treasures. And the treasures that we find when we’re hiking aren’t only to commemorate the hike as much as they’re things to touch again and recall.', 'KATY: Yeah. Well, you kind of do as a human, right?', 'KATY: So that’s the thing. We keep talking about it as it’s decor. But let’s go back a step. Humans require plant input. The end. So, one way you can improve your, or to, like, nature up your life, is to allow a little bit more nature inside the walls of your home than are currently serving as a barrier between you and the rest of the natural world. So, bring some inside. You don’t have to put a sandbox in your living room, but there are little ways.', 'KATY: All right. Now. School.', 'Send me that and I’ll put it in the show notes', 'KATY: Just come over. Everyone just come over.', 'KATY: Well this is not going to air right now but, yes, as soon as you hear this, just text me and I’ll give you Dani’s address.', 'KATY: So, let’s talk about nature school. All of our kids are in nature school. Different ages. I have younger kids. My kids are 4 and 5 and how old are yours?', 'KATY: Yeah, that’s like a nice spectrum I think. There’s definitely earlier. And I have been in nature school with my kids since they were infants, so I’ve got that phase covered. When did you guys start?', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Okay. All right, so, what is your school like?', 'KATY: So what is that technically, like, starting at 6?', 'KATY: Ok.', 'KATY: What do you mean by “skills”? Just so I know we’re on the same … like what versus the other school?', 'KATY: Got it.', 'KATY: What was… and in the school before, what were they doing in that school then? I just trying… I want to get a sense of, I would love everyone to like, what are the different things that are going on…', 'KATY: Like long walks…', 'KATY: Oh got it.', 'KATY: Because there’s a difference. You don’t want to be hot on the tail of a raccoon only to turn out rawr!', 'KATY: I know.', 'KATY: Well, there’s a lot of different components. So there’s one large organization, which is Olympic Nature Experience. And that program has multiple programs for different ages that we’ve attended. So the first one is a, it’s a drop in parent/child experience. And it was, it’s from infants, really up until ages 5 or 6. And it’s one day a week, it’s like 5 bucks and it is, it meets year around, all weather, and it would be, I feel like its purpose is to facilitate nature experiences for people who don’t, who aren’t comfortable on their own, where that’s something maybe new. Like the fact that you go out, even when it’s raining and that you can take your kids out in it. So I feel like it’s a service in that it kind of bridges the gap for people who have long-term nature deficit. Where I would put myself in that category, like, comfortable in nature was not how I grew up.', 'KATY: I grew up being conditioned to be afraid of nature. Just in case anyone is thinking that I was something different. No. I was not.', 'KATY: No. Absolutely not.', 'KATY: So that has stories, there’s storytelling. Our school of all different ages and skills uses storytelling as a tool because it is a traditional way of usually explaining lessons without it being, “ok everybody, now you’re gonna learn this.” And so', 'KATY: So there’s a lot of stories that are used to help you identify animals. That’s how our school uses them. For example, there’s all these stories about, you know, how the chipmunk got its stripes. But then you learn, based on the number of stripes, and it was like, you know, and then this animal scratched its back as it went through and that’s why it has stripes. And they understand that that’s not why they have stripes and yet, at the same time, they’ll remember how many stripes it has and how to identify it.', 'KATY: So lots of things like that for very small children. As well as being down by the water, you know, poking things with sticks. That very natural, organic, desire to explore without any lesson agenda on it. You know, you’re dealing with other kids', 'KATY: You’re dealing with other grown ups. So it’s almost kind of like, there’s a lot of elements. It is facilitated but it’s not overly structured.', 'KATY: Sure. And it’s also', 'KATY: For those of you who have a nature school or have envisioned starting something larger, this program has been around for a very long time. It’s done in conjunction with our Audubon center. It is the natural feeder into the nature school. Because what you have are kids who have been around the teachers for years and years and years. Their parents are comfortable with them, with the teachers. The children are comfortable with the teachers. The parents have over these years, developed a comfort themselves in nature. And so it kind of makes sense, like, “oh, I guess we’ll go to nature school because my child feels comfortable here.” It’s not, where if you are comfortable in the home, going to school inside is maybe a more natural segway, right? You’re just so used to being inside why wouldn’t you go to school inside? Well if you’re regularly engaging outside, why wouldn’t you go to school outside.', 'KATY: It’s a really great program. Super easy and I highly recommend for anyone starting a nature program to begin with something like this. Because you don’t have to deal with all the things that come with being responsible for children on your own.', 'KATY: All the parents are there, right? So you’re just going, “I love nature. You love nature. I like stories. I have some basic training. I have a space.” Let’s start here. And it’s like, it’s a very easy way to get started. So that’s our infant/toddler. My kids still go sometimes.', 'KATY: No. It’s one day a week. It’s a weekday thing.', 'KATY: We take kids all the time that aren’t ours to that.', 'KATY: No no', 'KATY: You gotta think outside the way you’re normally used to doing things.', 'KATY: Then there is the school which is the pre-school. It’s a 3-6. So it’s a little bit past preschool. That is the nature school. And then there is a program, 5 to 10, which is skills. So that’s why I was interested in how your school delineates with skills.', 'KATY: So skills, I think by our school’s definition, are those things where more responsibility for one’s own actions are translating more into a direct manifestation of what they did. Like a fire or, you know, or they’re using knives now. When I was in California and on the Markegard farm for our launch party, we spent a day at their nature school. And they’re nature school is entirely different than our nature school because it goes, it started with older kids, like 14-18-year-olds and has filled down all the way to pre-school over the last', 'KATY: And it’s like 40 and 50 and 60 kids. Like, it’s huge. It’s like, wow, this is a long-established program. And the kids break off into different groups and at different levels. They’re in all different areas. But they had badged. Their skills had… they all this leather badge and they would get different stamps punched into it when they got their tree climbing skills, like, for example, to learn, to get the tree climbing skills badge you had to, you have to be able to identify the type of tree that you’re about to climb. You can’t climb if you don’t know what it is. Or, you can but you can’t…these are the requirements of your badge.', 'KATY: Yeah. And like you have a journal and you have to spend time drawing and writing things about the tree. Sketching the bark, what are the animal species that are coming to it? What does it look like in the winter? What does it look like in the summer? And so, you have a tree journal. Just, so, again, if you’re like “no way school”, tree journals might be something, like I would actually like to have a tree journal as part of just something that I do. You know, like, “oh…”', 'KATY: Why? Is that what you got me? Is that what you got me for Christmas? Why?', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: We’re twinsies.', 'KATY: Well, just send me your tree journal when you’re done. But it’s like the beauty of sketching, right? There’s so many things that you’re observing. It’s more than just like matching. You’re like really paying attention to it. Smelling. What does it smell like? You know, like, what do your senses tell you about this being that is in front of you. So anyway there’s that and then there’s, there’s five rule. I don’t have my tree badge. I don’t know exactly. It’s like, “Don’t step on any branches that are dead. Don’t step on any branches that are smaller than your wrist.” They just have these things that you learn that eventually go out and give you kind of a template for when you’re outside of the school, etc.', 'KATY: So that’s our skills. And then we’ve got this pre-school that’s in the middle, which both of my kids have attended all of the years it’s been in existence. My son does two days in the preschool and then one day in the skills. The skills will increase in frequency of days because the programs keep filling which is great. But we have that, that preschool is definitely more..their tracking, I find it to be nature rich. Like, I find my kids are always coming home with these things about animals. I just did an interview for Soft Star on nature. We can link to that in the show notes. But it’s like, you know, my son will just pop off… does anyone else have this phenomenon when your kids come home from school and they’re like, “Uh, nothing” or “How was your day?” and then like five hours later, or 7 days later they’ll just pop off… it’s like, “The ears of an owl are in the same line.” And you’re like, “What?” It’s like, “One’s higher than the other.” And I’m like, “What are you talking about?”', 'KATY: Yeah. It’s amazing and it’s always…', 'KATY: They do. And', 'KATY: Huge.', 'KATY: Super fun game but I’m gonna tell everyone now. And Dani, I swear you would like to play it with me. One person sits blindfolded or eyes closed if they’re trustworthy in a circle with keys right in front of them. So they’re sitting cross-legged on the ground keys in front of them. Everyone else is in a circle around that person and then one leader, it’s the teacher, right? So all the kids, there’s one kid in the middle, all the kids in the circle. I say kids… I love playing this game. The teacher will point to a kid and that kid will have to creep in and try to steal the keys. But the person in the middle is listening intently. And it’s', 'KATY: pointing the finger at any person that they hear coming in. It’s so fun. It’s so fun. And what is it? It’s like it’s a game for both the person in the middle the people on the outside.', 'KATY: Like it’s, oh, so many games like that that have some sort of', 'KATY: physical skill but thoughtful too. I mean, your awareness is heightened, but lots of things like that.', 'KATY: We do. And they’re starting senior classes, called Silver Foxes.', 'KATY: Or even like Audubon Center.', 'KATY: There are nature organizations that lead bird walks. And there’s an expert there who’s like, “Oh do you hear that call?” I mean there’s a lot of different ways to get it. Bushcraft classes.', 'KATY: Well, I think that the first thing to do, so because the thing with resources is sometimes they don’t cover everywhere. The first thing to do is just go Google your town name and, or your city area and nature program. Like what are the key words? Because what I have found is a lot of stuff isn’t online in the way that you would expect it to be.', 'KATY: Ok…', 'KATY: Ah.', 'KATY: Oh, so these aren’t resources. These are steps.', 'KATY: Ok. So step one… wait are you talking personal mission statement regarding nature school? Is that what I hear coming out of your mouth?', 'KATY: PMS. What were you looking for.', 'KATY: So you were looking for, your kids are older, they want actionable items, use', 'KATY: Yeah. And does it have to be weekend, outside? There are a lot of things to identify.', 'KATY: And then all, like, I think of timing as a big thing. Because we’re used to fitting nature in and around our non-nature time. So I think at first glance, it’s gonna be, what are the after school programs, you know, besides schooling, is it supplemental, like to homeschooling? Does your nature school, do you want it to include educational curriculum? Because that’s one thing that I didn’t – there’s traditional education. Some nature schools are actually doing more traditional, oh what’s the term, like core?', 'KATY: Yeah, so they’re doing academics out in nature and then some nature schools don’t really, they have a different way of getting to those same concepts that are not as conventional. And then there are some nature schools that are just focusing on the nature skills themselves.', 'KATY: So, try to figure out … would you be happy with any of them? Because you are doing a balancing act of what you most want. Definitely, put that on paper. And then what’s available and then how can you, how can YOU help create the thing that you actually want, right? That’s gonna be the next piece All right, so mission statement…', 'KATY: And', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: That’s the big thing because sometimes a lot of times, bushcraft, people who are experts in nature are not also online experts. Like that’s, that is the reality. If they are out in nature, they don’t have that, right? They’re small – these are small programs. They’re not mass produced because that’s kind of the antithesis to what they’re all about. So I have found so many things when I’m traveling through town that I can’t find online, I find in flyers in parks.', 'KATY: Go to the … I mean like, they’re all about the flyer. “I have time to make this flyer. On my hike out I’ll stake it to this board.”', 'KATY: So read the flyers because that is where I first found, six years ago, there’s like a whole organization here that’s not the school that I’m talking about, of rewilding yourself. Like way before it’s .. not on the internet…', 'KATY: is this man who has just been teaching these skills out on his land and it’s got a huge community. On a flyer outside the natural grocery store. Right? So, just think outside of the internet box when it comes to looking for nature. Also', 'KATY: people who write, you know your nature, local nature bookstores. So if there’s like a local nature museum, I keep saying Audubon because that’s what’s close, they’ll often carry books by, like a lot of experts write books. They’ll self-publish these small gorgeous guides. Find them. Because they know everyone in the community. So go look, flip over those books. Find their name. Ask someone if they have their phone number if they don’t have a website and track that person down because that person is your portal to the wisdom of the landscape of your area.', 'KATY: So find them.', 'KATY: Um-hmm.', 'KATY: Well, I mean creating an entire school… it is, I have witnessed it first hand of someone starting from nothing to a huge flourishing school busting her butt to do so. It comes because other parents are super passionate about it and don’t have her skill set but who have other skill sets.', 'KATY:But definitely. A co-op is nice. Just to share a little bit. The first thing she did when she wanted to have this was she had a meeting just asking people “who wants to be on the board”. Right? Even if you don’t do a formal board, just make an impromptu board. Like is there someone with computer skills? Is there someone who is good at facebook that could handle creating a Facebook page for our organization and informing our community. And it starts with this little nature play day. Or I’m gonna teach a two-hour family wild food class, right? Now you get a bunch of people interested and you can share your information that way. So, they’re definitely, it’s interesting because that organic grass roots movement – groose roots – that organic grass roots feeling is almost necessary for this organic grass roots skill set. Right.', 'KATY: It’s part of it. It’s part of it.', 'KATY: I remember, I’m just thinking outside of that, that traditional…when we were in, I think it was Amsterdam, we were in a park, huge city park. I mean huge city, right? And we were just lounging in this park and running around – big park. But there was a preschool, it wasn’t a preschool…there was a school that had all these kids and this tshirt.. it was a nature school but it was a nature after school program.', 'KATY: It was perfect because if you’re trying to negotiate school, like traditional academics versus nature school and that’s kind of an insurmountable issue, sometimes having a 3-5:30 program is way easier.', 'KATY: And then you’ve got, my kids go to nature school. They go to nature school after regular school and it serves all of these same purposes. So I just, I feel like there’s so many ways this can be done. If you’re like, “I can’t do a full school but hey I only work ‘til this time or I know someone who is really good with kids and nature after school, maybe we’ll just start this co-oppy – We do, everyone after nature school actually comes to our house. I mean that’s not a formal thing but it’s just like, we’re gonna be out moving still and why not keep the kids moving because they, frankly, they’re transitioned to outside. They don’t want to come in, so, “One more hike for everyone.”', 'KATY: Just tons of food. I mean we just keep the party going. So, so many different ways and if you don’t want to do a formal school, just get a hiking group together.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm. Yeah.', 'KATY: A hiking group is a really great way to transition. It doesn’t have to be a school. We don’t have to call it a school.', 'KATY: It’s just a gathering, right? So, hiking groups. Holiday hiking groups. Weekend hiking groups. After school hiking groups. Dinner hiking groups. Think out of the box. So many different ways of like, all right, pack your lunches we are doing, because we all work, we’re trapped inside. There are so many days when I have to be … I don’t have to be… where I AM in front of my computer relentlessly. And I feel sick by 4:00. I’m like that was the day. And then I go, you know what? It’s not the day. THere’s many more hours of this day and it’s like text everyone, dinner, meet me here, bring your kids, bring your jackets and hats, there’s this apple tree that I know that’s that seven apples still left on it. And we will spend the last three hours, half of it in the pitch black with headlamps, being outside as a huge group. And those are, to date, some of my fondest memories of my family community time. It’s the day when I just kind of scrambled for those last dark hours. It doesn’t have to be beautiful day and easy. IT was a little more challenging but so what. Like it was group. So dinner hiking groups once a week. See if that fits in your mission statement.', 'KATY: Autodidactic?', 'KATY: HA! Wait a minute! What just happened? Were you reaching for a word and I supplied it?', 'KATY: I said it! Yeah.', 'KATY: You’re welcome.', 'KATY: I feel like we may have jumped the shark. This might be the moment.', 'KATY: All right. So tell me more about the auto-didactic group that you were mentioning?', 'Wilderness Awareness school', 'Kamana Naturalist Training program', 'Gone Feral', 'NOLS', 'Wilderness Awareness School', 'KATY: No.', 'KATY: That was good. I mean it’s just, in the end it’s just to get started you just have to decide to start. You know, like I … we can keep giving links but they’re all there on the internet for you to find them or in your particular area. It’s just going to be asking around. And again, technology, using technology a little bit to help your transition back to nature, just go right now to your social media and be like, “Who, who is a forager? Herbalist?” Like there’s so many different ways you can go about it and often times I’ve found people in areas where I’m traveling or here in town and it’s very difficult. Like if you are really good at a skill, like writing or being an herbalist, or being a biomechanist, or like whatever that thing is, you want, like, you don’t have expertise in a ton of other things and so it’s challenging sometimes for someone who has that wisdom or skill set to also be a good business person. So it’s hard to start classes because you have to be not only a master herbalist but also, you know, an entrepreneur. And so, it happens that these classes just become very difficult for these people and they just don’t teach. Even though they love to teach and want to teach.', 'KATY: So I have often said, “oh I will gather the people for you. You don’t have to do the work of a class. Would you be willing to teach the class? I will put it together. I will just pay you for your time and then I can do all the work in the background.” So if you’re like I can’t find the class that’s perfect for me. Then make the class that’s perfect for you – put it together. You do the work to put it together and then the teacher and you benefit.', 'KATY: So I have just had to do that quite often because it’s like, well I want a class on this … and I want it to be all ages, right, because I… you know, so you just, you just figure out what it is that you want and then you… I am so my mother right now … make it happen. You just make it happen.', 'KATY: And space.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: And a love so much for the nature that they want you to do it.', 'KATY: Right? That’s part of their job. They are stewards. And there is no better way to get people interested in protecting and valuing nature than being comfortable and relishing in it.', 'KATY: So that’s why, you know, so many of these people are in…they want what you want too. So everyone wants it. You just have to figure out the details.', 'KATY: Well, I feel like, I feel like this was helpful.', 'KATY: What else? You got another one?', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: Didn’t you offer to intern one time and they told you that they had an internship but it was a paid internship?', 'Kamana Naturalist training program', 'KATY: I love that.', 'KATY: And go to the library. And get a book.', 'KATY: I mean like, I just feel like, if you’re totally overwhelmed, like “I can’t start”, then just go outside. Just go for a walk.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Nature is not a fad.', 'KATY: Nature is not a fad.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: What day and age is this actually?', 'KATY: Oh totally.', 'KATY: Find a grant writer.', 'KATY: Our school has received tremendous grants. But only after we got an excellent grant writer. There are a lot of people out there with a lot of income looking to invest in things that make the world better.', 'KATY: You just have to be able to communicate why what you’re doing is making the world better and there’s the research as you said, daily, you know. Oh, a great… ', ' has pages and pages and pages of research.', 'KATY: If you are looking to do a report or to create a proposal use them as a resource because they are so up to date and they have done a tremendous amount of work for you. So go check them out.', 'KATY: Great.', 'KATY: There’s also, there is for like thinking big, thinking for that special occasion thing. There are nature family camps for like the summer.', 'KATY: Where you go as a family. And all of the teachers are there and it’s all day long. And there is a, there’s a wild food family weekend that’s some of my favorite foragers teach at. And they actually take the kids for long portions. So the grown ups are over here doing things and the kids are all over here doing things. And all of the meals are included and you are and they’re all like really good quality food. So search out something like that. Because maybe you’re like, “I can’t make it in my day to day life.” But if you have a vacation fund or you do something like that, maybe think about making some sort of nature experience what you do. Even if it’s just we’re gonna camp for a week in our own town, you know, and just live outside.', 'KATY: Or camp in your backyard. There, just start engaging.', 'KATY: The end.', 'KATY: The end.', 'KATY: Do it.', 'KATY: Well, I was the headache girl.', 'KATY: Like I don’t have any.. I am very fortunate in that I don’t have nagging things any other place. Headache is my jam. And I have it.', 'KATY: Well I feel like we all have the thing. And headaches are my thing. I use my eyes intensely, right? Lots of reading. Lots of writing. My recommendations for decreasing headaches are probably less, maybe what she was asking for but since I don’t really have anything to do within the 10 or 15 minutes, maybe I do. Let me go back a little bit farther, though. One thing that I did that significantly, almost entirely eliminated my headaches was getting rid of my pillow over 18 months.', 'KATY: That was a huge trigger for me. Whatever adaptations that were in my head and neck from sleeping on a pillow had… it was almost like I was a tension headache, just a little bit of tension away from happening. I was already so tense in the neck and shoulders. Getting rid of my pillow just made my neck and shoulders so much more mobile. Also, walking. Like, I notice, if I get a headache coming on it’s like I haven’t been outside and walked long enough and so there’s a few variables that for me are noticeable. One is temperature. I’m too hot in the inside. The air is too stagnant or something. Like being really cold helps me keep off a headache. So I mean all headaches aren’t the same – it’s just for mine. Also like being able to look far away relaxes my eyes. For me, even though the tensions are in my neck or in my head, I feel like my eyes are my trigger. So lots of light, looking far away and the cold seems to be what’s going on. f I feel one coming on, boom, out for a walk. I’ll be back in an hour. Because it’s either that or be down for an hour.', 'KATY: So I figure it’s the same. Right, you’re not going to be more productive, like “Oh I can’t take the hour off work.” I’m gonna take the hour off work dealing with the headache so I might as well take the walk. And then lots of water. For me lots of protein. And so these are not what she was thinking but the last one maybe more along the lines – it’s the rhomboid push up. The rhomboid push up instead of tensing my neck and shoulders and trying to wriggle my head around to stretch it, I just go for rhomboid push ups which is you get on your hand and knees, let your head hang and you let your shoulder blades sink all the way together because, in order to get your shoulder blades together, you can’t force them there, you have to allow them there. And you have to kind of relax some of the muscles that are busy tensing your head up. So I’ll do a round of that. Get up, walk, drink water at the onset. So those are my tips. Hopefully. That’s my headache tool kit. It takes 18 months.', 'KATY: 18 months and', 'KATY: That’s a big one you know. I mean I was probably a Tylenol… I took two Tylenol once a week. Or two Tylenol once a week for… from being 16 until being 35.', 'KATY: Nope. Nope.', 'KATY: Nope.', 'KATY: Thanks, man. Autodidactic.', 'KATY: That’s not even the real word. I just totally made it up.', 'KATY: I’m a box of surprises.', 'NutritiousMovement.com', 'MoveYourBodyBetter.com', 'KATY: Bye.']"

I just – we had to get up really early, and it was really rural, and it would be chilly, because we didn’t start until September because we were a farm community.

So – it’s soccer time right now. So for example, everyone’s like, I’ve got to get soccer shoes. And they go out and they fit their kids for soccer shoes, but the best time to fit your kids – and yourself – for shoes, especially for sport-specific shoes is after you’ve done the sport. So if you’re a runner, you don’t go shoe shopping in the morning. You go take your run so that your feet are at the size – because your feet are malleable. They’re going to change shape based on the activity and the fluid content that’s in there. So you want to do it after the thing that you’ve just done, when your foot is at its maximum size or shape for whatever that activity was. So if you’re buying shoes for kids, don’t do it, like, early in the morning, before they’ve had a chance to be on their feet quite a bit or use it. You want to go out, and go hiking, go running, go playing. Let them be out for a little bit and towards the end of the day: 3, 4, 5 is a really good time to fit your kids.', 'KATY: Kids’ feet grow fast.', 'KATY: This is something that we don’t really think of as a – yeah, if you’re a parent, you know. When we just have a shoe size that we are, but your kids, their feet are growing constantly, and so the recommendation is that the shoe for a child is always at least a half of an inch longer than their foot at rest, because again – once you start moving, your foot does not maintain the static shape. It’s stretching, it’s reaching as your weight passes over it, it’s widening and lengthening. So if you fit a shoe to a static foot, which is, interestingly enough – back to school shoe shopping is also a memory of going to Payless Shoe Source and putting your foot on the thing with the sliding dial, did you have that?', 'KATY: What is it?', 'KATY: Is that the name of the – the – guy, I’m assuming, who created it?', 'KATY: It was – but – I remember as a kid, going, he’s like, we have to measure your right foot and your left foot and I was like, “why? You only sell shoes in pairs.” Like – and it was just, and I guess it was just to get the larger one, right?', 'KATY: To make sure that the pair fit the larger shoe, but anyway. Brannock device. Thank you.', 'KATY: Okay, where was I? All these interesting words –', 'KATY: Right. So – well, your foot is going to get bigger and smaller as you’re moving, so you want the shoe to fit the bigger, right?', 'KATY: But a shoe that’s too big is just as problematic as a shoe that’s too small – so what are you – so I think the natural response is like, great, well, if my kid’s foot is growing constantly through the year, then I’ll get a shoe that’s like one size too big, and then that way they can kind of grow into it over the year. Because it gets expensive, right? If you have –', 'KATY: 2-3 pairs of shoes a year.', 'KATY: You know, we really need to do a parenting episode and you can give us all of your secrets.', 'KATY: So, what do you do? You have to buy multiple pairs of shoes per year, and that gets expensive, and so in the blog post I kind of showed how I do it, right? Like, how do you delegate or dispense your shoe budget for the year, and a big secret if you want minimal shoes for kids and you don’t want to spend a lot of cash, is swim shoes.', 'KATY: What’s the other word for swim shoes? Like, water shoes, pool shoes?', 'KATY: They are – do you have another word?', 'KATY: Pool shoes. They’re usually at – around here I see them in drugstores, you know, like in the –', 'KATY: Yes.', 'KATY: No.', 'KATY: Yeah, they’re super cheap, and the cool thing about them is they’re flat. They’re flexible, and they’re inexpensive, so – and they’re usually rubber-bottomed, so even if you live in a wet place – I live in a wet place, in the Pacific Northwest. It’s not super freezing, especially in the fall, right? So I recommend that you get one of those for fall, this early part, because there might be rain on the ground but if you pair them with wool socks you’ve got something that’s warm, water-resistant, flat, flexible and it gets you through til when you’re going to need, like, your – your big guns.', 'KATY: Depending on where you live, right? If you live in Southern California, you’re like, what is she talking about? The socks, and boots.', 'KATY: Boots? But if you live in, like, where you live, you guys are going to get some snow, yeah?', 'KATY: So the best time is closer to when your foot is at the size that you’re going to be using them, so if you’re going to be wearing winter boots then try to buy them as close to winter as possible so that they’re going to match your shoe shape, then. Don’t get excited and buy your winter boots in October, I guess, is what I’m trying to say.', 'KATY: Put it off a little bit. So – and then you can buy another pair of inexpensive swim shoes in the early spring or late winter when the snow is over, but you still need a little bit of wet, and um, moccasins or other minimal shoes to kind of – it has, like, how to pace it out a little bit, I guess.', 'KATY: That’s good for adults, too.', 'KATY: And if you’re a homeschooler, a fun lesson, right? I included that actually in a blog post, a whole link to a homeschool lesson on feet and shoes, so check that out.', 'KATY: If you’re inside, sure is.', 'KATY: Yeah, and um – you know, when - we could probably do a winter show, like how to move in the winter. But that was – there were a lot of blizzards. Like East Coast, eastern Canada got hit pretty hard with winters last year where they’re like, yeah, okay, walk 3-5 miles a day is just not possible, like, it’s freezing, we will die, Katy Says. It was like, okay, well, what do you – what are ways to create movement indoors and obstacle courses, obstacle courses, obstacle courses are amazing. They’re fun to set up, they are fun for kids and adults to do. And then you can do one just for feet, though. They’re meant to be barefoot and train your feet with all sorts of wobbly, cool balancing. I threw up some pictures, and that’s a good way to strengthen the muscles in your feet, because minimal shoes, again, if you listen – I think back to our episode maybe on the Vibram lawsuit? This was like an early episode that we did –', 'KATY: -- where when you get, like, on the minimal footwear bandwagon there’s a tendency sometimes to think that just putting the shoe on the foot will give you more movement, but you actually have to be moving, right?', 'KATY: You have to be doing more movements and so – like, it’s not a magical foot massage device, like, you actually have to be up and you have to be walking over varied terrain, and if that varied terrain is buried under snow or the outside is not accessible to you, then create a varied terrain inside.', 'KATY: Oh my god, I am so cheap.', 'KATY: Oh. I’m thrifty.', 'KATY: But I don’t think it’s much as thrifty isn’t my motivation. Money saving isn’t my motivation so much as reusing things that already exist is my motivation, so, like, go now before it’s all covered under snow. Go get pebbles. Go find a cool balancing log, bring them in to dry them out now so that when it’s time to set up your winter stuff, you have all that stuff ready to go. Just get a big box. Start putting it in there and then create your kind of foot training kit in your back pocket so the first snow day when you’re like, what am I going to do? It’s like, I already have this plan. I’ve been planning on this since September. It’s fun. I enjoy it, it’s creative.', 'KATY: Walking to school. Cherished – being walked to school – cherished memories. Just, you know, um, walking to school is one of those things that has just kind of gone away –', 'KATY: -- just because of the way society is now. But escort – like, walking by yourself. I remember when I was in, like, preschool, walking certain distances myself. You know, even like a block – but that just doesn’t happen anymore, ok?', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: No, and I remember – I don’t think I thought about it then, like I think about it now. But I remember a sense of independence, and who knows how alone I was? So my son who is 4 just asked the other day if he could walk this quarter mile home by himself. He’s like, can I walk this by myself? And he asked because his 6 year old cousin does it. His mom – we live close enough, and she’ll like, ride her bike to a certain point and then she can watch him walk a certain point and then I’m at the other end and can watch, but the kid doesn’t really know that as much, and so I was like, yeah! Absolutely! And then you know, you drive home and he seemed so big all of the other times until he’s walking down this huge road and I’m like, oh my god, he’s like an ant! He’s so tiny, like a baby, crawling down this thing! And he did the whole thing! And I – there’s just a – it’s being autonomous, right? It’s this whole experience of, “I got this,” and it’s – it was a safe, you know, I felt that there was just no risks or minimal risks, I think for him. Any risk that he can handle, and um – but that’s not an option for a lot of people, so – and also people live too far from where they go to school.', 'KATY: where it’s like, okay, I’d like to have 2 extra hours to walk the three miles – you know, my kids back and forth, but I don’t, so our friend, Debbie, from Positively Aligned, has a really great solution for this, and when I went to visit her in Texas, I did this with her and it was genius, but I’ll let you tell it, because it’s just – I just like to hear it.', 'KATY: Yeah. It was great. She – so for her, or anyone else going, how can I get more movement? She would drive – I don’t remember exactly what the distance was, but it doesn’t matter – even if it’s – I have little kids, it’s like, great, then do a mile, or do a half mile. Whatever. She would park and walk in and they would play like shadow chasing games –', 'KATY: which were great –', 'KATY: Sure!', 'KATY: But that’s a benefit. That’s awesome, right?', 'KATY: Like, she got to use this time to train, and it’s like going to the gym with your kids. Here, carry all my stuff. But then she would walk back and then she would walk in to pick them up and then walk out – so she got twice as much walking as they did, half of it being fast, adult-paced, and then she got to be with them those extra hours. They got to walk, but I love that you pulled out this decompression idea. It wasn’t like, quick! Get in the car! Drive home! It was this whole, relaxing 20 or 40 minutes, however long it is for you of talking but not where people are clamoring for your attention, like, where it can be – it was just more like, we’re just out and running around, and I don’t know. It was beautiful. It felt really good. It was just a great way to break up a day.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Yeah, and I think also back to the homeschool – I like to give our alternative schoolers ideas, right? Because you’re constantly figuring out, like, cool lessons. And a good movement lesson would be for maybe older kids – or younger kids, I guess, depending on where they are – would be maybe to keep a walking journal, or to track distance.', 'KATY: Even if they’re in traditional schools, to be like, okay.', 'KATY: No.', 'KATY: Stop telling lies!', 'KATY: Mm.', 'KATY: A good idea for teachers out there, maybe, who are trying – we get a lot of requests from teachers, going, how do I adjust my curriculum? So, anyway, by doing that! That’s great.', 'KATY: All right, what else? Shoes, walking…', 'KATY: Well, that’s – I mean, going up – like, changing a paradigm is huge, so, like you have this – we are these little people with this idea and there’s institutions that have a different idea. So that’s challenging. And I think – I definitely think, it’s kind of like all activism in general, that there is benefit to organizing some sort of intervention against larger institutions that have a particular idea when you’re trying to initiate change. But before we do that, again thinking about the parent who feels overwhelmed, feeling like, Hey! Petition your school district! You know what? Just lay down in front of the desks at your school district – that seems big and overwhelming. So like the first thing you can do, so that you can feel empowered, is to simply change your home environment. So if – if people are shaped by what they do all day, then make sure that your house doesn’t – so setting up where are your kids doing homework? So if you’re like, I don’t like this desk thing, but you have desks for your kids at home, then start with eliminating that. Create standing or floor sitting desk workstations. Um, init – oh, gosh, we came up with a bunch of ideas, right?', 'KATY: Right.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: They don’t. Although the problem, I think, for a lot of people comes with – they have one home computer and the kids have to be on the home computer.

So I – ', ' the paperback version, has just been released, and I’m trying – because people still want visuals -', 'dynamic', 'KATY: It’s a dynamic office!', 'KATY: It’s dynamic! I have a low table, like find a low table. Put your computer on the low table, and then the reflex tends to be, well, there’s no way am i – the adults want to sit down there. I’m like, it’s good for you, too, this isn’t about kids; it’s about humans. But then, also, it’s not just the work time: what about the relaxation time, like, you still have the couch, you still have the EZ chairs and like, everyone’s just kind of –', 'KATY: - sitting. Everything! Like, the whole house – consider again that furniture-free home to whatever extent you can. There’s been again on our social media pages so many good ideas where the family couldn’t quite ditch the couch, so they cut the feet off of it, dropping it 4 inches. That’s huge!', 'KATY: Brilliant.', 'KATY: Brilliant. Have floor picnics, you know. Eat on the floor sometimes in the dining room. Have family challenges, where if you watch TV together as a family you do it on the floor with kind of fun movement challenges during commercial time. Also –gosh, what else?', 'KATY: Ah!', 'KATY: That’s awesome! So it’s perfect is what you mean.', 'KATY: What you’re saying is it’s perfect as it is.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: You know, I’m not such a good – again, winter.

You know – consider swapping out your furniture for something fun, family movement time instead of like, all right, we’re going to sit down at this table for an hour. Be together in some other movement way. Put your food off to the side and go get a snack when you get it, and then come and chat and play around the obstacle course or the ping-pong table or whatever else you can think of that would be fun. It’s just, uh, dynamic home. Dynamic because it’s ever changing, dynamic because it doesn’t constrict your movement in any way. So I think that’s kind of a cool thing, and then screen time, right? All the stuff that we’ve talked about before – there’s all these screen-free weeks, but can you do screen free days, or tech free days with your family? Not just with your kids, but with the whole family. You know, consider having it switch off at a certain time, where it’s like, ok, do your homework but the Internet switches off for everyone at 7. Just – just think outside the box, I guess. There are lots of solutions out there.', 'KATY: See? Parenting show, right there.', 'KATY: We’re all going to smoke our –', 'KATY: -- pretzel cigarettes outside.', 'KATY: But do it as a family. Do it as a family.', 'KATY: I just got, um, Memory? You know that Memory game? I have little, smaller kids – so we’re not at the fun – the fun, super games yet. But someone sent us – my friend Galina – a Memory game where when you matched it it was all yoga poses. So we had it every time you flipped the two cards over, everyone did the two poses that were on there.', 'KATY: And then you flip them back down, and you kept flipping around to find your match, and it was awesome.', 'KATY: It was on an Etsy – well, we can put it in the show notes.', 'KATY: It’s an Etsy – she – this woman, I think she’s Bulgarian, because Galina’s Bulgarian – and she had, she’s an artist.

I totally forgot about Twister.', 'KATY: Oh, yeah. Twister.', 'KATY: What do you mean?', 'KATY: What do you mean you don’t have to buy it?', 'KATY: Well, since this show is now about movement games, since we have this huge section – we stayed at a lake house for kind of our family end of summer hurrah, and they had a um, it wasn’t quite full, full, like – it was like a human-sized game of Jenga. Instead of the little, tiny pieces you hold in their hands, there were huge 2x4s –', 'KATY: -- that were of the appropriate ratios, and again – I have a picture of it that I put on my Instagram, and like, you squat, right? You’re picking one up at the bottom –', 'KATY: It’s not on a table anymore, you’re doing like some sort of weird, inverted squat to get the one out of the bottom, and then you’re reaching and the little kids are way over their head. They had stools climbing up to get them on there and – super fun, right? A human-sized Jenga for more movement. It’s the exact same skillset but – and you also have to sprint if it falls over, because it’s a huge pile of wood.', 'KATY: That’s right!', 'KATY: There you go!', 'KATY: Lots of fun stuff.', 'KATY: Winter show. There it is right there: indoor games.', 'KATY: Well, I have a different take on this than I think a lot of people do. So it’s a complex – it’s a complex issue, because yes, they’re carrying more stuff than we are. But I’m not sure that’s necessarily – it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Right? Giving kids more loads to carry is not problematic. It’s kind of what we’re after, right? Having them work more, be stronger. The question is, is piling a bunch of stuff into a backpack the way that we want to do it? So I don’t think – variables are tricky when you’re trying to flush out what the argument actually is. I don’t think that the problem is the weight. Weight is fine. Kids in other places do way more physical work and have the capacity to carry and be much stronger than our kids are currently. But what we have with the backpack is a repetitive load carried in a single way. Again, I don’t think that the weight is too much as much as you’re asking a child who you also ask to be sedentary the bulk of the time to then carry this large burden on their spine, you know. So what is the solution there? The solution there is carrying the load in different ways. I, for a long time, have wanted to create a backpack that was similar - and sorry, fellas, if this analogy doesn’t make sense. But you know, like, you can buy those bras that are like 5 bras in one? It’s like, it’s over the shoulder and it crisscrosses in back!', 'KATY: And it’s strapless. So I have long time wanted to create some sort of carrying device that had straps that went in different ways, where you can carry it in different ways. You can, of course, carry a backpack however you want, but you know, we’re talking about – I don’t know, are little kids, are 5 and 6 year olds coming home with 30 pound backpacks? Or when does that phenomenon start? I actually don’t know.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: Which one? Are you a lefty or a righty?', 'KATY: Sure. Right.', 'KATY: You’re like, who are you talking to?', 'KATY: I’m saying that – I’m saying that you know, we have an aversion to work and weight and movement. And so it’s easy to see, like, look at all this weight they’re asking the kids to carry, and I’m like, yeah, kids are strong. They should be asked to carry a lot more stuff a lot more often. However - is a backpack - this consolidated load placed on the spine, like, I would find that to be the problem more so than asking them to carry the weight.', 'KATY: And so – my kids go to outdoor school, too. They have backpacks, and it’s a little more challenging with tiny – with smaller kids, but keep in mind that they’re also laboring kids, so they are constantly asked to carry and move and hang and swing, and so their bodies wouldn’t collapse under the weight of a backpack the same way someone who did not that much other strength exercise throughout their life would collapse in a backpack. The effect of a backpack is not in a vacuum; it depends on who’s wearing it and what they do all the other time.', 'KATY: So for older kids, like your son, varying up how you carry your backpack – and I wrote the pumpkin blog – there’s a pumpkin loads – It’s the Great Loads Lesson, Charlie Brown was one of my annual – the annual lessons I do on pumpkins. I always seem to do a blog once a year with a pumpkin. And so – you know, what’s the difference between carrying 10 pounds of pumpkins all stuffed in a backpack vs. carrying one on your head and a couple on your arms? That weight and how it’s distributed changes the net effect of something, and so – I remember it being cool to not have a backpack, but to have like 3 books in one arm? Right? Do you ever remember walking home just carrying your books with like, papers sticking out?', 'th', 'KATY: But again, I wasn’t cool, so maybe it’s just what I did.', 'KATY: Ooh, two. Two. Because my glasses went over my right and left ear, so my straps had to go over my right – I had to balance the whole thing out, you know? And my – and my permed hair was equally poofy – I was all about symmetry. I was all about – I needed to be a symmetrically a nerd.', 'KATY: My mom said I was adorable.', 'KATY: Messenger bags. I did get into me – like, I still prefer, like I don’t do any – I like an over the shoulder strap. So over the shoulder strap – do it one way and then the other way, put your backpack on the front. There were a couple kids who did that. You know, carry their backpack on the front like a big pregnancy belly? That’s pretty hip. You should ask your son if that’s hip. You should just start wearing your backpack on the front of your body and see what he says.', 'KATY: And then put your butt pack on the back, and your – oh, my gosh.', 'KATY: I know. Okay, but – but all of that being said, if you are going – there’s my little kid is carrying all this crazy stuff – lighten their load a little bit with – like, I – we were buying stuff for outdoor school, and it’s like a huge, massive lunchbox, and I was like, what’s this huge, heavy – in outdoor school, because they are hiking, you know, they’re not just wearing the backpack around in between classes – these little kids are hiking a couple miles with what’s on their back. So I do things like, they don’t have lunchboxes. Those are heavy. They have a knit sack – a mesh sack – that I put their food in, because why have the extra weight of a backpack? Look for, you know, water bottles. Look when you’re purchasing items for back to school or what they carry with them on a regular basis, pick things that are lighter.', 'KATY: Eliminate the need for – you know, do you need a pencil box? I mean, understanding that we all need a pencil box, do you really need a heavy pencil box in your bag, or could you just, you know, throw a couple pencils in your backpack? Like, there are – there is extra weight being placed in there, and extra bulk that may or may not be necessary, so backpackers will understand that you pare down your weight and don’t take non-essential items. So. Just – I don’t know. I guess other things to think about if um, if the load really is too heavy for the strength of your child right now. Pare it down.', 'KATY: As much as you can, like, they still have to bring – can you photograph, or can you buy a duplicate set of textbooks? Some schools do that, right? Like, send their kids home with duplicates? Can you buy, you know, find used online duplicate textbooks so they’re not moving it back and forth?', 'KATY: Yeah, and it’s – you know, we think, my kids are carrying too much weight! And then the next question is: how do I exercise my kids more? It’s like, we know where –', 'KATY: We are living in the space between two paradigms right now. So you’re getting a little bit of this information, but you’re still within the culture that really goes out of its way to avoid movement, and so there’s this – we live outside of a Venn diagram. We live in this space and it’s slowly overlapping, but it takes a while to start hearing, you know, the questions you’re asking. How, like this is too much work for my child and it’s like, well, too much work is relative. Is there – as your children get stronger and understand variability then it won’t be.', 'KATY: So. Anyway. That’s just, uh, again, it’s part of that broader understanding of ergonomics vs. movement, and movement vs. exercise, but I think we got a shout-out in there for working more.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Well, that’s – that’s where change comes from. It comes from super passionate people doing the work. I mean, it’s just work. All this trying to create new curriculum – it’s work. It’s really challenging. I don’t think that there’s a teacher out there who – I mean, I shouldn’t say that. There are many teachers out there who are like, I totally get that sitting in the chairs is not good for the students but it’s the way that the system is set up –', 'KATY: - and I’m just one person, and in order to change it I would have to have a year paid by someone else where I didn’t have to teach but could just write curriculum. I’ve been working on my curriculum for so long; but there are these people out there who are so passionate about it that they are, in their spare time, creating ideas and curriculum out there to change, I think, the paradigm. And so I would like to point people to a couple of those sources, um, one of them that I’m really excited about it – have you ever met Alex Kane?', 'KATY: So Alex Kane, he is um, he’s married to one of our graduates who is a teacher of the movement technique that we use and he was also an American Ninja contestant.', 'KATY: You didn’t? Oh, my gosh.', 'KATY: Yes, he’s – he’s physically amazing.', 'KATY: The only thing kind of being more amazing than his physical capacity is his warmth, and his passion for his community and his family, and for movement. And so he has a website – Monkey Bar Math™. He’s a teacher, and I wrote a blog post about him a couple years ago because he created a chair-free classroom and – but he didn’t just go, hey kids, we’re having a chair-free classroom. The first day of school he was like, Hey, there’s no furniture in here, what are we going to do? And then, you know, it just opens discussions with kids and how do you want to set up the space? And the curriculum was creating a learning space. And so his website, Monkey Bar Math™, is really insightful about what are the subjects that we can start teaching via movement? And so – anyway, go check that out, and then you have some favorites?', 'KATY: And I think – you know, I just – that triggered something in me. I think that a lot of the resistance to doing new things in larger institutions is the cost, right? It’s like, well –', 'KATY: -- we can’t afford it. Totally -', 'KATY: There’s never money. I totally get that. Um, and I think, though, a lot of that comes from the idea that you don’t want your kid to go to be schooled in a place that has mismatching – you know, if you said, no problem! You know, all the parents will come together and donate pieces of various heights, and that when you go to that school, there could be the response of like, well, this is sloppy.', 'KATY: This is mish-mosh and different heights, and I have been conditioned to uniformity and brand new-ness, and I – I am inferring from this way of everything looking organized that then what happens here is good, and that things that are not clean and disorganized based on my internal um, judgment system, can’t – good things can’t happen here. And that – just for any of you that have ever looked at anything that I’ve put out as far as like, the videos that I’m doing or whatnot. One of the reasons I film, you know, what I do with, you know, my kids in the background – you know – that – that you always want to make sure that you’re evaluating things by the outcome, not necessarily by the appearance of how it looks. And that could be, you know, this idea of what is good, or what is bad based on how it looks might be this huge cultural cast kind of on what is keeping things being the same way over and over again.', 'KATY: So just – it’s internal judgment system that is a culturally conditioned – so, anyway. That’s just one thing.

So, the line that in question is on page 104 in "", ' or I don\'t know what page if you have an e-book. It says quote: ""The callus that will develop from walking outside will have the best circulation and the most cellular activity of any part of the foot."" That, well, let me go to the second part. I\'ve also noted this, I noted this phenomenon first in ', "" which has now been reissued as Simple Steps to Foot Pain Relief. And that's on page 16, and that text says: (clears throat) me me me me me..."", 'KATY: Oh exactly! ""Calluses are areas of the skin that have better circulation than other areas.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'KATY: Well.', ""KATY: Oh my gosh we're gonna talk about dead skin. I'm so excited!"", ""KATY: So, they're both poorly written sentences and I just read a "", ' that said like, ""Beware of death by a misprint when you\'re reading a health book"" or something like that. So this is, this is like a panda eats shoots and leaves types of things. calluses are the area of the skin that have better circulation than other areas of the skin - so first of all, like in', "", the fact that is says that a callus has better circulation and more cellular activity than any other part of the foot. That's not right. It should say foot skin. But it only says foot. So it should say foot skin. And then technically, I'm going to go through layers of the skin because it's a semantics issue and I want to be super technical. But you will see the degree of explanation the technicality requires but, more accurate it would say the skin beneath the callus, the layers of skin beneath the layer of skin that we would refer to when built up to a certain point is a callus, have better circulation than other area of the skin or non-callused areas of the skin. I will make those changes in subsequent print."", ""KATY: So that's what happens when you ask a really great technical question like that, it's like oh yeah, I could have made better word choices here to make it clear because the upper layers of your skin, or the outer layers, the part that's less deep, the part that's superficial is your epidermis. The epidermis is avascular meaning it does not have a blood supply."", ""KATY: Avascular. You have to say the word after you spell it if you're gonna win the spelling bee."", 'KATY: Yes. So dead is the word and it\'s always, ""I thought they were dead"". So I don\'t know where to start first. Calluses don\'t bleed when you cut them because the entire epidermis is avascular. It does not have a blood supply. So I think that why the confusion is, is what I\'m thinking when I write better circulation to the callus, which is, like ', ""? It's like one of those types of questions. So before we talk about it, let me just explain skin very quickly. I mean as quickly as I can which is not quickly at all. So you've got the outer layers which is the epidermis and below that you have the dermis. In the dermis is the blood supply. The epidermis has 5 layers to itself as well. So the avascular portion is 5 layers. Below that is the dermis and I'm not a skin expert and so that's why it took me so long to work through all those articles because this is half reading like a foreign language to me. It's very complicated. But anyway, the more you learn about something the more you realize how complex it is and it's like oh my goodness."", 'KATY: Epidermis has 5 layers.', ""KATY: Well and I think that it depends on what you're reading, right? If you're reading something simple like my book, which is a lay person's book not about skin. It just throws out that the callus area of the skin has better circulation. It doesn't talk about what that actually means because what does better circulation actually mean? But anyway, the bottom layer of the epidermis is the basal cell. That's the layer that is generating cells. It is generating cells. I don't know if dead is the right term for that layer that is generating cells. I will get ... cells not sales. I will get back to why dead, where dead probably came from. Just remind me."", ""KATY: So you've got the basal layer that is creating cells and it's the proliferation area. The next layer, and so this is where naming things like, things are named when something about them usually changes. Like how we have named things is usually based on some visual difference. And so the cells, as they start, so we're only in the epidermis right now, and at the base of the epidermis is also where the mechanical sensors are. So you've got the base cells which are measuring the stresses to all the layers above it. And maybe even below it. I don't know. If it's taking in external data, then it's measuring how much the skin is being pushed or pulled. And that is sending the signal for generation. In areas that don't have much movement the proliferation rate is one thing. In areas that do have a lot of movement - areas that are under greater pressure or shear or tension, being moved around a lot - that signals hyperproliferation which means the rate of cell growth is greater."", ""KATY: So as those cells, those cells have keratin which is a particular fiber, and as it moves up through the layers the layers are made of the cells differentiating ... and I don't know if these terms are exactly right - I'm not a cellular biologist but like in general the cells are, they're changing and as they go through their process of change they're pushed up by the layer of growth that's beneath them. And so each one of these 5 layers is really just the layer because of what process the cell is - what features the cells have. Like how much keratin the cells have at this point - it's k-e-r-a-t-i-n if you want to look it up. And I'll put sources in the show notes if you want to go look them up."", ""KATY: And it loses, it has a nucleus at the beginning but by the time it gets to the end stage, by the time it makes its way up to the stratum corneum, the outside edge, it no longer has a nucleus. So it lost it nucleus so the lack of nucleus is perhaps what one stage is called and then as the keratin is going through its process of change every time it changes visually, that's a different layer. So that's what those multiple layers are within it. It is just the cells being pushed up from the bottom and moving outward. At the same time, skin's being sloughed off always, right? You're always losing skin. And what I learned is a callus is not only hyperproliferation... an area, a callused area of the skin ... so you're stratum corneum which is the most outside of the dermis, surrounds your entire body. Everyone has a stratum corneum. I mean most everyone unless there's some trauma."", ""KATY: Strata is layer corneum is horn, hard. It's the horned layer."", 'KATY: Where was I.', 'KATY: Yes. ', "". And also what I just learned of the stratum lucidum which I think is the layer right below it is it's all clear, which we'll figure out why that's important a little bit later. So in addition to being hyperproliferation in a callus, the adhesion molecules are greater in those layers that are being mechanically stressed more so than other layers. So it's not only that there are simply more cells, the cells are more connected to the surrounding cells."", ""KATY: That's what adhesion molecules are. So it makes that area less flexible and less penetrable."", ""KATY: Right. Like that's why, like I'm walking around my backyard the other day, I get things stuck in my foot all of the time. I mean I walk on things that are pokey and things that have soft prongs just get bent that would have normally gone in the softer areas of my skin; the less callused areas of my skin, would go in. Now those just get deformed because my skin tension is greater than what they can penetrate. It's less penetrable. And ..."", 'KATY: Exactly. But also when things do go in... it is penetrated a lot by like a goat head.', ""KATY: Yes, but, I don't feel them. I don't feel them. I'm aware that, like I can feel the pressure that it is sticking in my foot. I can see that it's sticking in my foot, but I don't have a pain to it sticking in my foot. Because I don't know because I think the mass is thicker to where ever it has to go to perhaps to interact with a particular, create a particular signal. I don't know but that's my experience being one who steps on lots of things."", 'KATY: So anyway, ', "". Ok. So a callus is not really a thing. I mean you can define a border around an area of the stratum corneum but that's all it is. It's a relatively thicker stronger area. It's a thicker stronger area of the stratum corneum compared to the stratum corneum that surrounds it. Now vascular wise... so I recognize that the writing was poor right off and I'll make that change. Thank you. But I also wanted to get a reference for it because that's what she initially asked for."", 'KATY: So I went, I first learned this when I was writing my first book, and I was writing it with my friend who was also a podiatrist at the time and this was kind of common knowledge just through our university. I, when we were there talking about it as I was putting it in, I remember reading something that said it explicitly but I don\'t know what that thing was so I was like, ""Well I\'ll just go find it."" So I went to go find it and I can find nothing that actually measures the vascularization of a callused area versus a non-callused area. So, you know, when you\'re going to school the bulk of your education is coming through - I mean you\'re reading a textbook but the bulk of it is what\'s being told to you by your professors. And when they were learning, some of it came from textbooks but the bulk of it was coming from from what was their professors. So there are lots of common knowledge things that you don\'t actually know that there\'s a source of and you kind of wade through them later on and this is one of those things. What is known, and I think that this is where it comes from and there could be other data on it that was done way earlier on ... like so much of the blood flow and circulation to the foot is from the 20s and 30s. Really early. They\'ve stopped really investigating the baseline human physiology because they think that they know it all.', ""KATY: I mean that's commonly expressed that pretty much all anatomical discoveries have already been made is the general thought process."", 'KATY: So when they find something new like when they found that the brain had a lymphatic system, that was actually a statement. Like, ""We thought all the basic anatomy research had been done."" But here\'s how, so when you have a callus, ', '. When you step on it, so when you step on your foot the place with the greatest amount of pressure has the ', "". In that moment of bearing down on your body, your body sends in extra blood to that area. Kind of like putting on a weight belt. Like to increase its pressure so that you don't crush the structures within there."", 'KATY: So every time you step on an area of pressure, your body moves blood to that area. ', "" to that area as you are moving over it. Which is why the callus is there. And then also the callus is the area of, kind of the greatest cellular growth compared to other areas of the skin because it's having ... because of the pressure, it's having to hyper-proliferate. Right? It's extremely active. What are the effects of the growth on the blood flow? I don't know. Like at the most basic level if something is extra active - an area is extra active - that is going to pull extra resources to fuel that activity. But that's the dermis that we're talking about. So, that's always been my basic answer to the email. Yes, there's no blood flow in calluses. I'm talking about the callused area of the foot. The vascularization of the skin of the callused area. Which includes the avascular part but also the non-avascular. So those references are linked in the show notes so that you can see how a callus..."", ""KATY: Now what's interesting is when people have... calluses are often recommended being removed in people who have diabetes because that mechanism of stepping on a pressured area and having the blood come in where the vasodilation happens mechanically in response to the pressure on the load?"", ""KATY: Doesn't happen in people with diabetes."", ""KATY: That's one of the hallmarks. So a callus can be an area where you are just bearing down on a part of your body that eventually can damage those tissues ..."", ""KATY: and become a potential sore later on. So that's why we cut them off. I can't read anything about a callus online besides maybe one or two articles explaining mechanism that don't refer to a callus as a pathology."", ""KATY: It is almost exclusively viewed as a pathology. Nowhere is it mentioned like the benefits of a well-distributed foot callus. Or maybe we should talk about it differently. Because it's not a callus that we're after. We're after a thick corneum. It's hyper-keratinized so it is a callus but the callus is so ingrained with the pathology and anything that you read that the thing that I'm talking about which is the entire surface of your foot being thick, we need a different term for whatever that is."", ""KATY: I'll just call it a fully distributed callus. But that's what we're after. We are not after..."", 'KATY: Those three dots.', ""KATY: Yeah. So it's a layer. It's a layer that we're after. It's one of those things like the benefits of circulation, I mean certainly as far as cellular behavior, that's in response to load, and so is the circulatory benefit. So you're not after trying to build a callus so that you can sit and just enjoy palms and the soles of your feet with better circulation. The circulation comes from when you're using them, right? So my whole point with this is that callused areas are areas like they're not ill areas. They're areas that are well vascularized and very dynamic and growing and changing.They're not ill spots on your body. However, in a context where there is not very much movement at all, they become an issue because when your pressure is in such a tiny spot highly repetitively, then you end up, kind of getting one deep core of thick tissue around soft tissue. Now you have a stress riser and now it's making an injury. Now that core is deforming or tearing other tissues. Not only when you use it but eventually maybe crushing the blood vessels below. So that is, I think the answer to the question. The question is the callused area circulates better simply because, in a person without this particular peripheral arterial disease, because when you step on it, the pressure, like the body's response is to pull blood and infuse blood into that area. So that area is well circulated. Not the callus itself. There's no extra blood vessels growing into the callus."", ""KATY: Ok so that's the next piece. So anyway, I wanted to make sure that I've answered the question and that you'll agree that I've answered the question. So you have the source for the pressure and the mechanism of "", "" an area of the skin. This is how the skin behaves under pressure. And also what a callus is: avascular. And then I'll change a text so it reads less confusing. And when you make changes to a book there's a particular layout. So I can't really ever add a paragraph to a book because that means the entire book needs to be re-indexed and it shifts."", ""KATY: Oh yeah. You can't just add to a book. Every picture and every box lines up so you basically have to re-do the book anytime you do more than just change a couple key words. But that being said, I will adjust that with as minimal words as I can to make it more accurate and less confusing."", 'KATY: Now, I started thinking about the skin being avascular. And in reading a copious amount of literature on the layers of the skin I came to more recent pieces that I will also', '. Like they used ""dead"" in air quotes. It has no nucleus and it\'s avascular and so that\'s why I think ""dead""... so like there\'s five layers. You could say that the... they say that the epidermis is dead. They say. The epidermis is dead but really you\'ve got an active basal level that\'s proliferating and you have nuclei and different organelles up through a couple of the layers. So if we were just to say that alive meant that it was active or had a nucleus then we would have to say that the epidermis as a total isn\'t dead. So I use the word ""dead"" also.', 'KATY: I\'m going to have to go back and change the places I used ""dead"" in both, I mean, in any of the books with skin. So I think I used the word dead in the foot book, the first foot book. The ', "". I don't think I used it in any of the others. Like, man, I've got all kinds of edits. No. So the first two layers are living because they're actually doing something and then the other three are dead. But then I'm reading this other stuff and it's like "", "". These layers are responding and changing their behavior. There's a moisturizing factor that's nourishing the upper cells that's coming from not the bottom two layers in response to use and load and so I would say that the sentiment is that they're not, it's not actually dead at all. It's just not connected to a blood supply directly. So it's avascular. And the cells don't have nuclei, but they are active and they are doing something. They are not dead at all. And then are you ready for this? This is the thing that has blown my mind. So these very important, very active, non-vascular cells are doing. So the problem that that creates for me is, you can't do without an energy supply. Right?"", ""KATY: I can't even stand it... your skin extracts oxygen from the air."", 'KATY: ', '.', ""KATY: It's breathing."", ""KATY: Your skin. So this... I can't even like my mind... my mind is blown."", 'KATY: So your skin operates very similar to a tree.', ""KATY: I'm gonna"", "" so you can verify it for yourself. Don't take the KatySays word for it cuz you never know how poorly I've been writing or saying some things, but."", 'KATY: But you can consult the authors of: ""', '."" So your skin is breathing. It\'s exchanging oxygen directly with the air. So I think before the understanding was the upper layers are dead and nonactive and so the diffusion of the blood in the dermis was enough to nourish maybe the basal, like the active level, but all other levels were just in the process of dying and they didn\'t need anything. So this makes so much more sense to me because the skin is the farthest thing away from the oxygen that you\'ve taken into your body. Like it\'s like the oxygen would have to travel the farthest to make it to your skin. Does that make sense?', ""KATY: The blood vessels are the deepest and as you go up there's all these other tissues that are eating which means your skin would get the dregs. But your skin is your greatest defense against your environment. So the fact that you're greatest defense would be on the dregs made no sense to me. This makes so much sense to me. You know, the fact that your greatest defense is dead also makes no sense to me. So yeah, this is amazing that your skin can uptake almost enough oxygen to tend to itself that it's in a relationship directly with the air that it is placed in. Which then, of course, brings up all the other questions about what we do to our skin."", ""KATY: Well it's an organ right?"", ""KATY: An organ that's been placed in a particular environment and that environment is, I mean there's scars and tattoos and clothing and topicals..."", 'KATY: ...sun exposure, lack of sun exposure, movement of the hairs on your skin. Like how does all of that play, I don\'t know. The fact that this was almost buried. And when I read it I was like, are you saying that skin breathed? And then I type in ""does skin breathe"" and then the first 100 things are like don\'t be ridiculous, that\'s just a, like your skin doesn\'t breathe and there\'s all these credible sources that are like, you can\'t breathe through your skin. I\'m like, that\'s not what I asked. I didn\'t ask if your body is pulling in oxygen for your body through your skin. I\'m asking, does your skin get its oxygen on its own. And it does. And that is blowing my mind. And I would have never found it if it wasn\'t for this question going through.', ""KATY: I do. Emily from the bottom, bottom, bottom of my heart, soul, and mind, and skin. Like if I, like to me this is one of those big, it's another big shift of recognizing one, a mechanism of nature, right, which is generally understood to be non-human stuff, as being fully activated in my body right now. Like it just makes me that much closer to other non-human, non-animal life even. It's like more closely related to plants and you can see the similarity in our behavior. It just, it makes the role of skin as related to natural movement and temperature, it opens up so much more about that. And not that there isn't anything else even known about it, but just the fact that it's there, opens my mind tremendously. And there's nothing I enjoy more than having my mind opened. So again, thank you for that. But here's the other thing; the next thing I'm thinking of, is a callused are more oxygen rich because there's more mass there? That would mean that like if a callus has more to keep alive, is it actually pulling in more oxygen. So I don't understand the mechanism. There's gotta be some, it's going to be... I mean you're dealing with oxygen uptake, like a gas expert or someone who could explain the physical components of skin and what is actually skin occlusion mean? Like how, if I cover my skin with cotton, that's totally different than covering my skin with Saran Wrap."", ""KATY: So we have materials that breathe. That was like, oh, ok. Like I breathable clothing now makes me, I can see the mechanical role of that a little bit more, right? So it's just blowing my mind. So anyway, I don't get this or really most of anything frankly."", ""KATY: But I'm interested in, like does oil occlude it? Like if I put oil on is that depriving an area or is there a certain amount of absorption and then once it's absorbed it facilitates more oxygen? Like I don't know any of those things but some really smart person out there, go look at that and then come back and let us know."", ""KATY: Well just think of anything that affects your ability to extract oxygen from the air with your mouth, those could also be at play through the oxygen of your skin. So like if you're area where the air quality is very low, they're also saying that they think that this has a lot to do with flight or altitude physiology. You submerge yourself regularly, your skin isn't able to extract what it needs as a defense barrier so the overall demand on being in thin air environments is very high. Two fold, not only what you're pulling in your body but what you're able to, how your skin is able to support itself. So, I was just like oh my gosh."", ""KATY: This is why I don't like to know about things because it occupied 16 hours of my life. And I don't know if my life, if I don't utilize the information personally, those 16 hours weren't, you know, worth it just for the act of discovery. I'm personally nourished by the act of discovery but that's not, it cuts into my actual nourishment. But I took my pants off. I did it outside at the computer. I was like taking off my clothes. I can implement getting more oxygen right now. Let's just get naked and so I have to use it. In order to justify taking so much of my life to learn about it, I have to start using it right away. So I'm just like I'm getting dressed differently. I'm looking at my skin tenderly going oh my gosh you've been breathing. And what happens when I have a ring on?"", 'KATY: It goes on and on and on.', 'KATY: So, question answered you think?', ""KATY: It wasn't a reprint. It's just mostly to change the word from a callus to a callused are of the skin."", ""KATY: But even that's challenging because does that mean... a callused area of the skin includes all the layers of it, including the hypodermis. Right? So, without getting into the layers of the skin, I'm not sure an easier way to say it, except the area, the area of skin that is callused or, I don't know. Maybe some editor can maybe help me with just how to say that the depth of skin, the area of skin, to many people, the area of skin that is callus will be limited to the stratum corneum. They will not see that the callused skin is the depth of skin that is callused. And that's what I'm speaking of. So I might just have to add the depth of skin that is callused. But that's very confusing. And when I write like that, those are often removed because this is difficult to parse without three other paragraphs explaining it."", ""KATY: So sometimes I just let it go. When I've answered this live, I say, I'm talking about the layers of skin deep to the callus as being more vascularized. Not the extra density of a callus. But anyway, it's my job to figure that out. Not yours. Either way, a revision will be made and hopefully, a better understanding is held by all who listen to the podcast."", 'KATY: Do it.', 'KATY: Great.', 'KATY: Tremendously.', 'KATY: Tremendously.

64,['81'],between the lines (part two) – ,"['All about Alignment Matters and Movement Matters, in which Katy Bowman tells Stephanie Domet why most of her readers lean either Alignment Matters or Movement Matters, what Nietzsche has to do with it, and leaves us with a move to chew on.', 'Overview', 'Jump to section', 'Jump to section', 'Jump to section', 'Jump to section', 'Jump to section', 'Jump to section', 'Resources\xa0', 'on Wikipedia', 'the car and stress risers', 'nutritiousmovement.com', 'Podcast Transcript', 'KATY: I am Katy Bowman, you probably have guessed that by now, author of a lot of books but, Move Your DNA, right? Would be the most popular one probably.', ""KATY: Right. Exactly. That's good. She's thrown a lot. She's a good person to pick up after."", 'KATY: Exactly.', 'KATY: Then there\'s another group of people who I think who move a lot whether they\'re ranchers or farmers. They are maybe doing these really large movement feats. Very powerful moves. I mean I think of Parkour or you know some of the larger feats of MovNat, right? Like they\'re doing these incredible, incredible things. And there\'s a large group of people who have always moved a ton and they, I think, have maybe come through, I mean certainly some have come through Alignment Matters, but I think that Movement Matters is this other idea of ""Oh, I need more movement in my life."" They\'re not thinking about where their elbows and shoulders and knees and hips are during that movement but the idea of, ""I\'m gonna walk to the store instead of driving. I\'m gonna get rid of my furniture."" You know, like these larger ideas. They enter the work through that. So they\'re not necessarily thinking about the refinement of body position as much as they are thinking about infusing movement into their life. Then there\'s another group who has entered more through, not necessarily moving a ton more but really really refining the movements that they are already are doing. And of course, everyone is working towards expanding. So, in general, it seems that people are coming either through the Alignment Matters portal - and it\'s all alignment, that\'s the thing. But they\'re gonna come through that book, that Alignment Matters portal. Or they\'re gonna come through the Movement Matters, ""Oh, I\'m gonna move more for my own stuff. I\'m gonna start grinding my coffee"" and all these things. Where my ultimate goal for me would be for maybe everyone to be maybe grinding their own coffee but also maybe considering their shoulder position while they do it. Right? The intersection of those two things, which is, I wrote a blog post on this a long time ago. I used to write every year a ""State of the Union"" of the blog. My blog in 2014, My blog in 2015. So if you want to go back we can find this one. But what I would want to tell the Movement Matters people is that to your large volume of movement that you want to cultivate, there is some refinement that might get you toward your end goal. It might allow you to hit that direct target a little bit more easily. Because I get a lot of people who would say, ""I\'ve been barefoot my entire life."" Like they didn\'t need to read Whole Body Barefoot.', 'KATY: They\'ve always been barefoot. Yet they will have some of the same conditions as the person who has worn the shoe their entire life who is like, ""I just started spreading my toes and lifting my toes. I\'m not ready to go barefoot quite yet."" Or they haven\'t lived 40 years of barefoot. So then there\'s information for both of those groups of people, it\'s like, yes, well the alignment, the more refined position of your body, if barefoot\'s the only thing that you did, if you\'re sitting quite a bit or you still have these positional habits or these weaknesses or these strengths, that\'s gonna load that one spot kind of in the same way as if you wore a shoe the whole entire time. So I think I tend to lean more toward the alignment interest initially. That\'s why I went into biomechanics, so I\'d have that toolbox. However my interest in movement overall I realize oh I need both, I need both pieces. You can\'t really get to understand movement as a science, as a phenomenon, without broadening past the alignment, the very narrow body position relative to body position. You have to think about a greater context. So, I wish to infuse more nit-picky alignment into the Movement Matters group and also the Alignment Matters group oftentimes has difficulty actually really significantly increasing their total number of minutes. Meaning it\'s very easy, biomechanics can be very heady. You know working with tiny body parts can be so thrilling that you go deeper. Meaning for that one exercise that you\'re doing you can keep adding more and more body parts to pay attention to. But you never really move beyond that one exercise that you were doing it in. So you\'re moving more in the sense that you\'re considering more of your parts but the frequency of your movement isn\'t radically increasing so I wish to infuse in that group more of the Movement Matters principles so they can understand here\'s the aspects of movement and that movement science of why you really do need to be moving more outside of that exercise or alignment session. Into the Movement Matters group. It\'s like, you\'re moving a ton but did you know that you have got these really old compensation patterns and the way that you\'re moving through your high frequency is really reinforcing this one particular shape and if you can just tweak this little thing it would be different. So that\'s why they need to be integrated.', 'KATY: Right. Exactly.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Why would anyone want to do that?', ""KATY: I know. Such a strange thing. Well, I wrote a ton. I was very productive between 2007 and 2011. Right? Those were before I had kids. And arguably I'm still productive but as far as, I'm pretty darn productive but I had fleshed out so much. I mean there was a point where I was blogging every single day and, you know, the blogs aren't, they're not spectacular, per se. I always find there's a spectacular nugget buried under like crappy writing and way crappy drawings and picture, you know, fast pictures. Because to me, it was more like the container, you know, when I give a gift..."", ""KATY: I'm like the stuff it in a pillow case, paper bag kind of person. I don't wrap things beautifully and..."", ""KATY: No. It's not my personality. Because I was like, there is so much... and I recognize now that the beauty of something is for many people as we talked about before, it's that key. It's that portal. Where if it's not beautiful they can't even receive the gift."", 'KATY: And that\'s fine. It just means it\'s gonna be a lot harder to extract information from me. They\'re like, ""When are you gonna redo this so it\'s better quality?"" I was like, never.', 'KATY: The nugget is there. That nugget is there. So you can choose to accept it, a great gift in a crappy bag or you can just realize that you appreciate the wrapping of things and both of those things are fine but it\'s gonna be a difficult time wading through. So I would say that I grew in terms of my reach significantly over 2007 and 2011 and the questions and emails started coming and I just realized that a lot of people weren\'t, like me, going back and reading through blog archives. They would be pulled to a single article that was great and it was like ""Wonderful, I want more of this."" And then they would just have questions without really knowing that you could go back and just read all the archives of a blog. You know, often times you can just work through other people\'s work to find it. And it was just not happening easily and then, you know, I was\xa0looking at my own body of work and going, ""Wow, this is robust."" And it\'s hard because I\'m writing things as I integrate and idea. I have an idea, I connect two pieces and I was like, ""Oh this is cool. I\'m gonna write this down."" Like my blog has always been blurting. It\'s basically like blurting out any thought that I had and I wrote it down. Or sometimes...\xa0', 'I remember one time I was walking by, I was on a ferry and someone had drilled to the top of their car, they had made a camping, you know those plastic tubs that people have professionally connected and installed to the top of their roof for camping or gear or whatever...', ""KATY: Someone had made one of those out of wood. It was just a wood box. That they had bolted to the top of their car. And I could see and I was taking a picture of it as I walked by. And was like, there's a stress riser. This is a really good example of where, where someone has an artificial joint at the interface between when you've introduced a cut into the hood of your roof, right? So now it's stronger as a continuous material than when you drill a hole through it. And then when you bolt something to it that the wind is going to press against that thing on top now and wear as that wood... I feel like I should put up the pictures now so everyone can really enjoy what I'm trying to describe. As the wind was pushing against the wood box on the top...I mean there was not even any extra straps to reduce...it's gonna create a lift. It's gonna be pushed by the wind. And that's gonna be constantly prying that wood box away from the car. And it's connected and that's fine. But the point at which that prying is working is at that, where the joints, where the bolts are connected to the metal roof of the car. And you can see the metal roof of the car was starting to be thinned and pulled away. "", '. I would take a picture and I would just write a blog about that. I used so many non-body examples to talk about the body. Which is, I think, what Alignment Matters is really great ... it\'s really heavy in. Which is you already have so much understanding of physics and complex systems because you live in one? It\'s just that no one ever told you, if you go and look at that thing you\'re gonna go, you don\'t have to be an engineer to be like, ""That\'s like wearing that down."" But for some reason, we have these different perceptions of our bodies are and how they work. And Alignment Matters was just, I thought, and there were so many examples of that and there were so many articles. That book, I have it right here. This book is the densest book of all the books.', ""KATY: It's 400 - almost 450 pages. And I just thought, well, that's kind of a fun primer. And it was written in short blog posts, essays, which I like. I like short stories. So I thought, this is a really great non-overwhelming, like if you, someone plopped down a 450-page biomechanics book and this idea that how you move was affecting your health and that you could make these subtle adjustments and how to think about measuring ... there's so many topics in there. If someone plopped it down and it was just one long book it would be barely accessible to anyone. Only the truest of body alignment nerds would even have the context to wade through it. But I thought this is an abundant amount of work and I'm going to compile it, organize it, right. Because I didn't write anything in order."", ""KATY: So it's totally out of order. And sometimes I write complex things first and then I'll go back and refine the simple things later and sometimes it's the other way around. Sometimes you put the simple thing first."", 'KATY: And if you\'d be reading an article you\'d be like, I imagine... for me, I see my entire blog as a single body of work. You know you can\'t, you can\'t ... I was just reading on twitter the other day, someone had tweeted a sentence and they were attacked ""you didn\'t include this.."" I was like, ""I get 140 characters"". Like when you\'re writing, you have to leave, you are leaving things out all of the time. Every time you have a conversation, every time you put pen to paper, every time you type anything out, you have removed almost everything...', 'KATY: ... you know editing is going on 100% of the time. In everything.', 'KATY: Oh sure. If you call,', 'KATY: I mean I\'m even talking about if I talk to my mom on the phone and she says, ""How is your day?"" The one thing that I choose to say I\'ve left out all of the actual things that what my day entailed, right?', 'KATY: So that is a necessity. But as a body... so people would read one or two articles and have questions and I was like, ""Go back and read the blog."" Well, that\'s kind of a ridiculous request. Who\'s gonna go read a blog? But ""go read the book"", that\'s a little bit easier. And I thought well we can take some time to edit it. Because, you know, blurting comes with kind of garbled... It\'s not overly edited. I would love to rewrite everything because I would write it in an entirely different way. However, Penelope, our editor, she was like, ""No, it really... it\'s compelling as it is. It\'s really accessible as is. You want to edit it to tighten it to reflect, you know, more technicality."" But then what happens is, less people are able to access the information. And so this kind of casual way or the details where you\'re often light on details or whatever, that means that more people can actually go ""maybe I can back my hips up"" which is, in the end, all that I ask people to do.', 'KATY: Yeah. But, as my husband says, it\'s dense. I find that almost anybody would find it accessible and even to maybe even the more academic or trained person who reads it they\'d be like, ""Oh I never thought of that."" Because it\'s multi...everything that I do is multidisciplinarian in nature. Because I am just a student of everything. Not really one particular set of information. So I tend to tie in different sciences, different perspectives. And then just different, a lot of non-physical examples. I think it\'s just a great, yeah, on-ramp is a really good word because you can come in and you\'re like building speed as you go through it and by the time you\'re done you\'re like, ""ok I\'m ready. What\'s the next thing.""', 'KATY: Oh yeah. Those are free. Those are bonus.', ""KATY: And a lot of times, it's not even crappy drawings. It's bad photos through a dirty lens of a crappy drawing. So just so you know, it's gonna be a gift in a wadded, oil stained, paper bag. But isn't it the gift that counts?"", ""KATY: That's what they say. But you'd be surprised how we like doilies. We like the ribbon."", 'KATY: Oh. Well, Alignment Matters doesn\'t offer, oh gosh that\'s a good question. I think that Alignment Matters offers, it can tend to reinforce an ultimate right or wrong way to use your body. So in that way, it\'s not offering... although it is. When you go back and read it with a different point of view you will see my nods to those things. It\'s just that I feel like you have to teach alignment first and then the broader movement second. Even though as a child grows up it\'s gonna be the other way around. Like those physical position refinements come from copious amounts of movement but by the time you are already, you\'ve already adapted and are heavy and are older and have these ingrained habits, it\'s easier, I think, to identify the smaller movement habits and then work on those as your kind of eek out into a larger one. So there\'s not a ton of movement ecology. Although it is. Although it is. It\'s there. It\'s just that the focus is on the alignment part. I think it tends to, if you only read that exclusively, you\'d come away with ""I\'m supposed to have my bones in these positions all of the time"" mentality.', 'KATY: Which gets expanded upon in Move Your DNA and then Movement Matters.', 'KATY: Yeah, maybe not quite 5 years but yeah, so this next level of, you know, you write a lot and I said as much in the beginning of Movement Matters and then you get a lot of questions and then you\'re like, ""Oh that\'s a good question because I can see how I could have made a better word choice here that would be more clarifying."" And then you go, ""Ok, well maybe I didn\'t think about this one particular thing all the way through."" So I started to think at the next scale. Right? I was looking at movement through a broader perspective. And had done that over a few years. So there were all these blogs, they were fundamentally different in some ways than the ""where are your head, where are your hips, where are your knees"" blogs, which make up Alignment Matters. Although Alignment Matters, again, has a lot more but those tend to be, I think, what we see when we read Movement Matters. You could read Movement Matters and then go back and read Alignment Matters and you would see there\'s a lot of that stuff already in there. So I thought this would be kind of cool. It\'s, you know, Alignment Matters has a lot of exercises and adjustments and measures and really practical things as far as that kind of smaller version of alignment is concerned. When you go to Movement Matters or the essay or the blogs that I was writing from that point, there weren\'t a lot of exercises in them. So I originally thought I could do, there were so many of them that I felt were like this next step that we could put them into another book. Because, again, I think think that people prefer to read books more so than blogs. But it just wasn\'t - they weren\'t jelling. Because they were blurts. And I think my time for blurting got a lot less. Right? I started having kids and then was writing and working on these other books and things. I didn\'t write a blog a day. If I had written a blog every day this next level of stuff would have worked better as a compendium. But because there were too many holes, because I was thinking of everything but what was making it through to the blog was 20%.', ""KATY: So it just wasn't, everything needed to end up being expanded or rewritten or combined and so it didn't actually make it into, there wasn't a book of blog posts anymore."", ""KATY: I have definitely learned how to write better by writing and actually it was challenging. When I sat down to write Move Your DNA which is in between Alignment Matters and Movement Matters, I had only really been a blogger, an essayist, that's a different skill, as you know..."", ""KATY: ...writing books to write. So I have to teach you this one idea and expand it over the book. And I didn't, I didn't really know how to do that. Move Your DNA was tough for me. But I had transitioned into a book writer. And then I had written a few books from Move Your DNA - it got easier and easier for me to write in book form. When I had to revert back to writing essays - uh - it became challenging again because I was like, I could just go on and on and on. Your ability to edit and leave, create really powerful single sentences that replace paragraphs, that, that's challenging. So there's that transformation. Also in Movement Matter, Movement Matters required me to drill down my own knowledge on stuff a little bit more. And I know that journalists probably do this quite a bit. You're researching, if you're going to write a book about, you know, how McDonald's got started, there's quite a bit of research, right? You have to do a ton of research to gather - a lot of books are written by journalists who are telling a story of an event or a phenomenon or whatever..."", ""KATY: ... they're researching it. Movement Matters, that book- a lot of my books are things, on ideas that are not fleshed out yet. Meaning I'm not doing research in that I'm gonna go ask 12 people how they remember that the summer of 1942 or I can't go back and look at records to look at dates or whatever. I just have to sit there. I'm actually synthesizing ideas that haven't been at least documented before where you can just read them very easily. Right? I'm actually having to think like to think through the model all the way to the end. I'm doing that work first. And I would hit places in writing where it wasn't writing that was the problem it was that I couldn't, my model had not expanded to a particular point which then sent me into doing three days of research to help me synthesize an idea. Going ok, well then I need to go review all of the ecology models that are used for things totally outside of my field to see are humans listed around anywhere in here. I was doing that work so it was almost like doing academic work while I was writing."", ""KATY: It was a ton. And also as you're becoming more aware of the ideas, like Movement Matters is a big call to action book and then I'm talking about sedentarism and I'm talking about, I'm really talking about the way we use our words as far as language is concerned, nature language and how, you know, I'm sitting here inside my house looking at the tree right now and going, I'm separated, I'm talking on a podcast about being parsed from nature and I'm looking through a window at my tree and the cognitive dissonance was overwhelming during that book. I found myself needing to go well, then I have to go camping for three or four days. Like I had to actually integrate myself more and more into nature to be able to understand the complexity of the issue. Like I had to actually change my personal culture, my living culture. my lifestyle, to gather the perspective of that from the outside. Like I could kind of get a glimpse of it from the inside because I started writing it on the inside. But I was definitely transformed by that book in the same way that there was just a National Geographic Instagram post where they posted a picture of someone tree climbing, hunter gathering's populations feet. Did you see that?"", ""KATY: And so they just posted this amazing picture. And these feet...they're feet, just like your feet and my feet but they're also tools. I don't have to use my foot..."", 'KATY: Absolutely not like them at all. They are tools. and they look, while you can recognize them as the same structure, you can clearly identify that these are totally different feet than mine. But if you read through the comments of that, the comments are just about horrible, disgusting, they are from a particular culture of those look like sick...', 'KATY: Right? Because their feet are normalized to them. Their feet, that have a particular function in a state of health as a collective, you know, who have these feet in this category versus those feet over there. So for the people who have already read Whole Body Barefoot and Simple Steps to Foot Pain and Move Your DNA and natural movement are like, they didn\'t have that reaction. They were already outside of the"" here\'s what feet are supposed to look like and do and be protected culture"" because they themselves had been barefoot. You can kind of understand it in theory but until you do it then you\'re like, ""Oh I understand even more because I\'ve had to actually do that with this body part."" And so the more you get in line with the behavior that you\'re writing about, the easier it is to see just the issues that we\'re talking about. So Movement Matters, I stepped way outside. I mean I already felt like I was way outside, you know, my culture in a lot of different ways, but I\'m not. Barely. I\'m just hanging on someone\'s arm maybe leaning my ear out a little bit. But I was able to go a little bit farther and go ""Oh, ok."" But it\'s changed me permanently. I can\'t go back. I don\'t want to go back. I like this larger perspective. And these more robust set of behaviors.', 'KATY: So, I\'ve been, if you noticed, I\'ve been trying to use my word choice when I say ... I hate to constantly reinforce the idea that alignment is where your elbow and shoulders and knees and hips are. Alignment is how you move your body as a whole. So - and I use this alignment with the car understanding - you know, there\'s not, when you go get the alignment fixed with your car, the person who is adjusting your car, your wheel alignment, has to consider the context in which you\'re doing the moving. There is not a shape for your wheels that is best. There is an orientation that\'s more ... that\'s advantageous to the pressure that\'s in your tires, if you\'re gonna go off roading, on roading, the speeds, the traction, the friction. All of those things are taken into consideration. Yet it\'s a lot easier for us to continue to think about alignment as just ""are my wheels pointing to the right or the left, one to the right one to the left, because that\'s where you first get a sense of it. Right? If you were totally unaware that your body had a shape to it when it was moving. That was malleable. We start with, look down at your feet. Do they look like the tires on your car, or is one pointing out? Would you drive that car? No. You would understand that it would not be advantageous to continue to drive your car if your right wheel pointed more to the right than your left wheel. We start there. But then we go more and more. It\'s like well you know barefoot, people say ""Barefoot is best."" It\'s like, well what kind of terrain are you on? Because all those are different outcomes. How many miles do you log? What is your form as you log those miles? How much do you sit when you\'re not logging those miles? Like we\'ve continuously expanded the number of variables that we\'re considering when we\'re considering your ""alignment."" Yet it\'s easiest to just continuously go back to the ""where are my feet pointing"" as the sole parameter of what alignment is. So, if you\'re going to make the argument of something being one alignment better than another it has to refer back to something that you are comparing it to. It has to be a set, if you will, a set around - and that will probably make the most sense to math minded folks. But any time you solve a problem, you can always find an example usually that\'s a complete outlier but an example still exists for this one particular thing as false. So then you have to set a set of conditions around in which, like, you have to set the conditions in which this thing holds up.', 'KATY: So when you\'re talking about body alignment and about the benefit of one position relative to the other, it often stops, I\'ve seen, as because this is just the best one. This is good. This is bad. No referral to anything else. And then it can be a little bit more like, ""well this takes the pressure of that and this puts the pressure on that."" Okay. But is that only when we\'re standing in this one position? Because should I take this same orientation when I\'m lying on my back because then it seems those two things wouldn\'t hold up. So as you build a more complex model, you will find that the truths of the smaller models tend to go away. And so if you stay within that very narrow mindset of alignment and especially if you\'re saying here\'s how movement works and that\'s why this body part has to go here it\'s like, well, are you familiar with Nietzsche?', 'KATY: Do you know him? Like you guys have coffee.', 'KATY: So my sister in law is a philosopher and so taking about some of these things she\'s like ""Oh well that\'s what Nietzsche is basically all about."" Niche is saying and for anyone who doesn\'t know it\'s a philosopher.', ""KATY: You can Wikipedia him and quickly get up to speed on everything that's there."", 'KATY: Show notes that link to Niche.', 'KATY: Exactly. It\'s how big you choose to think about something is an indication of where you\'re willing to go with your own personal behavior. He would say I think more it allows you to do what you want to do. So if you keep asking questions. You know if you\'ve ever had kids they keep going deeper and deeper and you\'re like, ok I can\'t think anymore. There\'s a point at which your model stops expanding and that point for you relates to you. And what you can handle. Probably. Or, I don\'t know exactly what the mechanism is, but he was just basically saying you just choose to stop thinking about it beyond a particular point and that\'s just because we just all want to do what we want to do. So alignment, good alignment, has to include all of the principles of Movement Matters. Right? In terms of the frequencies and the quantities and you know, I can increase the set of alignment all the way to the planet. And that\'s what I did in Movement Matters; Is I just made a very large set where a lot of the truths around the smaller point of alignment don\'t hold up as you get into a larger and larger and larger model. I mean that\'s when ""exercise is what we need"" falls away. Like that was stripped down pretty quickly...', 'KATY: ... in Movement Matters. Like you don\'t need exercise. Exercise is... these are all sets, or conditions that are put on a sedentary culture. And to say that you don\'t need exercise, you know, that\'s like huge. It\'s a huge, but only within a culture. But then you have to clarify, but you do need movement and here are the quantities of movement or here\'s the costs of you not getting the quantities of movement and so it just kind of quickly went outside of the field of exercise science or even the biomechanics into other fields because, again, threads of science are also artificially parsed based on a system like you are only given a certain amount of years to learn something. So we\'re just gonna pull out all this other education about things that relate to your thing and you\'re just gonna get one but then you\'re back to that phone call with your mom where how was your day, it was fine. You\'ve left out quite a bit of things of your day. So our academic threads are often like that tiny tidbits and of course, the farther that you go the more you get them. But then sometimes the more you get they\'re more on a deeper level. They\'re not necessarily integrated or expanding back into other threads, so... to me, to round back to your question, 47 minutes later, that\'s why Movement Matters, the integration of, it\'s not so much that one needs the other and they need both it\'s that if you\'re going to talk about movement and the human need for movement, all of these details matter. If you\'re just saying humans need movement it sounds a lot like humans need to eat. Well, we know that. And then the nutritionist will say, ""well you don\'t only need to eat. Here\'s all these nuts and bolts within your food that you need."" So to me, the alignment community is really kind of like the nutrient-centric community. They\'ve got kind of some of the nuts and bolts but they might not understand how to design an all day all life meal plan. Where does the food come? Where\'s the grocery store? The things, they\'ve got the fact that your hands, the way that you\'re moving is leaving some of you unnourished but maybe they don\'t know how quite how to get more food if you will.', ""KATY: So, it's just that. That's what's going on. So I'm trying - my next book..."", ""KATY: ...Is hopefully the integration of both of those ideas all together. Where it's like, and I've tried to do that with Move Your DNA but I think because Movement Matters wasn't born yet, there's a lot of things about other variables that maybe were introduced in a couple sentences here or there but not really expanded. So I will do my first book to integrate Alignment Matters, Move Your DNA, and"", ""KATY: and Movement Matters all into one thing to go like here's as close to a giant ball as I can hand you. But, reading Alignment Matters first will really help. You know you can read all those books separately by their own. It's not like one replaces, one doesn't replace the other. There's just so much going on in my day..."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""KATY: But it's not only a, it's not so much an evolution or expansion of my thinking, it's just, it's more in the writing. You know, like, if I wrote this integration book of all three, again, I don't know how accessible it will be because it requires that you step quite far out of the current culture. So for me Alignment Matters and Simple Steps to Foot Pain Relief are very gentle, they're very gentle nudges to get you to consider one tiny aspect of your life that hardly matters to anyone else."", 'KATY: Where it\'s a very safe place to start going, I didn\'t know that I wasn\'t moving that. And I didn\'t know that me not moving that was preferred by everyone around me. And so I actually think that going through that process of the gentle nudges makes when you read the bigger nudges, it makes them more accessible to you. Because there\'s not a big shudder in the earth. And then again, just like some people like things packaged with bows, some people like things packed with punch and they can\'t hear the gentle. Right? They can only hear the punches so that\'s where there\'s so many keys. But I am trying to just, for people who are asking ""Where do I start?"" Well, Alignment Matters is still a great way to kind of just gently get yourself moving.', 'KATY: I can think of a couple things. So head ramping.', 'KATY: It\'s a big move in Alignment Matters. You\'ll see it actually a few times, I think. And so if you\'re on your phone right now or if you\'re on your computer or maybe a lot of people are out walking because they\'re listening to the podcast, but your head tends to go way out in front of your body. And head ramping is one of our corrective exercises, it\'s an alignment adjustment where you\'re gonna slide your, you\'re gonna slide your chin back and it goes back and it also comes up in heights just a little bit and the top of your head nods forward a little bit and so your neck gets longer behind you and your eyes lift away from the horizon just a little bit. And so it changes the curve that are in the arteries in that section. It changes the curve of your spine both upper thoracic and the cervical spine. In Dynamic Aging, I talk about swallowing, you know, that it\'s changing the orientation of your swallowing tubes, right? When you induce a curve in them when you have your head way out in front of you versus way back. And it\'s funny, in Alignment Matters, I talk about that in Dynamic Aging and I have this really technical drawing of here\'s the process of food through your mouth or through your throat. In Alignment Matters, I took a picture of a bendy straw next to a non-bendy straw. Like that was my diagram to say ""look, your straw can go up and down or it can bend and curve and which one changes the forces required for things to move through it."" Like that\'s where I was. And I still love those diagrams. I still do that all the time for my kids. I still do that all the time when I\'m speaking live. It\'s just grab the nearest thing that makes me think about this, because you can get like, ""Oh I get that having to go around a curve would be harder."" But it\'s so much easier to see it in some sort of physical example. But anyway, so that\'s an Alignment Matters thing. It\'s a particular adjustment. But in Movement Matters we\'re talking about swallowing and chewing and the need to really masticate. And also the idea that mastication is not just to exercise your jaw but it\'s, you know, driving blood flow up into your brain and that, or if it\'s breastfeeding as a child, that you\'re working on developing these structures, the future structures of your throat and your palate. And so there\'s not particular, like in one hand, chewing and you know selecting less mechanically processed foods would be kind of the exercise that you would take away, just a behavior. You\'re gonna eat anyway so it\'s just swapping, you know beef jerky or dehydrated mango for whatever else you were eating that didn\'t require very much manual processing. And that\'s going to change or affect the alignment, the use, of that area of your body. Also, head ramping can do that too, but in a completely different way. And then if you marry both of them you\'ll find that maybe if you\'re chewing beef jerky and if you only got the chew message from the larger activity but you\'re not pairing it with the head ramping activity then you might find swallowing more difficult than if you did pair it together. So the correctives are different. The movements that you\'re trying to incorporate in your life are different. Chewing is just a behavior that you\'re gonna do anyway that you\'re modifying how you\'re doing it. Head ramping is a distinct corrective exercise that you\'re doing. But they really do well together. When you start pairing the larger behavior changes with these slight physical adjustments, the adaptations are different as well as the actual experience of either one. You know ramping your head while you\'re swallowing is different than just ramping your head while you\'re not.', ""KATY: Right? You're actually putting a physiological process through that new shape. So anyway that's kind of one. And the other one is just for our certification. Our graduates came, and you know we do a lot of different classes while they're here."", ""KATY: A lot of different classes on squatting and hip opening and where they're practicing these very subtle ranges of motion. Shifting from one to the other to make sure that their body, like, it's one thing to be able to sit in a V-sit and then stand up and then get down and then squat and then get up and then cross-legged. How well you shift between them without really having to over displace your body, that's the next level of skill. I decided that they had done so much technical alignment exercise inside on rubber floors on rubber mats, you know, in artificial light with all facing the same direction and not really interacting. Right?"", ""KATY: Like this very laboratory style approach to movement. To me, it's not very different than if you look if you've ever worked in research labs where animals are kind of parsed into their own space. It's very much like that. You came here to work on this by yourself. Yes, you're in a collective, but it's all about you and what you're doing. And so there's a particular vibe and it's necessary like if you're gathering data about yourself you need to be able to observe yourself. And that's why we stand on our own mat in our own space and no one's foot is allowed to come on your yoga mat because that would be totally awkward. This is yours."", 'KATY: I decided to...but that\'s our normal exercise experience. Like that is our, that is how we see movement. I decided to take them out. And to do two hours of weeding on a farm in a Movement Matters style which was you guys were just gonna sit and play with moving your hips and your knees and doing these things for 90 minutes you were gonna do that. What if we did that and you also were barefoot in the dirt if you wanted to be. You were in the sunshine. You were weeding, meaning actually loading many more parts to that squat. You are putting it a little bit more in situ. It was in-vitro [EDIT: Friends, this is KB: I just listened to the show and heard myself say ""in vivo"" when I meant ""in vitro"" so I\'m editing it here in the notes!] before and now you\'re in-situ. Now your body is in a situation where that in-vitro, how does it hold up in a situ. Oh, do you have an easier time in dirt? Like most people will find that they\'re able to squat on natural terrain much more easily than they can when they\'re in the lab.', ""KATY: And I think that both are really necessary. Because we there's some, we're not hyper observers and what alignment, those correctives, that time, which I love still is about, it's about getting a little Dian Fossey on yourself. And it can be challenging for some people. Some people come to do the class and they don't want to observe and it's like this is a class in observation. You observing yourself moving. It's not just a movement class. It's a class in observation. That's the skill that we're trying to teach you here. So it was fun. And it was more, it ended up being I would say more satisfying, kind of like if someone gave you a hand full of a few ingredients just kind of on a plate..."", ""KATY: ...versus them blending them all together and adding some oils and other amazing things, like. So one was this really beautiful meal and the other one was a perhaps equally, it wasn't equally nutritious because there are other inputs that were happening out there that weren't happening in there but also adequately nutritious meal but the experience between eating them was different. And the land that we were on, the receivers of all of that work, those people were influenced by our squat class. Where before they would have been untouched by our squat class. Our, we actually converted squats and lunges and all the movements that we were gonna do in class, we converted them into work for a community. For other people. So it was not only more nutritious for us, it was more nutritious for others not in our movement class. And every single person who comes to that farm will benefit from that bout of labor. So you end up influencing other people more through the mode of exercise that you choose to take. So that's how we went "", ' to ', ' in a day.', ""KATY: Yeah, well I mean I think they're all meaningful because I think that they're, it is not my intention to devalue that laboratory. Like if you had a, if you have food, I'm trying to think of a good example. Like if you make fresh applesauce, versus you've got you know some kind of older processed that's maybe stabilized with other things applesauce. They are both applesauce on a certain level. And they can both nourish you. They just don't nourish you equally. And I think that for so many people to go to eating applesauce would be huge versus eating whatever less nutritious thing. Like to make that, like I'm gonna start eating, you know, my healthy applesauce every day. That's a huge positive conversion. It's just that if you only go the Motts and you're looking at the Motts and you're thinking that this is your sole portal, there are other, there's even more to be gathered from non-Mott's applesauce. Right? And someone can give you a bowl of that fresh one. That would be great right? That would be..."", ""KATY: ...arguably more nutritious. Then you go to the next step of making it yourself. Where you got only the end goal but you got the movement of actually making it. So it's a continuum. They're all meaningful to you but if you're gonna talk about a science of something you don't necessarily want the scientists of that doing as Nietzsche said and stop thinking about it when it's uncomfortable for them. Although it's hard because we're humans and we do that. But you want your models to continuously be developed and understood more robustly. That it makes people uncomfortable is a fact. But it doesn't really influence that that is the trajectory of how you gather, you know, the information. So that's just what I'm doing. I don't really have any judgment on how you want to do it. But for me teaching movement I thought, how great to teach an expanded version. Right? Like if I'm facilitating movement experiences, let me facilitate this other one over here and now you've had the experience in the context of a class."", 'KATY: Cool.', 'KATY: Expanded.

All bodies are welcome here. Are you ready to get moving?', '\n', '\n', 'Music', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: You have probably heard me talk before about something called “re-wilding.” \xa0It came up in my conversation a few episodes back, I think, when we were talking about long distance walking. \xa0In general, to re-wild means to restore an area of land back to its uncultivated state, but in the way, it’s commonly used in natural movement or discussions surrounding diet - paleo diet, natural diet, ancestral health, - a person is attempting to restore themselves in this same way. So someone could eat a more wild diet, or move in nature in natural ways, decrease their screen time, reduce artificial light distribution or sources. There's many different ways to “re-wild” oneself. \xa0In either human or land re-wilding, the opening argument is that our body/the earth’s body works in its wild state but not as well in a cultivated one. We re-wild land so that it is able to serve all the functions it once did, and similarly, we re-wild ourselves to restore functions that our body has lost due to being cultivated for a particular civilization. We remove behaviors that are required for certain aspects of civilization as well as add some behaviors that have also been removed, and we get a different physiological experience. So, \xa0I take off my shoes to move my feet - to give my feet (and my knees and my hips and my spine) the movement that they need, so I'm restoring this natural or wild practice. Or I'm getting rid of shoes - I'm getting rid of the practice, the non-wild practice, so it just depends on how you look at it. But once I do that I don’t fit as well into society. I get rid of the furniture standard to this current society to move more and also fit in less. And the same thing goes for a dozen other things I do. So to re-wild is, in this case, requires I behave untypically, but for the same ecological reasons, a biologist would advocate for restoring wetlands or preserving a forest. The earth works in a certain way, and humans too have always worked a certain way with the earth, and the way we’re behaving now is not really working well for us or the earth. And I’ll also just say it, re-wilding the land is very much tied to re-wilding our own bodies. Each informs the other, and each goes stepwise, lockstep."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""In 1854, Henry David Thoreau did his own version of re-wilding. “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived,” he famously wrote in his book Walden. “I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.” (end quote) Interestingly enough, sucking bone marrow - not the metaphor - is likely part of some of you listeners’ re-wilding practice. Note Thoreau also built a little cabin and planted a garden, and lived simply on Walden Pond for a little over two years. I also heard that his mom was close by and did all of his laundry the whole time. Just a fun side - just a fun fact. He eventually moved back to the city, but he understood and wrote about the value he found in self-reliance and solitude. So, I’m hoping to actually go the other way, to write about it as I have already done, and then go live it. So that's my plan just in case anyone's listening. If Thoreau were still alive, I would try to get him as a guest on this podcast. But in his absence, I’m gonna talk with Arthur Haines, super cool Arthur Haines; a primitive skills mentor who will be here with three tips to help you reclaim ancestral ways of living - help you re-wild a bit, wherever you are."", '\n', 'So I picked this question because I thought it lent itself nicely to this conversation of re-wilding. ', ""So I notoriously do not follow protocols. Like I'm not really a system user or a protocol follower although I do appreciate large principles and ideas and then I kind of find my own - the way that it works for me - the practice that allows me to adapt it to my body, my situation. So cold plunging is not something that I do in the same way that I would make sure I'm eating vegetables every day. I'm not sure that I cold plunge every day. For me, and of course, I'm fortunate enough to be around natural bodies of water quite regularly, so I'm kind of reminded by, if I'm out by the river, I should probably go in it. If it's convenient enough. So if I'm camping near of body of water, days of celebration, especially if they're celestially based or nature-based to me, kind of call out to have some sort of element of something startling which is going in a cold body of water. How's it going? I would say in the last two weeks I've gone into two different rivers and this is early to mid-November. \xa0Freezing rivers. But I did it with other people. I've done it for bathing while camping. So again, that would be my practice. My practice is to do it in a way that most makes sense. Now that all being said, I do like to sauna and if I sauna I will add that cold water element because that is, for me that's another movement feat I enjoy which is to go hot and cold, hot and cold. I think of it as exercise for the cells of my body that aren't moved as regularly. So that's it. And that would be - I would say a lot of people would put being able to tolerate. And Arthur and I will get into this later on. I've got this in the questions. This idea of being more tolerant or resilient to more scenarios opens up the experiences that are available to you. So I was having this discussion the second to the last time I was in a cold river with friend and colleague Kristen Marvin. I will "", "" in the show notes because she was, while I was getting in and out of the water, she was kind of lingering around and swimming kind of like a sea lion for 20 minutes comfortably in this really cold water. But we were talking about one of the reasons that we're doing it is not for the health benefits. The health benefits are definitely a byproduct. But more because it opens up so many more experiences when you can tolerate or when your body can cope with and deal with the extreme and recover. Right? That's the same reason people do cardiovascular exercise. They're plunging into something that challenges them for a short period of time. But cardiovascular fitness is really more the ability to recover after doing it. Everyone can be startled and have their heart rate thrown up or have to do something strenuous. The resiliency of the heart and the lungs and really the entire body in that environment of intensity is that you can recover after it. \xa0And so for us, the reason that I go into cold water is yes, for the fact that this is a bit of landscape on the planet that I was able to interact with because of the work that I've done with my body. So I get that experience. But it also means that I don't have to, if I perceive that something's going to be cold or wet like the weather, it does not automatically mean that I have to stay inside my box. Or stay inside a particular set of clothing. That I don't have to have so much stuff for my physical body to be on the earth comfortably. So that is really my perspective. And that's the same reason, really, that I'm moving in the way I'm moving and going into nature is that I believe first and foremost that I'm a person of the planet. And I want to make sure that the planet and I are in a harmonious relationship. So how is the cold plunge going for you? That's my question for all of you out there.

I'm not sure how great it would be to listen to a recording of it, but I have a lot of ideas, and I would say that there's not a tremendous number of people that I could bounce ideas off of with certain areas of my work. But again, some time I hope that sometime we have extended time to work through some of these more biologist questions that I have. But we'll have to keep this to a respectful 30 to 40 minutes. How did you first get interested in foraging and other primitive skills?"", '\n', ""ARTHUR: Oh, good question. It's something that, where I grew up, was an activity that a lot of people participated in. Partly out of tradition in some cases. I mean there were a lot of people where I lived that wouldn't be described as wealthy or even middle class who foraged for various things during the year just as a result of a financial need to secure inexpensive food. Of course as I grew older and started to do research on the nutrition that was found in rare plants, I started to realize that this wasn't just a way that we could potentially save money, but it was a way that we could really bolster the amount of all these nutritional elements that we don't necessarily get in a deep way from our cultivated diets. And so there's been a lot of different avenues that I've become reinterested over and over again in foraging."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: So it was originally dietary nutrition that piqued your interest, but I think people who are familiar with this concept of re-wilding recognize now it's so much more than food. So when did you start to think, I guess beyond the diet."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: More recently. I mean later in my life, Katy, I started thinking of foraging as being more than just what we put in our body but also starting to be a really important part of our life way here because foraging for wild plants is a way of securing food that leaves the forest standing. It may be one of the most sustainable ways to secure food in human history. And understanding that not everyone based on their location and their knowledge base and other factors can participate in foraging but those who can should.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: What have you observed that convinces you that these skills or honing these skills over time is a good investment?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: \xa0Well, I mean the most obvious one is health. And we could talk about human health. We could talk about ecosystem health. I mean there are people that I have met, and this also would include myself in many ways, where there were significant health issues, chronic health issues that had been experienced in some cases for years. There's a person who is close to me who is having tremendous gut dysbiosis for example and was experiencing diarrhea essentially every single time this person went to the bathroom for years. And after spending some time committing to learning about wild plants in addition to some various tests and things to find out food sensitivities, this is a person who now is experiencing very regular bowel movements without those watery stools and has been able to upgrade their health, they're overall physical fitness, pretty tremendously from wild foods. And we could use a number of examples of people that I've worked with regarding wild nutrition."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: Yeah. I'm currently reading Jeff Leach who started a lot of the research on the microbiome "", ', and that\'s kind of a theme there as well. I think that when people hear ""diet of wild foods"" they\'re thinking, of course, of maybe the nutritional profile of those foods, but nature is so complex. There\'s so many variables and another variable added is not only the nutrients of these foods but the microbiome that comes from diversifying greatly. I think he recommends 30 different food types every day just to get your gut basically what it needs. So I\'ve just been interested in expanding the idea of food being something that gives you more than just dietary nutrition. And one of the ways that I\'ve expanded upon that is by talking about the movement that food can give you. I\'ve talked a lot about it on this show, and it\'s in the books that I write. Which is, we have a long-term relationship with food, but we have an equally long-term relationship with the movements to get that food and so I kind of introduce the idea of mechanical nutrients. And so the natural movement paradigm that I like to write about really involves food and wild food and also kind of the middle step which is cultivating your own food in your own space which has an element of gardening which I think has some human history behind it as well to various extent. \xa0So I want to talk a little bit about easy tips. ', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: Well yeah. The wall of grief is that thing that humans come up against when they really start looking into the changes, and often these are drastic changes, and they are not for the good changes that have happened with modern living. We know that we're experiencing unprecedented rights of chronic disease, that we have huge amounts of depression that was not seen in intact hunter-gatherer cultures. We know that we're polluting our ecosystems and that it's now hard to find food that is clean. Recent research was showing when they were looking at breakfast foods, that nearly all of the samples, various cereals and other kinds of breakfast foods, are all contaminated with glyphosate, one of the ingredients in round up. \xa0The ecocide that is occurring. We're entering the world's sixth major extinction. And we could keep going especially if we started talking about the lack of community and the feelings of isolation that many people have. And when all of this starts to be known, and we look into these things, this is a pretty heavy feeling. It's a pretty serious thing. And I find many people run into the wall of grief where they have a lot of despair. They don't know which direction to turn, and it can be paralyzing because it feels like, in some ways, almost every aspect of modern living has been touched in some negative way by this industry that we rely on."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: So, when I read that, I guess it made me happy that I\'ve been trying to do this series. I\'ve been doing a podcast for a long time, and sometimes the theory gets so heavy that I feel like when people hear all of the work to be done, it almost keeps us from doing anything. This wall of grief. I\'ve never heard it put that way. It\'s always framed as, ""don\'t be so lazy"" or ""come on step up."" But it really is this grief. It\'s an emotional weight that the inertia of it is so great that to take a step seems impossible. So I wanted to offer this short series of simple action tips that could help people move beyond what I\'m now going to call a wall of grief, using your term. Just so they can feel like something is possible. Something is possible pretty immediately in some way. We\'re gonna give six tips. And we\'re gonna do that right now. I asked you to bring three tips for taking any general action on recultivating an ancestral way. ', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: \xa0Well for me it's figure out a way to incorporate more phytochemistry in your diet."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: What's phytochemistry for the listeners at home?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: Well funny you should ask. Phytochemistry is a fancy term that's talking about plant compounds or these chemicals that are found in plants. And these have some pretty manifest interactions with our health. And I'm generally speaking about very positive ones. And what's really important that people understand is that the cultivated produce that we rely on has been shown through a large body of research at this point to contain fewer and sometimes less diverse kinds of these beneficial phytochemicals that used to be very abundant in our diet. Some examples: Wild blueberries contain up to 3 fold the level of antioxidants (and these come from anthocyanins that are a class of pigments that are found in plants), so wild blueberries contain up to 3 fold the antioxidant capacity of cultivated blueberries. Now, remember these antioxidants are very important for us. They fulfill a lot of roles including quenching oxidative damage and being sort of part of an overall strategy to fight various things like inflammation and potentially even protect us against cancer. Similar studies have been done with blackberries showing up to 80% more beneficial phytochemistry, and I'm talking again specifically about these antioxidant compounds in wild versus cultivated species. Wild strawberries, another one. Many many times the level of antioxidants. I think maybe one of the best examples the I enjoy using in my lectures is just the fact that when we go to the store to purchase grapes, almost all of the grapes that we purchase and that are even available to us in the marketplace are seedless. But of course, grape seed extract which would be something available to us with seeded grapes which is what the wild species are is something that also has a host of research demonstrating that it's really beneficial to humans. We know that it accelerates the healing of soft tissues. It has benefits for oral health. It can even protect against ultraviolet radiation which helps us with getting conscientious sun exposure without the harm, boost blood vessel health. There's, again, cancer prevention and treatment. It's an antiviral. And we could go on with all of the research that backs up grape seed extract, but of course, we have bred the seeds out of modern grapes, and so we just completely miss out on this unless we go to the health food store to buy the grape seed extract. And it seems kind of strange - we breed the medicine out, and then we go buy it. So wild plants offer us this really easy way to upgrade our intake of beneficial phytochemicals."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: Because we're a science-based culture, we tend to parse for understanding, and I feel like we also parse, like literally parse our food apart. So we've taken the seeds out. So I wonder, what was the original complaint of seeds? \xa0That people don't like the way that they feel in their mouth, which is that texture element? We've bred out if we can use bred out of our walking paths as well. Any texture beneath our feet. We're so averse to any sort of - you know texture is really just a different tongue orientation. It is just a shape. I have little kids and so naturally putting everything in their mouth and working with different speech pathologists who are like, yeah, they're getting the motor skills to deal with that texture, that shape, to be able to expel it as necessary. They're strengthening all those parts. So we got rid of the feeling that we don't like, but then we still have, somewhere along the line, identified it as medicine so then somewhere, someone is pulling out all these grape seeds and pressing them to get the medicinal oil which is also free from its seed. Right? It's in a bottle now and requires all this extra energy. So that phenomenon of why we do that. Why are we averse to the intact thing? Is it just the movement required for it - whether it be whole body or of the tongue?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: \xa0There's a number of factors that play in with different species of seeds. But it is interesting that we want this more homogenous experience as we bite into the flesh of the fruit, be it a grape or a banana for example."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Yeah. Is it bitterness? \xa0Definitely, in this culture we are not comfortable I would say, with bitter. ', ""So this is this idea of returning to ancestral practices for personal health, but I would say also for family/community/ecosystem health. For me, I did not come up in an ecological model of understanding - even my own work in movement. But the more you learn your own trade or your craft, the more ecologically geared questions you have to start asking and then eventually arrive back to well the most complex model is the model we're after. And so I find that re-wilding has a lot of just this idea that we're after the complexity now. We're not complexity averse any longer. \xa0So with food, so much of the food that we eat, the movement has been taken out of it. People listen to this show through a movement filter. They're trying to figure out how to add more movement into their life. And the mindset is get more exercise. But I'm really interested in the nutrients of movement: what are their types and then what are their volume or distribution throughout a year - throughout a season, or a year, or a season of life. And so I would recommend that people start trying to restore food preparation motion. So that would be - it could be gathering your own food. But it could also be grinding your own food or chopping your own food. Look at the foods that you buy. Is it a giant plastic bag filled with already peeled carrots or can you get closer to the whole and then do the preparation work that you prefer yourself? Can you grind your own coffee beans? Or mash your own coffee beans, if that's what you're eating? \xa0So figure out the foods that you eat and see how you can move a little bit more for them. And it's not only for the motions. But it is, it's about connecting to your food. It's about - maybe connecting at first to the movement that you're outsourcing for the convenience of your food. And it increases appreciation. It prolongs maybe the interaction that you have with your food. You're smelling it. You're seeing how it comes from the earth - what shape. No carrots come out looking like the baby carrots that people are massively consuming."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: Why are we averse to the lumps and the bumps and the texture of a carrot? At what point did smooth, infant looking carrots become the ones that we gravitate towards? \xa0So that's my start ancestral health practices. And it can be done in the convenience of your own kitchen. It usually just requires that you make different choices when you're sourcing or purchasing your food. \xa0"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: \xa0Well for me, conscientious sun exposure is a really huge one which means getting outdoors. And despite the fact that a recent New York Times article was kind of signaling that maybe the Vitamin D craze - one of the things that is produced when UVB rays shine on our skin, particularly in conjunction with the sebum, the oil on our skin - suggesting that maybe we\'ve gone a little overboard and we don\'t \xa0need as high a levels as we believe. The fact is when sun lands on our skin, there\'s a whole cascade of beneficial reactions that take place. I mean there\'s just too many for us to discuss. It isn\'t simply that we create ultimately this form of Vitamin D that our bodies can use. It creates a host of other things. For example, melanocyte stimulating hormone which is known to reduce appetite. It obviously boosts skin pigmentation when the sunlight or these rays are creating more of this particular hormone. But it also even increases libido, and we could go into other things that that does. One of the really interesting things for me is that people often don\'t realize that in order to get a really good night\'s sleep we know that we need darkness. And we need lights that are poor in the blue wavelength so that we\'re not stimulated into alertness. But on the flip side, to help with our circadian rhythms and to generate alertness at the right times of day, we need to be out in the bright sun, out in the bright part of the day to let our body know, ""Oh, this is day. This is when I\'m awake. And this is when I need to be alert and completely focused on my task so that my body then knows when to essentially shut down for sleep."" And many people don\'t realize the interior of our homes, even if there are many windows, are simply nowhere near as bright as the outdoors. And so getting outside to simply experience as bright a day as possible and to, again, help set those circadian rhythms so that they know when to go to sleep is really important. My sleep is definitely compromised if I have those days where I\'m unable to get outdoors to let my body know, ""Ah ha. This is when I\'m supposed to be alert."" But I just hope that people realize that there\'s a whole suite of things: a beta-endorphin, we have substance P, and all of these compounds that are up-regulated when light shines on our skin that do these really wonderful things for us - it\'s not just about the Vitamin D production when we get outdoors and let light shine on our skin.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: And don't windows block most UVB anyway?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: They do. It's the UVA which is able to make it through. But UVB which is one of the more beneficial wavelengths, while UVA does have some benefit - for example, it can upregulate nitrous oxide from storage - the release of it so that we dilate our blood vessels and it reduces blood pressure, but we miss out on this large suite of advantages that UVB provides us."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: I just think that it's so helpful to clarify because when you don't understand sometimes the nuts and bolts of things like interaction between things, it's not only that you see the brightness of the day. That's one element of sunlight. In that case, a window works. But when we're talking about interaction you have to look at all the barriers - I call it we just have massive exoskeletons we've built up all around us trying to select the things that we perceive as less harmful in. So we put in windows, but you've actually blocked some nutrition that way. Your windows, while they're letting in light are lacking certain nutritional elements. But I like the idea of adding the word conscientious in there. So why do we need to add the word conscientious when we're talking about sun exposure - for the people who run with the idea that more sun is better."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: \xa0Right. Yeah. More is not necessarily better because we do want to be careful not to overdo it. One of the things that for me that I always try to get across is your sun exposure in some ways has to be correlated with your diet. Do you have the dietary elements? \xa0Those antioxidants, those compounds that protect us from the sun, in your diet? Otherwise, you\'re doing potential harm to your skin and while what we call a quote ""sunburn"" often isn\'t a sunburn. It\'s our skin\'s normal response to dissipating the energy that\'s absorbed. We can actually go too far and blister our skin and damage it which can potentially set us up later in life for skin cancer. And so it is important that we consider sun exposure as something that we get but only in the amounts that our skin is capable of getting which is partly based on the phytochemistry we\'re bringing in our diet.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""So natural movement practice is something that I recommend. But that's very large. Right? So to keep from hitting that wall and to keep things easy, ground sitting or floor sitting. I find that to be the foundation to larger movement feats. And floor sitting is also great. So floor sitting is inside. Ground sitting is outside. The pressures are a little bit different but in the end getting up and down are the same thing mobilizing various parts and maintaining certain strengths to be able to do that is part of the movement nourishment to be found in an ancestral health practice. If you can make a priority to sit on the ground outside, then you would be getting both my and Arthur's tips, right? You would have some sun exposure. You can also have some ground sitting using it as nature observation or if you add food processing while you're sitting there. So once you start doing things like, if you take my earlier tip - preparing more food by hand - you'll find that it takes more time, but it adds more movement, so, therefore, you're getting food and movement at the same time so it ends up saving time later on. But if you're sitting outside in the sunshine processing your food - especially if you've processed more nutrient dense food or some wild food element, you'll be doing all four tips so far at once. So I'm a big fan of not hearing what Arthur and I are saying as increasing your to-do list by four, but ultimately nature should - all the things that you need from nature - the bulk of them should be able to be happening at the same time. So that is what complex systems do is all of the things at once. So we are advocating, I would say, a more nutrient dense moment in time. That's how I think about it. I think of stacking functions from a permaculture is you're increasing the nutritional density of a period of time in your life."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: Yeah. I think that's really really good, Katy, to help people realize they don't just need to have a longer day to accomplish all these things. You wrote about that in several different places in at least the latest book of yours that I had read. And as I recall you might have referred to it as stacking and I just really thought that was a great idea to pull in all these different things. And I do hope that while this is all going on, and you're kind of alluding to it, that your listeners are thinking of nutrition not just as what you put in your mouth. You know it isn't just what we get from the animal, plant, fungal, and bacterial kingdoms but it's also the elements that we need to be exposed to and also the experiences that we need to have which includes a wide array of things. But movement and movement diversity is one of those things. So I sort of look at it as having these six food groups rather than just four that is often discussed."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Yeah. And then we can add, I find community to be another primary nutrient. So it\'s so interesting when you are talking nutrients, volume to me really dictates importance. I mean there are nutrients that are trace, and there are nutrients that occur to greater volume. So I think we\'ve kind of classified our nutrients by volume. However, we tend to, I think, as a culture, see volume or I would say we probably see magnitude as greater importance than trace. But that\'s why I like to bring in this idea of volume because if you have something that\'s occurring in volume like community in an ancestral setting - especially in intact communities - I strive for adding what I call vitamin community to my food and my movement. That\'s a really big part of my personal re-wilding practice is to go, ""What does the group of people that I\'m with look like right now."" \xa0When I\'m making food. When I\'m moving. Are these solo activities? Are these involving a greater diversity of people: age groups, skill levels. Because I\'m always trying to, again, increase that nutritional density of a moment. So things like food processing - when I had young children and I\'m writing books and I\'ve got all this work that I\'m doing and I\'m striving for more community, it was really surprising to find that I could go to my personal elders - my grandparents - and then recall that they had always sat around and cracked nuts as a group and contributed to the volume of movement for a community. They couldn\'t go out and jog with me for five miles. But that was one very low magnitude movement compared to all the other movements that I needed to be able to eat for the day - just found that I could include so many more people. And then the stories and the interactions between - oh, and then now the young children can also move alongside me. And I just really I am a big fan of that diversity in community and bringing that in. That\'s just a bonus tip for everybody. Because that wasn\'t a planned tip.', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: I just think that community is a big thing for me. Texture or diversity of movement, diversity of the dietary nutrients, and community. These are all main axis as I'm figuring out how to spend my day, you know? Which is really just figuring out how to spend my life. "", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: My third tip is to find every way possible to remove polymers, in other words plastics, from your life. I think that it is not exaggerating to say that this is almost like we've entered this new materials age. Where we had the copper age, the bronze age, the iron age, and now we've moved into the plastic age. And unfortunately, while we went kind of headlong into this dependence on this diverse array of materials, we never really stopped to find out and do the thorough testing to identify how safe these compounds were. We assumed that they were inert. That things that we put in containers made out of them would come out exactly the same. And we've learned that that's not the case. That things leach into the liquids in particular the fatty liquids and those things cause us harm. We could talk about a wide array of these things like bisphenol a, one of the compounds that is still widely used and in fact even those things that were often touted as being BPA free, this particular compound that's added to plastics - really the industry does not ever say BPA free what they say is BPA not intentionally added because it often contaminates the other plastics they use through the dust and this kind of thing in the factories. And remember that babies who are born to mothers with a higher exposure of BPA show lower birth weights and smaller heads. In other words, they have smaller brains. Fetal growth metrics are reduced and these kinds of things. Unfortunately, it isn't just BPA, but we have a host of things that are found in polymers but also even showing up in really weird places like cosmetics and things of that nature like phthalates. \xa0Phthalates is another chemical that is used to help make polymers flexible. And these also leach into the liquids and the fatty things that we put in contact with them. And what's really I guess important to remember is that these are endocrine disrupters. They mimic estrogen in some cases, and the last thing you want to do is mess around with your hormone system. These are compounds that work in tiny trace amounts at just the right time. And we know that fowling with our endocrine system is a really effective way, if you will, to help increase the incidents of cancer. But we also see studies showing that when we are exposed to abundant phthalates, we also have various issues coming up which include recent studies showing that higher phthalate concentrations in moms, we have greater degree of social cognition, communication, and awareness issues in the children they give birth to. These are real. While the industry likes to describe them as safe, nearly every independent study demonstrates that they can cause harm to them. And of course, we know where they're ending up. They're ending up in our oceans and in our groundwater."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Yeah. And I live in an area kind of heavy with Orcas and Salmon, and it\'s an issue here for sure - what\'s in the water. \xa0We made a pledge to give up plastic in our food. And again, that wall. If you could just pick one thing at first. So plastic in your food could be one thing. But if you need a smaller step. I mean the number of disposable cups with plastic lids that I see people just grabbing once or twice a day. It\'s so much. \xa0A really good tip is to just start carrying a jar with you wherever you go. And I just did - my tip\'s gonna be long distance walking because I find long distance walking to be a really great ancestral practice for not only the movement but also for a few other things that I\'ll talk about. So I just did a big one in the city because I do them kind of the more rural wild place where I live. But because I recommend it so often and because so many people live in urban settings, they\'re like, ""You need to do your 20 mile walk in an urban setting to give us that perspective on this recommendation"" and I brought a glass cup with me like I always do. I went to a different country for a couple months, and our entire family brought, because when you\'re on the road quite a bit it\'s very easy to use plastic because you\'re not prepared to not use plastic.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: That's the big thing. If you want to stop using plastic you have to be prepared not to use it. If we're going to talk about food that's a napkin, silverware or utensils is a better way to say it, and a glass or a cup. If you can have these items at your ready. They go into your purse. They go into your backpack. You wash them regularly. We were able to go two months not being at home, traveling abroad, and used zero disposable plastic items."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: That's awesome."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: A family of four. But it took a lot of preparation. And also, it took times telling us no - telling ourselves \' In the same way like for parents you are used to, I would say you are trying to guide your offspring on learning the art of dealing with consequence, but I don\'t think we\'re that practiced at dealing with consequences. We have kind of an ""I want it so I deserve it, so I\'m going to get it."" But I found myself really wanting that quick thing to get and really feeling like I needed it but I didn\'t bring my cup or whatever, then I don\'t get it. I don\'t allow myself to get it. Because I have to have external, kind of subjective guidelines or else I\'ll always convince myself that what I need is what I need. \xa0So I have that as a thing, ""Am I going to have to use plastic to get it?"" No. Giving up straws. It\'s just another kind of crazy thing that we do. Put plastic straws in all of our drinks. And I have a six and seven year old now and really just having to have this regular reminder of why we don\'t do straws and taking them out in the world to see what some of the consequences are to all these things in an age-appropriate manner where they themselves are going, ""Yeah, I don\'t want a straw."" They can get that. It\'s a family project. It\'s a community project. So definitely work on eliminating plastic.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: We do the same here. We have tried to create in some cases very creative ways of even bringing story into why we don't like plastic in our lives aside from the health issues. \xa0And different stories can work in different families. Here because there is an animistic spirituality if you will that we're breaking into and I don't mean to go too far here but we, knowing that plastics are coming from oil, and these oil deposits are coming from these long-extinct forests, we're literally describing these plastics as being made of the spirits of long extinct life. And these life forms wanted to remain in the ground, and they come back to haunt us if you will when we disrupt them. And that's just a way that we have created a story around why we avoid these plastics because my daughter was, you know, is young. She's only just turned 5. And to sit down and give her all of the scientific research is simply too much. It doesn't mean anything to her, so we've had to create story for now around why we avoid plastic. And we, it's like you said, it becomes a family and a community level act that we all participate into the degree possible. Instead of storing in plastic bags we use glass storage containers including even just mason jars and things like that. There's a thousand ways to avoid this much of which is based on convenience that we've gotten used to. People don't like to have to carry things. They just want to get a throwaway version wherever they happen to be eating or getting a drink and so on.

Again, I'm very interested in - I'm interested in movement, clearly. But I'm interested in our tendency towards convenience. In not framing it not as a human deficit but humans really behaving entirely appropriately given the environment that we've created. \xa0It is much easier to invite community over and use disposable. Why? Because it saves time in terms of prepping and washing and so I do it because community is one of our big three axes of how we're setting up our day. We have a lot of communal eating, and we don't use disposable stuff. And we also feel perfectly ok setting up wash tubs so that everyone can wash up their stuff when they're done. Or sometimes we have so many people over, and we don't have enough stuff for everyone, so we're kind of washing as we're changing courses or over a period of time we're washing up our own stuff. But I'm just really interested in, is all of this convenience, like even down to things like plastic, is at the root of it our tendency towards sedentarism? \xa0Which is just simply perfectly natural behavior given this habitat. Could we expect anyone to behave any differently in this habitat? Which is why when we are collectively as a group of people making decisions about habitat, and that can be government structures, schools, communities, whatever level you want to look at it. What I'm always saying is if we're going to add something, if we're bringing a new technology or new materials to this piece how is that going to affect the behavior of the humans in that space? Is plastic just another symptom of lack of movement? I try to normalize everything to movement - it's my bias. Admittedly."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: Right. But in a way, I agree very much with you. That comfort and convenience that comes with all of this research that we've put into the TV remote, for example, so it can operate multiple electronics at the same time. We're just creating more comfort and convenience that allows us to be more sedentary, more still, do less movement, less kinds of movement, less total movement. Plastic definitely fits into this comfort and convenience sphere that I think is really contributing to a lot of the dis-ease that we have today."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'And the long-distance walking, you know I am always trying to stack as many things on to anything that I do. Again, is this the most nutrient dense moment that I can realistically create. And so for me, that long distance walking is - yes it is an opportunity to get myself into the nutrients of a long distance walk. There\'s ways of using your body for walking that you never tune into. There are movements that you never get otherwise. Because walking - we think of it as one particular pattern. \xa0The longer you walk over a distance you have to start letting certain things rest and start calling on other movement pathways that you would never get to. So you can\'t even get to - I mean if you think of yourself having walking muscles, you have maybe 5 miles walking muscles, and then you\'ve got 10-mile walking muscles, and then you\'ve got 20-mile walking muscles and so on. And so there are patterns, there are uses, there are depths to muscle use they can\'t get otherwise without this extended period of time. But there\'s that. But there\'s also ... we don\'t practice discomfort. So I could also say that my 20-mile walk was practicing discomfort. And so, yes, you can think of it as adaptation to endurance but it can also be a very conscious toe or foot into discomfort and dealing with it - the mental state of going ""I have to finish this thing,"" and that\'s something that\'s common, I would say, in many ceremonies. Traditionally is this idea that there would be milestones where you have to kind of get comfortable with discomfort - ironically becoming more comfortable. So, in the end, you are becoming more comfortable. \xa0But it\'s less because of - less because of a really marshmallow cozy place that you\'ve set up where you dwell and you\'re comfortable really given a broad variance of things that might happen. I\'ve had to do my 20-miles, or my 30-miles, or my 40-mile walks in pouring freezing rain. And that\'s just what I\'m to deal with. And so 20 miles could be a long distance walk. So could 7 miles. So could 3 miles. Just maybe pick something that sounds like it is beyond your comfort level and then try to do some prep for it obviously if your body is not conditioned to moving at all there would be many preparatory things that I recommend and have recommended ad exhaustion. But find something that feels slightly uncomfortable and do it, not just for the movement but for all of the other reasons. Okay, those are all my tips. Do you have anything else that you would want to leave the listeners with?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: I would just really like to echo the ideas that you just presented that come with long-distance walking that are suggesting that we need to sometimes be uncomfortable in order to be able to receive a benefit from a particular activity. \xa0I think that that idea that we were just talking about - the comfort and convenience - comfort is something that we're getting less and less able to move out of and the more we seek comfort, the smaller the set of conditions that we can actually be comfortable in. It's a sort of feedback loop. And so I'm just really very happy that I get to hear somebody else suggesting that we're not looking to have these terrible experiences where we're injuring ourselves, but we're moving beyond comfort barriers. \xa0So thanks for saying that."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: Well, you know, I feel like where this is still being said, I think that the idea of taking yourself through something that you know before you start is going to be hard, the fact that you choose it, the fact that you do it to completion, when you pass through that set of hoops there is a condition, a phenomenon. We can call it a nutrient, a feeling, I don't know if it's hormonal. I don't know. I haven't thought it through, but that what we're trying to create through comfort is like the synthetic version of what you get when you pass through those hoops. And the place that I still see people encouraging other people to pass through hoops comes in sports. Right?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: \xa0So we have, as a culture, it's almost like we've found this vitamin that we know is necessary but we've set up kind of athletics - I mean it's even celebrated really if you think of things like the Olympics - people who can push themselves. We love watching it. We want to hear the stories. It's so clear - you can see it on people's faces, and it's just been kind of exclusively presented as here's that way. Well, that is not the only way to get it. I mean I think that we can start thinking creatively and looking, again, historically to just appreciate what it is about that sporting process. And if you're getting it through sports, that's great. But if you're not getting it, sports doesn't have to be the sole way to challenge, test, and kind of put yourself against yourself and the environment, right? \xa0Which is what sports often are. Teamwork, right? The fact that you have to sometimes do it with people and move a whole group forward. Because I come from a movement science background and because populations moving that are probably studied the most in movement science are athletes. "", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'ARTHUR: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: \xa0That's kind of the source of movement - the bulk of movement knowledge right now is with this kind of small subset of people who do this thing which is challenging movement, persevere through pain and injury and come out the other side. But again, it's an ancestral practice. It's not rooted in sports. It's rooted in all those other things. Perseverance, discomfort, and triumph."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""ARTHUR: \xa0Yeah and that even includes diet. We're going back to the phytochemistry tip that we talked about earlier in this podcast. \xa0People will have a domesticated palate in terms of what chemistry they can tolerate, and we can try to expand our tolerance of bitters and spicy and other things that are indicative of greater levels of phytochemistry in plants. And ultimately, hopefully, expand our comfort region with those kinds of things. So this idea of pushing through and creating a greater tolerance has a lot of application for the things that we have been discussing."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Well Arthur, I want to be respectful of your time.

Can you tell us a little bit more about how your company got started? How does a chemist who works for General Electric end up developing foot alignment socks?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'EVA: \xa0Well it was really out of necessity. Because as you said, I am an avid tennis player and when I retired I had lots of time on my hands, so I was doing lots of physical activities. And my feet didn\'t like it that much. So I tried to do some home remedies from the catalog. They were all helpful, but they really were kind of user-unfriendly. And me being an on-hand person so I said, ""I can probably do something better."" \xa0And I made myself a pair cut out from the regular socks, the top, and sewn by hand. And I made a couple of prototypes and gave it to my friends who suffered the same with the feet. But the idea actually came from my yoga teacher. She said, put your fingers between your toes and wiggle it and holding it is good for your feet and so I thought, if it\'s a minute or two it\'s helpful.

So you had kind of an efficiency personality type of going, ""Ok, if I need to do this to get better I need to be able to do it for more than my time in class."" \xa0Ok, so making something to solve a problem for yourself and then mass producing something to take to market, what made you want to do that step?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'EVA: Well because I made several pairs and everybody just loved them. I said, ""Well, maybe just maybe, we can make a business out of it."" \xa0So, I was looking for a manufacturer. Of course in the United States, nobody even wanted to touch it because they like the idea but it wasn\'t a mass production at that time. An old lady has a good idea. That doesn\'t mean that you can put it into a big production. But fortunately I found the small company in China, later on, they went out of business as lots of small companies do, and they made a sample, and I liked them.

Which everyone who listens to this show knows I'm a big fan of getting movement while you're busy doing other things because many people don't have time to sit there and spread their toes and only spread their toes for a long period of time. \xa0So here's my question: I've recommended your socks for years. You've been selling your socks for years. At what point did you add to the label, or has it always been on there, the idea of if you're going to start wearing alignment socks ... and I just want to take a second to explain to everyone listening what alignment socks are. \xa0These are socks that basically don't cover the toes. Instead when you put them on your toes go through the socks so that you've got this kind of finger-sized bit of material between each toe which pushes your toes away from each other, which spreads the toes. Kind of like the exercise that I have people do a lot - it's the opposite if you wear tight shoes or shoes with small toe boxes that push your toes together, it's basically like a sock that does the opposite to what your too narrow shoes might be doing to your feet. \xa0So I've recommended them for years and when people put them on for the first time they can only wear them for a small amount of time before, you know, if you've sat with your fingers between your toes for 20 minutes, that's a lot of exercise. It's a lot of exercise for a tiny muscle that has spent a lifetime not getting that much movement. So at what point did you add the, it's not a warning, but kind of a user note saying, you use these little bits at a time until you're able to tolerate them for longer. Was that always from the beginning or was that based on user feedback?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""EVA: I think it was from the very beginning because I find that on myself that I couldn't take it too long. Or when I relaxed, and I had them on for a half an hour, took them off, it felt good. But when I tried to use it overnight, I just had to jump up and rip them off in the middle of the night because they were really uncomfortable for a longer period of time."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: \xa0Yeah.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'EVA: So I think that they were from the very beginning.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Can you sleep with them throughout a night now?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'EVA: Oh yeah. Yes.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: So I go through periods of just being really diligent about wearing my socks and then, you know, then I get diligent about doing other things. But I started putting them back on in the summer time when I was doing a lot of movement. I like them because they just keep my feet mobile which, in the end, really helps my knees and hips deal with a lot of exercise. Especially when I'm done with winter time when I've been in shoes. I kind of use them more as I'm transitioning more to summer feet, right? Where I'm usually barefoot more often. So they're part of my training program. But I still am not an all the way through the night person. If I put them on, I don't wake up and rip them off my feet. I take them off in my sleep at some point. \xa0I don't know when that is, but I've never been able to make it all the way through.

All bodies are welcome here. Are you ready to get movin'?"", ""KATY: My friends, we did it. Well, I guess you did it, really. Three million downloads of this little movement-rich podcast. That is a lot of fingers swiping, tiny ear movements, minds shifting, and probably millions of miles walked while listening! I wish there was some way to measure this. That would be pretty cool. If somehow you could send in the miles walked per episode so we can see just the dynamic nature of this show. But anyway, all of this says one thing to us here at Move Your DNA and that’s Podcast Party. Podcast party combined with our annual end of year movement/health recap. And today we’re going to be looking back on 2018, and looking forward to 2019. Our movement highs and lows. And you are invited. Oh look! \xa0You're here! Welcome! Lots of you sent us recordings of your answers to our health recap questions. Thank you so much for those. We loved listening to them, and we’ve included many of them in this episode. But even if you don’t hear yourself on this episode, just think about your answer for each of these questions as they go by. That's the whole point - to self-reflect, self-assess, and make a plan going forward. It's not that different than when you're trying to figure out how to build a movement program. Right? You self-reflect. You self- assess. Then you make a plan to go forward. So we're gonna include the full list of questions in our show notes of this episode so you can spend some time with them and make your own list of highs, lows, wanted tos, wish-I-dids and nailed-its. One thing I’ve learned about reaching goals, whether they are related to health and movement or something else entirely, is that it often takes a whole lot of vitamin community to make it happen. And I have been so fortunate to have an amazing community built around this podcast. I want to take a moment to thank all of the sponsors who helped make this podcast possible this year. So, that's our Dynamic Collective of "", ', ', ', ', ', and ', '.

So we use ', ', which we adapted to be focused around health and movement. I love looking back before I move forward. I like to see where I’ve come from. And actually part of prepping for this show requires that ', ""For me, it was spending so much time outside. I have spent more time outside than ever before in my life and that's because we have slept outside so many nights. So we sleep outside - that's an automatic 8 hours. And I think when I first started thinking about this a few years back my goal was 30 nights outside a year. And we've far exceeded that. And it's just, it's gotten to the point where - kind of like when you transition out of traditional shoes to minimal shoes you never really felt how you felt in a traditional shoe until you go put one on after not wearing one for years, you can really feel how it's pushing you around? \xa0That's how I feel inside now. I can feel inside on my body that I never could before. It took me spending a copious amount of time outside to realize just what inside felt like physically."", ""All right. Let's hear from one of you. "", ""MAHINA: \xa0Hi there. My name is Mahina and I currently live in Seattle. And in 2015 I had my first son. Despite what all the doctors said was a healthy normal pregnancy I had multiple postpartum complications which resulted in the loss of a lot of muscle and mobility. And two and a half years later I was still really struggling with chronic pain and new injuries every time I tried to exercise. \xa0After a lot of deliberation though my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a second child and so we started trying but I was really afraid of the toll it would take on my body. So I was trying really hard to get back into shape before getting pregnant again. And after injuring my trapezoid from the, get this, lying down on my son's bed to read him a story, ouch, I was seeing a massage therapist and telling him this long story and lamenting that I felt like I would never be pain-free again. \xa0And he recommended that I read a couple books and one of them was "", ' by Katy. And amazingly Katy had her ', ' which was so great for me because it takes me forever to get through physical books these days but I could listen to an audiobook while doing other things. And one day I was in the gym walking on the treadmill, listening to Katy, and I just had this ah-ha moment realizing that there were so many things that I know intuitively that I\'d learned throughout my life and my experiences that I ignored because they went against the societal norms and everything that I had been taught and raised with. So I quit the gym. I started walking outside. I changed my footwear. I changed my clothing. I really just changed my whole lifestyle. \xa0And now it\'s about a year later and I still have a long way to go in my personal movement journey, but I\'m currently 6 months pregnant with my second and honestly, I feel better than I did during my first pregnancy. I have a lot of people who will come up and be like, ""Oh. How are you doing?"" I feel great. I feel normal. Like maybe, you know, a little heavier in the pelvis and maybe my hips are a little tight, but the first time I had a whole list of complaints. Sciatica and this and that. This time I just feel much stronger and healthier. And so my greatest health triumph in 2018 has been getting healthier and becoming stronger while being pregnant which is something that I wouldn\'t have thought possible before attending one of Katy\'s movement workshops this past summer. So going forward I want my biggest health triumph in 2019 to be bouncing back to recovering from childbirth easily and quickly so that I can move forward with my life and focus on the things that really matter to me and my family. So thank you, Katy, and Happy New Year.', ""For me, it was making a 20 miler part of an almost monthly routine. I think that was, it was a decision that was in good alignment with kind of the exercise/movement volume that I was looking for and it's also a big dose of community for me just because of the situation in which I'm able to do this walk on a regular basis - the people that I'm able to do it with. It met just this undernourished area and it's so funny to look back on my own progress. The first time I ever walked 20 miles it blew my mind it was so hard and it was so challenging. And so to now make it kind of an almost monthly routine, it's like wow - I'm moving more. I'm getting more physically capable as I get older which I find very exciting. So Artemus MacCallum wanted to answer this one."", 'ARTEMUS: The smartest decision my wife and I made in 2018 was to leave our jobs in New York City to camp in the country for 6 months with absolutely no idea where we\'d eventually settle other than to hope that it would be a place where we could connect more directly with non-manmade nature more often. In many ways our trip was much like the movie, ""Away We Go"" with Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski, except instead of being pregnant, we did it with a 3-year-old. As camping newbies this trip\'s changed our lives in all the ways you can imagine and helped my wife and I understand just how badly we wanted to restructure everything to be in direct union with mother earth as a way of life. As a result, I became a serious trail runner, of course. And my wife is starting an online presence on the topic of sustainability in all of the ways. So just like in the movie Away We Go, after starting in my home state of North Carolina and heading west, we ultimately settled on the first trails we fell in love with here in Asheville, North Carolina near the great smokies. \xa0So much of your work, Katy, has inspired this trip. So we are forever indebted to the very real ways your work has helped changed our lives. We love you as if we\'ve been friends for years precisely because that\'s how it feels. Thanks for everything.', ""KATY: Wow, thank you Artemus. That was a great answer. And I'm waving at you and yours, you know who. I'll see you soon! "", ""ANNI: That word for me is recalibration. So I moved to North Dakota from California at the beginning of the year, which you are probably thinking that's quite a jump in terms of miles on the map, but particularly weather, climate, environment, and amount of sunshine. Which you'd be correct in all of those things. It's very different. So back in California I was very much used to being outdoors every day of the year, 365 days. There really wasn't weather that could stop you. And that's not the case here in North Dakota. We have days that are base temperature negative 20 something. And so it's hard to stay motivated in the winter to get outdoors and walk outdoors. So the start of the year 2018, January, I really didn't move much outdoors at all. And so it started to take a toll on my body. I had more heel pain. My mood was affected. And tune in through the rest of the year and I find your podcast in the summertime and hear you speak about walking and the benefits of just more movement in general. And now that it's the tail end of 2018, winter is officially here in North Dakota. \xa0So, I've geared up. I've changed the equipment that I have. I have really awesome snow boots that have no heel which is wonderful. And I've got all the warm gear you could really possibly imagine. So I've had to change and recalibrate my mindset to get a little bit more motivated and understand the benefits of being outdoors, not just walking but walking outdoors. And I've had to change my equipment. But either way it is December here in Grand Forks and I'm looking forward to moving more and moving more of my parts this winter. So thank you, Katy."", ""And I was thinking about this and this is just recently for me. I just got done with it a few days ago. And it was joyfully, equanimously tending to my family while sending my husband for 12 days to a meditation course. \xa0And I know that many people out there, maybe even many people listening certainly my mother tended her children by herself our whole childhood. But this was still, it was the fact that I wanted, I knew that there would be just for the way our lives are set up, I work a lot, sometimes upward of 80 hours per week and so to assume the responsibilities of homeschooling and doing basically the work that the two of us co-parents share ... sending someone else off for almost 2 weeks, that was a loving thing. And to not be frustrated while I do it. Just to kind of keep back, checking, and going, no I'm doing this for someone else to allow them the growth that they're looking for. So that was probably the most loving thing I did - if we're going to relate the amount of love to the amount of work assumed for love. I love people and do stuff for people all the time but not in a way that challenges my boundaries. And I would say that my boundaries were definitely challenged."", ""Let's hear from Kathleen about what she did:"", ""KATHLEEN: \xa0Dear Katy. I'm a nutritious Movement certified Restorative Exercise Specialist since 2017. I came upon your work several years ago when I was searching for yet another way to relieve my chronic and worsening neck pain. In addition to your restorative exercises, I've also incorporated yoga, chiropractic, massage, rolfing, anti-inflammatory diets, etc., etc., into my life. However, no matter the modality my progress with my neck pain was always limited and it was a pain that I just acquiesced to live with. \xa0That is, until October of 2018. Another thing to know about me is that I've always felt pretty shy or timid. I was terrified of public speaking until I began teaching yoga in 2012. When I first started teaching my voice used to tremble uncontrollably. But I got over it. Speaking in a safe place like a yoga studio helped me to overcome my fear of public speaking. I didn't start speaking up or speaking out all over the place. I just mean I didn't tear up or feel like my face was burning off when all eyes in the room turned to me. This summer I read the book: Let My People Go Surfing by Patagonia founder, Yvon Chouinard. It's both a guide to running an ethical sustainable business and also a call to activism and reading it was life-changing for me. I hadn't had an existential crisis like this one since I read "", '. \xa0Then in September, I had another life-altering experience. I found a child who had been abandoned in a parking lot. Helping this helpless child and speaking up for him stirred something in me that I didn\'t know I had. Just like it feels when you begin to tap into the power of your underused lateral hip muscles, I started to tap into the power of my underused voice. I began to feel a true need to stand up vocally for what I believe in. To speak out against any injustices that I saw. So I wrote a letter to the editor of my local paper about the separation of migrant families at the border. I contacted my city government with some environmental initiatives that I wanted to implement on our beach, and I started asking my office colleagues to recycle. And then on October 8, something new happened. With little notice and under a shroud of secrecy, the real estate master developer of my city, Asbury Park New Jersey, started construction at the beach by my house. So I started researching what was going on. And boy has it been some rabbit hole to go down. To summarize, it turned out that the developer was building infrastructure to eventually support a new private beach club and also a 15 townhome devel0pment concept that has been highly contested for years. It also turned out that the permit granted by the New Jersey\'s department of environmental protection to perform this construction was issued in 2004, nearly 15 years ago. That\'s well before Hurricane Sandy ravaged our shoreline in 2012. The permit to build on this lot is based off of flood maps from 1983. So, I started asking my neighbors if they knew what was going on and what they thought. And none of us were pleased. To give it some context the boardwalk is like the femoral artery of the Jersey shore. People have both a physical and emotional attachment to these boards. You can\'t just go tearing them up without any notice. \xa0So my group of concerned neighbors started talking to some other neighbors throughout the city and together we realized that these developments proposed for Asbury\'s waterfront would discourage public enjoyment of the boardwalk and beach. They will adversely affect our changing coastal environment. They don\'t promote social inclusion or our cities diversity. And when the developer commences the construction of the private club, it will develop on one of the largest remaining coastal open spaces in Monmouth County. So we formed a coalition known as Save Asbury\'s Waterfront with a mission to foster and encourage appropriate development on the waterfront. We met with our elected and appointed city officials. The city agreed that the developer had to make a presentation at the November 8th city council meeting. We made flyers and we encouraged everyone to attend. We talked to anybody who would listen. We engaged with environmental and social justice organizations and also our elected state representatives. We contacted local and regional media and they still continued to air our story. On November 8, well over 400 residents showed up for the council meeting and after 2.5 hours of public comments, the city council of Asbury Park issued an order to cease and desist construction immediately and ordered the developer to return to the table to negotiate the cities 2002 waterfront redevelopment plan. Now 3 weeks later my group is working together with the city and the developer towards a forward-looking, transparent, and sustainable plan for our city\'s waterfront and it has been an incredible experience. Now I did not set out this year to be on the news or introduce my state lawmakers at a press conference that I organized. Nor did I set out to demand that a publicly traded Manhattan real estate developer stop, reflect, and readjust its plans. But by exercising my voice in concert with the voices in my community, I am helping to shape the future of Asbury Park, its socioeconomic and environmental future. \xa0So what does all of this have to do with my neck? Well, it hasn\'t been hurting since I started speaking up and using my voice. As you elegantly discuss in our essay Analogous in Movement Matters: ""Rivers are shaped by the forces that flow through them."" And my voice is a force, flowing through my neck just like water flowing through a river. And the dam that was holding it back for so long is now gone. I observed that the sedentarism of my voice was perhaps my vitamin deficiency and that there\'s no corrective exercise more powerful than activism. I will remember 2018 as the year that I found my voice. The year that I improved my own personal ecosystem by engaging with and improving the ecosystem around me.', ""KATY: I'm not that much of a crier but I have found listening to these answers, they're really bringing tears to my eyes. So let me wipe those away. "", 'And I was thinking about this and we had planned to live outside for 2 months in 2018. We were going to do it September to November, \xa0but as many of you know, we just launched a ', '. And the new website is full of ', "" that took two productions. So every production is 4 to 5 days and basically shooting video all day. So,\xa0during September to November we designed a new website, built a new website, shot two productions. That was 8 days of me being on camera all day. And we also had a massive live 2-week long training with both Nutritious Movement teachers and the MovNat staff. And we couldn’t make, as a family we couldn't make it happen. Or rather we chose not to do it. It was just, I know we want to do this thing for our well-being, this living outside for two months but this is not the time to do it. \xa0So I really, I had really wanted to do it. It was part of our personal mission statement. It was exactly what our family had defined that it needed to be well, but we couldn't make it happen. Now I want you to hear from an old friend about her biggest piece of unfinished health or movement business in 2018."", 'DANI: Hello Katy! \xa0How are you? All right, Betty. I\'m gonna answer these end of the year health questions. I love this. Number six: \xa0What was your biggest piece of unfinished health or movement business in 2018? Ok, this is crazy but I believe my word to sum up my movement health in 2018 was going to be ""Altitude"" because I wanted to climb and do lots of hiking. Well, unfortunately, in April, I ended up with a torn quad tendon. So, not only was hiking out of the question, but walking was a huge deal and very hard for me up until a couple months ago. So my biggest piece of unfinished health or movement business in 2018 was I just didn\'t get the altitude I wanted. Fortunately, now I am healed. \xa0And so that\'s gonna be one of my goals this next year.', ""For me, it was learning how to jump. And I want to thank MovNat for that. I've never been a jumper. Even as a kid I don't really remember leaping off things. I do remember climbing onto roofs and stuff quite a bit. Never jumping. And so to have discovered jumping at 42 ... When we did this big training with MovNat and Nutritious Movement we went through a level one training and the fact that in a matter of a handful of days, in less than 2 days, I could jump from a yoga block, you know, just on my toes on a yoga block and jump six feet and land on another yoga block over a stack of yoga blocks between the two. Meaning I actually had to have a little height on my jump. That just blows me away that that's something I can do. So I was most happy, most joyful, most kid-like, about completing that in 2018. \xa0Now I loved this answer from Annette Cashell."", "" \xa0Monkey Bars hands down. Or I should say hands up. Two years ago I was suffering from severe nerve pain in my right arm. It was caused by three bulging discs in my neck. The pain was constant and the pain meds didn't work. I was told a neck fusion operation was inevitable. The idea of this absolutely terrified me so I started researching alternative routes. \xa0I came across Katy Bowman's work. Her home video on living furniture free absolutely fascinated me. I started incorporating some of her ideas into my life and signed up for the two-year certification program. Two years on, I feel no pain in my arm. There's no neck fusion operation on the horizon. And I can do the monkey bars. I cannot fully explain the thrill of being able to carry my own body weight across this set of bars. I would say I feel like a kid again. But I'm not sure I could even do this when I was a kid. I'm no spring chicken either. In five days time, on Christmas eve, I turn 50. A big birthday. And this year I'm giving myself a big present. You guessed it. A set of monkey bars installed right here in my dining room. Best birthday present ever."", 'KATY: All right. \xa0So there we have it. I really feel like movement goals that make us happy might be the ones that are kind of tickling these ... childlike is not the right word because it assumes that you\'re only supposed to feel like this as a kid. It\'s really just joyfully exploring your physicality. And then,\xa0of course I think when you see that there\'s something in your body that feels better because you\'re pursuing this joyful ... what is the word that I\'m looking for? It\'s just a smile. It\'s whatever the word is for the way your face feels when it\'s smiling. \xa0The fact that it\'s challenging and that it rings you out and that you find your edge. I\'m just thinking of nature school. Nature school for kids, and for grownups too - wilderness skills - is all about pushing you to some edge because the edge is where you grow. You can\'t really grow if you\'re not on the edge of something. And so because we tend to stay comfortable in the middle we don\'t grow that much. So maybe all that air quotes around ""childlike"" is is just the sensation of growth. Right? And so in that way we stop being childlike because we stop growing. So I have found that just both through my thinking about the answer, and certainly Annette\'s, it really feels like growth is joyful. \xa0', ""And I'm gonna have to start with MovNat which is not a person, but a movement system. But it's represented by people, by their team. And we have just completed, during the time that I should have been living outside but I wasn't, we completed a collaborative project with them and their and our staff cross-trained for a week. And it was maybe the most fun I've ever had. The MovNat team is just - they're really phenomenal people. They're phenomenal movers, yes, but the group of people was just amazing. So to be able to spend that time alongside the Nutritious Movement team and the MovNat team, they greatly impacted my health and certainly my movement in 2018 in ways that I've already mentioned and ways that I'm going to continue to mention and share going on in 2019. So that's one. \xa0Even though that was ... gosh, there was 40 of us total. So those are a team of 20 folks. And then also we have "", '. And Haere Mai, she\'s definitely, just like having, you know, when we had really little kids, movement is such a priority because everything is informing that. The hours outside, the long-distance trekking, those were things that we just prioritized, two to three times a day. And it\'s - you\'re back to kind of square one when you have a puppy, which is basically like a toddler. And so it just kind of renewed, not just mine but also the kids now. \xa0And I, it\'s kind of fun to explain to them. ""She needs to leap. She needs to run free. She needs to go through some complex terrain. You can\'t pick her up and put her on the thing she\'s gonna how to figure out how to get here. That\'s how she learns. So they\'ve kind of almost gotten a parenting lesson or certainly a lesson in how we parented them in the sense of, I guess, cultivating physical development. Because they get to lead her on those walks. So it kind of revved up their desire to go out and explore complex terrain. Because it\'s like we want to do it for this dog. In the same way that we wanted to do it for our kids, the kids want to do it for the dog. And it just goes on and on. So that was definitely great. And then finally, see none of these are actually people. This is a terrible answer. I\'ve got a team of trainers, I have a puppy. My third person that had the greatest impact on my health or movement is really the entire community where I live in the Olympic Peninsula. In my efforts to still do the work that I do in the world but not in an online format, I went back to where I started which was creating a ', "" So it's just opening next month. I'll "", "" if you want to go take a tour of it. You're all welcome to come out and take a class up here. It's where I teach regularly. Where a lot of our other teachers teach regularly. And we just have lots of workshops that are coming through. You'll see on our website if you go to "", "" which ones are located at our studio up here. But it's really, again, in contemplating the state of the world and the fact that so many things need attention and I do have a strong desire to be efficient. And so I thought the ultimate way of tending to my own physicality, to my own body of work, to the bodies of the people that share space with me, in crisis, it's really the person closest to me that I'm going to turn to. There's a lot of things that are happening online but as far as things that are happening where you are, I found equivalents to all the big things that are happening online happening within my own community so addressing them in a community format has been powerful for me. And it's just starting. It's just starting at the end of 2018. So I can't wait to do this recap in 2019. \xa0"", ""So the biggest surprise for me was how much I loved jumping as an exercise and just in my natural movement practice. And I think what was the greatest lesson was through the process of learning to jump, and because I'm always trying to stack it - see how it fits into my life - I've learned that there's so many more movements not only to explore but to figure out how I can stack them. So the greatest lesson is: this is still only the beginning. \xa0That I've got nothing figured out really. All I have are a few key principles. I figured out a few key principles but the principles aren't practical. They're just equations. And that the practicality is how you apply those principles. And that's a knowledge that I'm currently after. And the greatest lesson I have is that this is my life's work as a person with my own physicality in my own community, as a human being on this planet. That I'm just getting started and I have some key ideas that I can work with physically but that the working with them is far more important than the principles themselves. \xa0That the principles themselves don't do anything. That it's what you do with the principles that makes change."", ""So these questions were also linked for Carol Robbins. Here's her answers:"", 'CAROL: I really can\'t talk about 2018 without mentioning my ankle fracture. \xa0Which is saying a lot because I broke my arm in the same year. But that was relatively minor. \xa0And my ankle was pretty catastrophic. It was a trimalleolar fracture and it wasn\'t so much a surprise as a shock. \xa0It was such a shock, in fact, that I refused to believe that it was broken until I saw the x-rays. From the time that the accident occurred till the traveling to the hospital and then the waiting in emergency and then waiting for the doctor and so on, it all takes a lot of time. And then going into radiology and then having the doctor come back and saying, ""It\'s broken."" \xa0It\'s like, ""What? This can\'t be happening to me. I\'m a movement professional."" So, that was extremely surprising and also the fact that I just kind of assumed that it would be better really quickly. Like I would have the surgery and it would be better. And then it was like, oh, well I need a cast. Well after the cast comes off, I\'ll be better. And then it was like, oh, I need a walking boot. Ok, well after the walking boot comes off, I\'ll be better. \xa0And then it was like, ok, I still don\'t have range of motion. Ok, in three months I\'ll be better, and I\'ll have range of motion back. And then in another three months after that, I might have an ankle that looks somewhat like the ankle I used to have. So that brings me to the question greatest lesson you learned about health in 2018, and that is that the body has its own schedule and that you need to respect it and work with it and do your best to support it. Because it\'s really doing its very best for you. So that is my answer. I hope that is interesting to someone out there. And hope that 2019 is a year of recovery and no more surprises. Bye for now.', ""And I would say it's the one with myself through working in various ways, specifically exploring the difference between my - what I'll call - my wildest self and the facade that sits on top of that to sort of cope/survive in civilization. So the biggest risk that I'm just starting to take in 2018 which is another one of the questions here, and I'm gonna do more of it in 2019, is to reduce that difference. Right? To make ... I mean I understand, \xa0and I know many of you have done a lot of work in the psychological sense recognizing, again, what I'm gonna call my wildest self and you know, kind of the ego that's around that. I'd like to reduce that difference so that the wildest self is what is mostly presenting. Obviously, we live in society and that society is built around quite a bit of suppression of the wildest self. But the risk I'm wanting to take that I'm willing to take, that I'm starting to take, is in reducing that difference, it becomes risky because it possibly alienates many that are prioritizing the current society over its more wild counterpart. And so we just have to accept, I have to just accept, that other people's discomfort is not my discomfort. \xa0And then, of course, playing with how that all sits in the fact that we all share space. Doing it in a live community. There's that kind of sharing space, and then there's sharing virtual space. Really delineating between actual space and virtual space, I think is key. So I am really engaging more in live community, live spaces, to make sure that I'm able to use all of the tools that come with a living body or person. It's interesting in virtual spaces. Because in virtual spaces almost all of your expressions are reduced to symbols of text. Sometimes there's video which helps. But for someone who writes a lot on the internet and writes books, you're taking ideas that are embodied in physical, wild spaces with other human beings and you're reducing them to symbols. Another person's brain is taking those symbols and then are having to reconstruct what they think you mean. It's a big challenge. So I have found one way to be more effective is just to spend less time communicating in symbols. And more time communicating with all the tools, right? The facial expressions. \xa0Touch. Gesturing. Demonstrating. You know - the fact that maybe you say a certain thing but you're physical actions and behaviors don't match up. But if all anyone has is those handful of symbols, they're going to construct a whole reality from those symbols. Yeah, this podcast has gone 2001. Not the year but the novel has gone really fast. This is a little Sci-Fi. Anyway, I'm just working on that relationship with myself and then, of course, bringing that face to face with everyone else."", ""Here's what Karen Barnes in Seattle says:"", 'KAREN: Have to say it\'s the relationship I have with myself. My self-confidence improved a ton this year with my reentry into the workforce. I finally got a green card in March. I\'m a Canadian living in the U.S., and I\'m a stay at home mom. And I was finally able to align my personal movement goals with my job. I had become a yoga instructor in 2016 and had been teaching Karma Yoga, but I was able to launch it into a business where I could actually go out and legitimately help other people do activities that benefit them. Throughout my time in Seattle, being a stay at home mom, I was the one at the playground that was always trying to encourage others to get moving. And so when the kids were playing, I would talk to the other moms and say, ""Hey instead of standing around, let\'s go walk around. Let\'s keep moving our bodies and doing something as our kids are able to move their bodies. And the self-confidence that came from having that ability to be able to start up a business has really made my life blossom this year. My self-confidence has improved greatly as has my ability to be confident enough to approach people and to get people to participate with me in doing activities. And then the more people participated with me and did yoga with me, the more that I was able to see that there were people that were interested and people that were stagnating at home that wanted to move their bodies in a better and healthier way. And it made me feel good that they were coming to me to help them.', 'And this would be an all-caps shouting: ""Goodbye social media! Get out of my head."" \xa0I probably won\'t be doing this or yelling this before the end of the year though. But it is, it\'s a very strong intention. I need to say it to be complete with 2018. I feel it on a daily basis. Now I am verbally expressing it. And then hopefully soon I can physically embody the thing that I know needs to happen. There\'s still some fear around that though. All right. Now let\'s hear from our good friend, Stephanie Domet. ', 'STEPHANIE: So there are two things that I need to do or say in order to be complete with 2018 and move on. I guess there\'s one thing I have to do and one thing I have to say. \xa0The thing I have to do is actually walk 100 kilometers this month. I\'m in a group of friends, and we challenge each other to do that, and my work can be very sedentary. I write for long hours. I\'m at my desk. And though I try to make that time as dynamic as possible, sometimes when I\'m really cooking I forget. So, it\'s been hard for me to even achieve that 100 Kilometers a month this year. And I\'m gonna do it in December. I\'m doing it. I\'ve told you. It\'s my pledge. It\'s happening. \xa0And then the thing I need to say to be complete with 2018 is ""it\'s ok."" Where you are is ok. It\'s always ok, and you\'re ok. It\'s simple advice, but sometimes I need to hear it from myself.', ""And I'm gonna go back to those two months living outside. We are planning on taking those two months outside in the spring of 2019. So that. That's gonna be my biggest health triumph. And I'd also like to move continuously for an entire day in ceremony form. So I'm thinking it's like maybe 40-50 miles walking or something like that. And I have got an invite I know from one of you to that 50-mile walk that's happening on the east coast. So I'm thinking maybe something like that that might happen. Or maybe it has to happen in a format that I create myself. But yes, those are my plans for 2019. \xa0Now let's hear from Dani - I know everyone's going YAY - on what she'd like her biggest health triumph to be."", 'DANI: Ok. I have thought a lot about this because there\'s a lot of things. And I know you think I\'m gonna say, ""I\'d like to do that pull-up."" \xa0But you\'re wrong. I\'m about 1/3 of the way to that pull-up and I\'ve been working really hard, but I\'m not there yet. It\'s not going to be my biggest health triumph though because I already know I\'m going to accomplish it. So I\'ve kind of already got it in the bag. I think for me I would like to increase my cardio capacity. I took adult swimming lessons this fall, and I found out I really liked it. And I also found out it\'s really difficult. \xa0Because I just didn\'t have the cardio capacity. So the biggest health triumph this next year? Increase my cardio capacity.', ""KATY: All right, health advice you want to give yourself for 2019? \xa0For me, it's slow down. It's just slow down. I'm a hyper-producer so slowing down is gonna be fantastic. \xa0Lindsay Silva in Texas had this timely advice:"", ""LINDSAY: \xa0And that is simply to stop letting perfect being the enemy of the good. \xa0I have a bad tendency to compare myself with other people on social media who I see - they're natural movers, naturally moving in these natural settings that are just so gorgeous and it feels sometimes like, oh my gosh, I live in the inner city in a not so nice part of town. If I'm not leaping from trees and swimming in crystal streams and foraging all my foods, does it all count? And it absolutely does count. And the more I have allowed myself to get creative and look around at what objects and environments actually do have to interact with around me, I'm realizing that it might not be a gorgeous sequoia tree or it might not be or I might not have many opportunities for urban foraging or very limited ones, but that doesn't mean that what I do have is not good enough and doesn't offer me a lot of movement variety. And so I'm trying to get better about not comparing myself and also for allowing myself to be creative and to accept and love what I do have around me. And I'm hoping I can do this because I kind of have gotten off of Instagram and Facebook specifically because of the comparison which is too strong. I really miss the community and the people who I was able to connect with using those platforms just around the world. So I'm going to try to make more of an effort to work on my thought processes around this, my attitude around this, and just be thankful and excited to be able to move at all. And to go out and be creative with my environment and what I've actually got out here. Anyway that is, those are kind of my health goals. So thank you again for this opportunity, and I hope that you have a happy and movement-rich 2019. Thank you. Bye-bye."", ""KATY: How are you going to change your movement results in 2019? \xa0For me, it's just giving up the internet as much as possible. So I want to get my work done. I want to reevaluate how much work I need to do as a whole, of course. But then after that, I want to go the heck outside. I just want to do the minimum and be done with the internet. And I've been slowly able to reduce it. And it's really screens in general. \xa0It's going back to the idea of screen-free week. I've just noticed it's challenging as all of the systems are slowly put onto screens, stepping away from them really requires stepping away from a large portion of the culture. So, I'm gonna feel brave and just do that anyway. And again I think it's gonna do well with some of our living outside and just being outside more. Because if you're outside more, you tend to just be away from where those screens are located. I mean I guess you can always have one in your pocket, but in general moving away from where they are located in abundance or plugged in and have an unlimited supply of juice so that you can engage whenever possible, I think that's gonna help.\xa0 What are you going to try to complete in 2019, or what would you be happy to complete? I'm happy and scared to say that it is a new book. I'm gonna say more soon. But I will say it's a book about babies and kids moving. And that it's also about families moving alongside of course, so some movement ecology focusing on juveniles to put it in biological terms. Sarah Ellen is an exercise science student in Atlanta Georgia and here's her answer."", ""SARAH: I would do an actual happy dance if by the end of 2019 I could move each of my toes independently. I would even settle for being able to lift my big toes without bringing all the other ones up with them. I have spent the last five years transitioning from a smooshed toe, high-heels lifestyle to a more barefoot existence. It has been a slow process, but I've made a lot of changes to move my feet more and move them better. \xa0I've invested in minimal footwear. I exercise and move in bare feet as much as possible. I move over different terrains and elevations and use tools like yoga-toes and Tune Up balls to get some movement during more sedentary parts of my day. All of this work has produced big results in my feet and ankles. My whole body really. I actually went down a half shoe size as I developed an arch in my foot. My calves were so short that I used to walk upstairs on my tiptoes. And I can now perform this action flat-footed. My balance has improved tremendously. \xa0I honestly could talk about all the system-wide changes this has produced at length, but the one part of this foot rehabilitation program that has been neglected is moving my toes. When I do devote some time to toe mobility exercises, I feel like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, laying paralyzed in the back seat of the car willing herself aloud, wiggle your big toe. It takes great effort to produce even the slightest independent movement. The ability to move my big toes independently would represent a health triumph for me, not just because of the result, more movement and more parts of my body, but also because of the process to achieve that result. I honestly don't have 10 minutes every day to devote solely to toe mobility. So I know that producing the results I want will mean more stacking my life: choosing and creating environments that produce the results I want. Changing an environment, a lifestyle, as opposed to adding a new exercise to an already busy schedule means that that change will be sustainable over a lifetime and that is something to celebrate."", ""KATY: \xa0This is a great question. I always have a hard time answering this one every year. What indulgence are you going to experience? What are you willing to do? So I had to ask my husband, what does indulgence actually mean in this context. And for me, it's gonna be cooking outside. So again it's all centered around this being outside. Now if you've been following social media or newsletters or other articles that I'm writing, I have been cooking outside a lot. Not a lot in that I cook three meals a day, every single day of the year practically. So as far as a percentage of outside cooking it's pretty small. But compared to what I did before it's quite large. I love love love "", '. And I don\'t mean typical camp food. So there\'s camping and backpacking, and there\'s the foods that are lightweight and easy that go along with that. And so that\'s great too, but what I\'m talking about is, I love to cook. If I had one art, it would probably be cooking. I really enjoy it. But then I also like cooking outside. So I didn\'t want to be limited to kind of like air quotes again around ""camp food"" so I bought myself a handful of outdoor campfire cookbooks. I just ', "". They're really great. They're really beautiful, and they're really indulgent. So I want to make beautiful meals for my family and my friends that are joining us on our trip of outdoor living. We're going to be going throughout the United States because I have to work anyway at a lot of different locations so we thought we would just - we're just moving people overall in the largest sense. So changing landscapes. So we thought that we would - I thought that I would create this kind of cooking box. Like a lot of the books are not just cookbooks. They really show you here's how you organize for people who are doing van life or are fairly nomadic anyway. I have a lot of friends, actually, who they don't have permanent homes. They just move around a lot and live in outside spaces. So just kind of to join them in this idea of having an organized outside set of kitchen tools, indulgent meals, and cast iron pot. That's what I'm going to be doing in 2019. I'm very excited. Stop by for dinner! \xa0So that's mine. And now I love this goal from Vivi Dumoulin:"", 'VIVI: \xa0An indulgence for me would be more cups of tea in wild places. In 2019 I would like to do an overnight hike once a month in the beautiful natural parks that we have in Southeast Queensland Australia.', ""KATY: Don't you just those outside wilderness sounds? \xa0I think that the soundscape is really important. If you can indulge in a little bit of outside soundscape this upcoming year, it's really therapeutic. "", ""Ok we're getting towards the end. What would you like to most change about your health in 2019? And I feel like I'm beating the same drum here. \xa0I'd like to dramatically scale back the computer-based work that needs to be done. So I work about 80 hours a week which is a lot. Fortunately, I can stack a lot of it. I am fortunate in that I have a full-time co-parent and that the nature of my work is often nature and outside and moving. So there's a lot of people who work 80 hours a week in an office that nothing else is really being met. So it's not a complaint by any means. It is just recognition that I think 80 hours of production is an amount that doesn't allow for a tremendous state of balance. So I'm fine working, and I actually believe work is really all that we're owed in life, but I'd like more of that work to be of the physical nature and more of that work to be directly sowing the things that we need. So that would mean more work in planting and tending plants. \xa0More gardening. More hunting. So I wouldn't like to relax more. That's not what my goal is. My goal is to not have so much screen-based work. I expect the amount of work to stay the same - or actually increase. It's just that what my work is - I'd like to shift that a little bit. Stephanie Domet is going to weigh in on what she would like most to change about her health in 2019."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0In 2019 I'd like to take a more integrated approach to my health. In recent years I've realized that what I've thought was just the way my mind works is actually a little anxiety. And that sometimes keeps me from doing things that I know are healthy and that I would really like to do. And so my goal in 2019 is to find ways to get on top of that anxiety or at least to be able to work with it instead of it working against me. And then from there to be able to really commit to some of the healthy habits that I know would be transformational for me. So that is what I would most like to change about my health in 2019."", ""KATY: What are you gonna learn in 2019? \xa0I can't wait to find out! I have no idea! \xa0What's your risk - greatest risk - for 2019? And I think for me it's owning my positions more. \xa0What are you most committed to changing and/or improving in 2019? That's gonna be less screen time to simplify and Annette Cashell; she's gonna share hers."", "" \xa0What am I most committed to changing and/or improving in 2019. \xa0And the answer is: The sitting habits of primary school children in Ireland. In 2018 I started a project called Movement Makeovers for Primary Schools. I was thrilled when it got accepted into a mentoring program run by Social Opportunity Ireland. \xa0The aim of my idea was to make schools more movement friendly, changing the environment to encourage movement throughout the day. By movement I don't mean exercise. I mean small bouts of movement spread throughout the day applicable to all children, whether they're sporty or not. We already know that desk workers sit way too much. But school children don't seem too far behind for me. Especially if we insist of them sitting for six hours a day and we know that they're on their tech devices for hours after school. So, I set up a six-week trial run at a local school to look at ways of adding more movement into the school environment. Each week a new movement idea was introduced. The children experimented with it for the week, and then I collected the feedback. One week they might be encouraged to sit on the floor more. The next week they might go barefoot. Then they might differently or use chair wedges or use Katy Bowman's movement posters or take more eye breaks. I was simply blown away by the support of the teachers and by the enthusiasm of their children and their pure appetite for more movement. Now, following the success, I'm discussing with various stakeholders in Ireland, to get these ideas circulated more widely and hopefully incorporated into more schools. These days there's a lot of talk about keeping kids safe in the digital age. But how about we keep them healthy too. I, for one, am committed to trying."", ""KATY: What underdeveloped talent are you willing or planning to explore in this upcoming year? \xa0I'm gonna stay with hunting. I think I said that last year as well. It's learning how to hunt and gather more from the land. There's a lot of great organizations that we have in our government here that are helpful for that. I did more fishing this year than ever before. But I'm just gonna keep going on with that theme. And also, plant identification and gathering. It's really all the how can I personally with as little waste as possible, with the greatest state of consciousness as I can - or mindfulness is probably the better word - as mindfully as possible consume. And for me, that really requires understanding the natural biorhythms, the ecology of where I live. So I'm gonna keep on that. "", ""What brings you joy and health and how are you going to have more of that in 2019? \xa0It's wilderness for sure. I'm gonna get more of it by getting the stuff in my way out of my way which requires just paying attention to what's stopping me or what feels like it's stopping me and clearing it. Whatever that takes. \xa0Lindsay Silva, what are you gonna do in 2019?"", ""LINDSAY: \xa0I am going to try to start collecting more trash while I'm out on my walks. That has actually been a really big part of my movement journey is realizing just how much as a society we rely upon single-use products - the convenience things - and what's that doing to our planet and just clogging up our world. And so I am now trying to intentionally change my consumer habits of things that I buy or don't buy or how I buy them, actually because of my movement practice. And kind of seeing the waste on the ground as I was walking through my neighborhood. So thank you for that because I don't think that I ever would have gotten started on this. I was already recycling, but I was not thinking about but how do I not create the waste to start with. And now I have started on that, and it has drastically changed how I consume items now. So thank you so much for your podcast that had this really kind of cool unintended or unforeseen effect on my consumer habits. So I'm going to start to try to collect at least one small bag of trash, at least one walk a week as a way to just kind of feel like I'm doing something more for the planet because everytime that I've done it, it does bring me greater joy in my health. Because I feel like I'm doing something at the same time ... I'm doing something good for my body. I'm also doing something good for the planet. And that is extremely important to me and helps me feel very edified. And I'm actually doing something meaningful with my time as opposed to just racking up miles or spending X amount of minutes moving my body in a certain way. So I'm going to try to make more of a conscious, deliberate effort to collect, like I said, at least one small bag of trash at least one walk a week."", 'KATY: Other than yourself who are you most committing to loving and serving. The answer for me is going to be my kids which is probably not that uncommon of an answer. But they\'re growing up so fast and I just, I realize that they\'re essence, their soul is forming in the environments that I\'m creating. And we\'ve really tried, as a family, to clear out things so that they can establish a more wild perspective. Right? \xa0There\'s a lot of things that we have never had or that we\'ve found was intervening with kind of their ability to engage with that wild self. But I can do better by looking at my own time and the way that I\'m working. And, again, it\'s not about not working. We all work. It\'s just about how. It\'s just about how. And it\'s also about when I am using things like the internet that\'s not work, like to really be better about that.

But I would add holding things while you walk. Um you know, we just had a big week-long training here. \xa0And we were practicing river crossing with our group. \xa0Oh, and we were actually on a log in a rushing river. It was pretty wide. It was a good foot wide. But it\'s in the deep river on the other side, crossing where you had to go around another person crossing on the other way towards you.

Like a green smoothy then doesn\'t provide you the same nutrients as masticating all of the pieces that you had in this green smoothie. \xa0And I have this dream - I stopped blogging - but if I could open that thing up in a second I\'d do it.

Just hanging out.', ""KATY: Just hanging out so that's been part of my movement. I actually think of it as movement.

I'm talking about major change with like ... I went to a panel, a dentistry panel at the ancestral health symposium. To hear all the dentists talking about surgeries to pull out and mechanically transduce through different hardware the forces that would have been on the jaw you know through mastication and nursing. They're trying to duplicate it through surgeries. Because you get to a certain point and there's not much that you can do. So we're glad that we have these technologies.

I like to keep the full picture. I don't want to make that really small picture that I read about in so many things published a hundred years ago.

That my ability to actually reduce my strain requires many many years. And it might take a few generations of gathering a skill set and again a relationship with people will use the term landscape, but that might even be my backyard or I started with containers years and years ago. My pots. It\'s the same as going to minimal footwear. \xa0How much does me going barefoot a few hours reduce the strain of the fact that I need shoes? \xa0This is kind of pulling on some of the things we talked about in one of the shoe episodes where I was trying to highlight the weaker your feet the more often you need to wear shoes. And the more it requires that natural terrain be covered with some sort of protective cement so that you can move on top of it safely. You know what I mean? So in that way you require the hardness of or the covering of the earth for you to be comfortable. \xa0Because comfortable is, we want everyone to be comfortable. \xa0So I don\'t think that my particular time, any individual time, is really a noticeable tax - a noticeable reduction..although it is a reduction and at some point, we have to recognize that one ... We don\'t really do any of the little things. \xa0Right? And I shouldn\'t say that. That\'s probably not the best way to say it. \xa0What\'s the big deal if I just get a plastic water bottle right now.? Or a plastic bag because I forgot. Any one single decision by itself is very small. It\'s just that collectively we\'re making those decisions all the time, so it\'s very large. So it\'s just, it both doesn\'t matter at all and yet it is also the only step to spot. Right? It\'s the only way things get better is by the accumulation of many teeny tiny stops. \xa0So you know, we all, many of us are trying to reduce our plastic intake but if you get to some place and you forgot your water bottle and you\'re really thirsty or you want the chai with the thing, you\'re just gonna buy it because you just want it. So that goes back to our preference. So I tried for a week. There was ""No Plastic July"". And there\'s a woman here who will absolutely not. Meaning she will go without if she can\'t get it without plastic. \xa0And I just realized that I\'m going to have to start going without or taking more responsibility ahead of time to actually change my habit.

You know? And really you could say that there\'s larger things that they\'re learning to do now that were acquired over years. I just don\'t have the sensitivity to see all the tiny steps.

I just started asking myself ""What\'s one small thing I can change?"" \xa0I started making small changes but when I look back at everything I\'ve changed it starts to look like kind of a big deal. I started fishing. We usually buy our fish at Costco but I increasingly started to question the decision to buy fish shipped from Norway and all corners of the earth when I live right on the ocean with a treasure trove of local fish right out my front door. As I followed Katy around the podcast-sphere I ran into Daniel Vitalis and with his encouragement I went and bought a fishing license, got a pole and gear for Christmas and before you know it I had brought home dinner. Don\'t get me wrong. I am not some amazing fisherwoman who could sustain her family on fish alone. In the last 9 months, I\'ve brought home 5 dinners from the shore and several more when we chartered a boat. And I get skunked A LOT.

So that's exactly what I did.\xa0 Find the article and actually read that and see how it matches to The Washington Post article."", ""KATY: And we talked about this before. It's very hard to find the original research articles."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes. Absolutely.', ""KATY:\xa0 Because for some reason many journalists fail to include them.\xa0 And even now in today's hyperlinking society where a link is such a simple thing and all articles are linked but usually to a publication's other writings about it. There is a big resistance, and I'm not sure why, to linking to the source of the study that is in discussion. There are very few publications that link. And it's not only that they don't link. They don't put the title. They'll put something like, they'll put the journal-title and the researcher's name in interview style. But nothing else. So you're just left google scholaring keywords. That's what I do. I use keywords and the journal-title. So I'm trying to think of if we could create a list of steps. So my first step is to try to find before I even really process the story about the article, is I immediately go get the article through googling. What about you?"", ""JEANNETTE: Yes. Absolutely. I've also, I should say, have been really frustrated about this and I don't know why it happens. It's almost, I don't know, I'm maybe casting dispersions but people are maybe reading someone else's article and haven't even read the original article they just maybe Washington Post is the first and then everybody else. I mean then the article is then among a slew of articles and I wonder how many journalists actually looked at the original article. But what I find most often is the most fruitful is to find the researcher on their page on their university."", 'KATY: Hmmm.', ""JEANNETTE: So if you usually, it will say in the article somewhere something like Dr. Smith from the University of Oxford or whatever. So you can google that and maybe something about their field of research, especially if it's a common name. And you find their personal page on the University website and often it lists recent publications. Or if that fails it would be to put their name and a few keywords into something like PubMed or Google Scholar, which will usually bring out what you want. But sometimes it takes you a few times to get it. Horns, if you put horns, you wouldn't - and the researchers name you wouldn't get that on google scholar. It's finding the right words."", ""KATY: It's because they didn't use the word horns in their research."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.\xa0 Horns have nothing to do with bones because horns are made of keratin.', 'KATY: Right. And I think that that\'s a very good point. I would say I have a different experience because I am often used as an expert for media articles. And I know that many times people coming to ask me on comments of studies or other things, I\'ll say, ""I can\'t comment without the study. Could you send it to me?"" And they won\'t have the study. In many cases what they have is a press release on a study ...', 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: ... which is already simplified and then everyone is trying to kick out a story really quick so they can be timely on it. But it's not, but it's more reporting on the publicity of the piece, not necessarily the piece itself. So I think that's probably key to what's happening in the overall reporting as it's very challenging. Still, I would imagine that most press releases have the name of the actual publication. Just put that in, journalists listening to this."", 'JEANNETTE: I cannot imagine their press release would not have the paper.', ""KATY: Although sometimes they're embargoed. I do find that sometimes press releases come when papers are still not out yet, which is an interesting phenomenon itself."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: We could talk about science reporting a lot, but I want to talk more about the mechanics and about the biology. Because I think that we'll just do two shows. Are you in? We'll just do two or three shows. We'll keep going."", ""JEANNETTE: Oh yeah. Two shows would be good. There's a lot of meat."", ""KATY: There's a lot of meat."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', 'KATY: So, I wanted to sort out some of the language first. I kind of would like to start with that first.', 'JEANNETTE: Sure.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', 'KATY:\xa0 But anyway. Researchers use exostosis. Exostosis is the formation of additional bone from the surface of an existing bone. Exostoses are benign, meaning they’re not like a tumor - but benign, because if you look up that word it\'ll say ""benign bone growth"".\xa0 But Exostoses are not benign in the fact that they\'re not problematic. They\'re just not malignant. They can still be symptomatic. And you are probably, listeners, already familiar with the phenomenon of exostosis. Because another word often used for exostoses are bone spurs. And one example of common exostoses would be bunions.\xa0 So if that helps get a framework around what maybe some of the research is saying or what that paper was saying.\xa0', ""Now you have muscles all over your body and these muscles need to attach to something so they can generate leverage. If you’ve ever seen a skeleton - live or even a model or even a picture, I think - you can see that the skeleton itself isn’t really smooth. There are bumps on your bones. They're tiny areas that stick out a bit. These tiny mountains of bone are usually what a muscles’ tendon will attach to. And they are called in anatomy protuberances or eminences. There might be another term too. And I'm not actually certain on the difference between a protuberance or an eminence. It might be the size of it where it gets classified differently."", ""But anyway, this is important in the HORNS discussion because the paper wasn’t explaining a new bone. I mean it certainly wasn't explaining a horn. But it wasn't explaining a new bone. Rather, the authors were discussing about an increase in length of a protuberance. Something that all skulls already have because it's where you have ligaments and muscles attaching to. And the protuberance they were discussing was the external occipital protuberance. So, external means that it’s on the outside, of the skull, in this case. Occipital is one of the bones of the skull Your skull has got 22 bones including the bones of the face, and there's some variation. But let's say 22 bones. And the occipital bone is the bone in the lower back of the skull, just above your neck. And protuberance just means a part that sticks out.\xa0 So external occipital protuberance. It's this tiny little lump on the back of your skull where it provides a connection point so the parts that are attached to it can generate leverage to support your head or move your head as needed.\xa0"", ""The paper is describing exostosis of a bony protuberance, and (anatomy is so great!) excessive growth of a protuberance actually has its own name (of course it does). And it is, I don't even know if I'm going to say it right. Jeannette, you can weigh in. It's enthesophytes.\xa0 I think."", ""JEANNETTE: That's how I would pronounce it."", 'KATY:\xa0 Yeah.', 'JEANNETTE: I actually found this a difficult read because of that word that they used way more than they did exostosis. Without defining it.', ""KATY: That's right. And that's another issue with reading papers that are outside of your field."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: Because if I'm gonna read a paper, even in biology,\xa0 I feel like I'm having to - Like, I use every field, you say, they coop terms from each other.\xa0 There's only so many language terms. And when you're trying to describe a phenomenon you're reaching into the same pot of language. Sometimes you create new words. Sometimes you put a bunch of Latin words together to describe a phenomenon. So they don't always mean the same thing. But they want to clarify because some bone spurs happen on smooth bone. And that has its own name. I feel like I could be googling a lot of language. They have their own name and I feel like it's like an enso... do you know what it is?"", 'JEANNETTE: I was actually very confused by what, by this fact that they were talking about enthesophytes but the abstract in the title had exostosis.', 'KATY: Right.', 'JEANNETTE: And what I discovered, again by googling, these are definitions that I found that the enthesophyte was an abnormal bony projection at the site of the attachment of a tendon or a ligament. And then osteophyte was an abnormal bony projection in the joint space.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'JEANNETTE: So my interpretation was that exostosis was the general term.', 'KATY:\xa0 Right.', 'JEANNETTE: But the specific terms were enthesophyte and osteophyte. Does that make sense?', ""KATY: Yeah. So osteophyte is the other term I'm looking for. So exostosis is, to me is the growth of it."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', 'KATY: And the sub-classification of an enthesophyte or an osteophyte is more the location of that growth.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. That was exactly my interpretation.', ""KATY: And I think that the reason they have a different language is ... Levers aren't - they're not equal in length. I mean nothing is equal when you consider ... equal is not the right word. They're not exactly the same shape because your bones are being created by you as you move around. And so people who move in different ways would need different lever lengths. Or lever lengths are all different. And I think of bony protuberances as levers. They are shorter than the long levers of, let's say, the humorous or the femur. But mechanically speaking their function is the same. They're there for leverage to generate torque. And so I think it's helpful to have when you're measuring something that is bearing greater torque than say the surface of two bones that there would be a variance of it. So the fact that there are two terms makes sense to me. I think that bone spurs are probably more osteophytes. The way people are used to thinking about it - your problematic bone spur would be an osteophyte. But I would not say that a ... I mean what is a bunion? Is a bunion then an osteophyte?\xa0 Probably."", ""JEANNETTE: That's a good question."", ""KATY: Yeah. But I don't know. And the thing about exostosis is, there's a mechanical process to exostosis. It doesn't mean that it's the only way that it can come about."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: But the easy way that I explain it is when you have things pull on your body quite a lot the excessive pull - and excessive is relative - but let's say that more than the load that you create regularly through repetitive movements. It needs to, the tissues involved in those motions need to beef themselves up so to speak. They have to diffuse the load better. So, they can do that by changing shape a little bit. And then there's also maybe some protective features. There's maybe not only one feature - not only one problem that exostosis solves but in general the understanding of it is you're mechanically loading it so much that it has to change its shape to deal with the burden. And the paper was measuring 1200 skulls and saying this lever is longer but it wasn't only that it's longer. So the lever length seems to change in people with age."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: Well ok. I thought the paper was interesting.\xa0 I think it's biggest letdown was its results. So I read the introduction. It had some good premise. It had a good premise. And then I got to the results section and it didn't seem to add up.\xa0 It has a very very short results section. So in a scientific paper, there's always a wordy description of the results and then there's always some figures. Or there's almost always some figures.\xa0 And if you actually look at the results and their conclusions from those results, it doesn't add up. And the figures don't match the word results."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: So, I think there's a really big issue with that and I imagine Scientific Reports which is the journal it was published in, has been in contact with the authors to get a correction done. And it will be very interesting to see what comes out in terms of a correction. So, what happens if something comes to light or is incorrect or doesn't make sense then a journal or authors can publish what they call a correction. Now I haven't seen that come out yet. So it will be interesting to see what comes out. Because one of their biggest conclusions was that males were 5.48 times more likely to have what they called an excessive protuberance than females. But that's not borne out in their figure 4, which if anyone actually looks to the figure, it doesn't matter if you do or you don't. But they actually look, males and females look very similar. So, and I think the figure is probably wrong. Because it seems to be as a general rule it seems that these protuberances are larger in men in general. And I think that they're actually used sometimes in anthropological studies to differentiate skulls between male and female."", ""KATY: That's right. That's right."", 'JEANNETTE: So it would seem to me that they probably just made a mistake in their figure. But it does, obviously, mean that it\'s very hard to draw conclusions when one of their main figures is incorrect. And I kept rereading it thinking ""what am I missing?""\xa0 And then realized I wasn\'t missing something. It was just obviously an error. So that was a big thing for me. There were also some suggestions in it which seemed almost too small to be relevant, really. I don\'t know if you saw that, Katy, where they talk about, this is particularly in relation to forward head. So in the paper, we haven\'t mentioned this yet, but they were basically doing some analysis which showed that one of the main determinates in having what they called excessive protuberance was being male and the second thing that had a significant effect was the degree of forward head position.\xa0 Katy, you might be better to explain that phenomenon than me but it\'s essentially what we think of as that forward head of forward of the shoulders position. And they were trying - they were suggesting that that was significant in predicting whether you have one of these protuberances or not. But the relationship seemed very small. And to me would seem almost insignificant. But they claim it\'s significant. So I would have loved to have seen a raw data - like a data table.', ""KATY: Right. And that was one criticism. They didn't include any data tables."", ""JEANNETTE:\xa0 No. So it was really hard to really know whether their data is valid. And it will be very interesting to see what comes out in the correction. Because I think some of it was just a mistake. That was a real concern. And that's something that I, going back to our original topic of how you would read a scientific paper, it would be quite thorough reading of the results and looking at the figures and looking at the conclusions and seeing if it makes sense. And that can be quite hard to do sometimes."", ""KATY: Yeah. Do you think it's practical for folks to learn how to read scientific papers without - I mean it's not really."", ""JEANNETTE: No. No. I actually don't. I think it's... I mean this paper is not ... I mean it's easy for me to read the results section because I have enough experience in statistics and data presentation, but I found some of the language challenging because it's not my field of expertise. So I had to do a bit of digging around. But I think someone with no background in science, it's nigh on impossible. Because articles are written - scientific articles are written they say for peers. So what that means is you are writing assuming that the person reading your paper has a similar background to you."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: So if you are a molecular biologist you write in a language that another molecular biologist would understand without much elaboration. And it's the same with this paper. It would have been written for other chiropractors, maybe other anthropologists, or biomechanists. That kind of maybe physiotherapist. But it's not written for people to be able to really understand without a significant amount of background. And I think that's a problem with how science and research are actually conveyed to the general public because often they're of great interest to the general public but that's not transmitted in a very effective way. And that's probably another topic for another day."", ""KATY: Yeah. So it's - I can keep talking about this paper from the mechanical, as you said, it's been identified for, I would say for a while that there's a variation in shape of these protuberances.\xa0 So I think the fact that there was a variance in shape of the protuberances like my personal interest is in how we process information about movement. Not only how we move but I spend so much time studying movement, at this point, I'm probably more interested in studying sedentarism."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: Because I feel like if you approach the movement phenomenon - we're more sedentary than we move so, therefore, it seems to me that the phenomenon of sedentarism needs to be investigated more thoroughly. So I feel like that's kind of where I've taken my study of movement to - to start to look at why are we so sedentary. What are the mechanics of a sedentary person besides just not moving? But then what are all the things that come into that. And then it goes up to the cultural level which would just be large groups of people not moving. And how do when we have this dual role of kind of a group of people moving towards the scientific process as a way of knowing and understanding the world, it still doesn't help us really make decisions in a particular way. It helps us maybe know some of the facts. But we don't necessarily move more because a study has come out showing that we should. You know what I mean?"", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: It's not the only compass for behavior if you will. But I was interested in how it seemed like all of the reporting of this paper seemed to be more with the intent to dismiss it as a whole, full stop versus what we're doing now which is what I do when I read anything - which is to pull it up and to take the pieces of it that are clear and sometimes that is only the data that's gathered. Which in this case wasn't fully included in the study. And then you can see what the flaws are and then read the criticisms. That's another one of our steps, hey?"", 'JEANNETTE: Absolutely. Yeah.', ""KATY: let's say that reading the paper - you can go read the paper. And I would say that oftentimes this is the problem with paywalls, is you can't actually access the paper."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: In many cases. So your ability, even if you could read the data through your training, you'd have to pay $30 or $50 to be able to see it."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: And like, who cares. There's so much going on to read about and you're not making any money by doing it."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: So paywall, and the fact that science does influence - understanding influences our lives - but that it's not accessible for everyone to have the ability to process it. That's an issue. But let's say that you pay for the paper. How do you pull out the things that you need to mull on? Or how does someone reading this shape the next research better? And I feel like this - this is their second paper on this. Is this right?"", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. It is. They have got, which I think was an earlier paper, and it was just on the young. Just the young people.', 'KATY: Right. And I think one of the criticisms of that early paper ... if you don\'t know, papers are just, they\'re like one tiny piece and you\'re collecting lots of pieces together and you do a paper and then people criticize it. And criticism I don\'t only mean in a negative way. If you pull out the issues with it. And I believe this was their second attempt to meet some of those earlier criticisms which is ""Well you didn\'t look at a larger group to compare.""\xa0 So then right, they did this. And then there will be more criticisms and they will likely go back next time. And one of the criticisms of this paper was the entire population was from one chiropractic clinic. Meaning that every person who had - every person who was measured had been seeking treatment. So that\'s a particular filter, right? That\'s not necessarily the general population. And that was one criticism I would say from the media on this paper - these are people who are all, let\'s say generally, they all have neck pains. So it could just be that people with neck pain have larger protuberances and that\'s why they\'re there. Although in the paper itself they were saying that they, people go to chiropractors for various things. I think that this was a large database of existing imagery that could just be reviewed.', ""JEANNETTE: Yeah, I think it was - they hadn't necessarily gone for neck pain."", 'KATY: No.', 'JEANNETTE: So it could have been they were in the chiropractic practice but they could have gone for something to do with their foot.', ""KATY: And they eliminated people who specifically had cervical issues. So it's just sometimes if you read a piece that's intending to dismiss it and it's well they were all from a chiropractic clinic and the authors didn't think about that if you actually read the paper they did.\xa0 They did note it. And they did the best with their population. And a lot of the criticism, this is kind of going on what I noticed a lot was there was a lot of scientific criticism about horns."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: But the paper didn't include horns."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: And the researchers never used the word horns and so a lot of people were criticizing The Washington Post article as if it were the research article. And if you are a layperson and you're reading this and you don't know that horns wasn't the theory or part of the presentation of the paper, then it's easy for you to just dismiss what's going on in this piece full stop because. I keep saying full stop because I'm talking to you."", ""JEANNETTE: You can carry on. I don't think anyone will mind."", 'KATY: Ok, thank you. You know to me it was a little bit confusing. What are you talking about? Are you trying to take the paper bullet by bullet or are you taking the Washington Post article which, as you said earlier, might have been the main source of information for the journalists writing subsequent articles?', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. Absolutely.', 'KATY: Which is a problem.', 'JEANNETTE: It is a problem. I have two points. One is about what you were mentioning earlier about limitations about the study due to their sample size, etc. And I think it\'s not a helpful criticism. They\'re actually reporting something that they presumably observed in their population and thought it was interesting enough to actually study further. And that\'s how science works. You have a little bit of information and you build on it. And I would hope that lots of people would take this study now, because it has produced an awful lot of interest, and actually say, ""Right well we have huge numbers of both fossil remains of skulls and we have collections from various hospitals"" and you could start doing much bigger studies to see if this is actually more of a general phenomenon. And the other thing that I saw in a lot of the criticisms which is a fair criticism to an extent in that you can\'t say anything about handheld devices because you know nothing about the population of the people that you studied and their habits. Which is true. But the authors at no stage stated that this was definitively ... this was a suggestion on their behalf. So I think again, it\'s a fair criticism in that you can\'t determine if there\'s increase in the size of the protuberance is generally occurring in younger people, you can\'t relate it to handheld devices because you have no idea of what the handheld device usage is of your particular population. So that would be a different study. But I think it was a little unfair because they were suggesting a possibility. They weren\'t actually stating it as fact.', 'KATY: I think they were trying to make it relevant.', 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', 'KATY: I feel like that was the intention. And again, if you go back to the headline of the Washington Post, you know it says, ""phone use is to blame"" research suggests.', 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: And I guess you could say that there was a suggestion of a mechanism, but I don't - again we're just focusing on the article. But I like that they wrote down some of the forward head activities: The head is in front of the body for a lot of things, driving and cycling and all these pieces."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeh.', ""KATY; But this is a possible explanation for why we would see a phenomenon that has been observed medically in older people now in younger people. So the understanding of where they come from, these protuberances, changes in size, may need updating. I didn't take any issue with that because I feel like I probably would have done things a little bit differently just because of my mechanical background which is different from a chiropractor."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: I would consider loads more. But that's how everyone feels about every paper. You look at it from your field. And so now maybe some biomechanists can take this paper and then maybe you'll see anthropologists take this paper and build on understanding from it. That's the way it works. That's what these papers are for. We're a large group of people with different observations within populations and then you're sharing them and then you're developing them."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: So, let's switch to what do you think ... horns, I feel like horns was very clickbaity. I feel like horns tend to go - they tend to just pull up visions of demons."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', 'KATY: You know what I mean? The demonizing of handheld devices or technology or ""Look, now we have horns."" I\'m not even sure it was not on purpose that it was done that way. But there was a huge reaction. A big reaction to this idea that this idea that technology would be harmful to us. And a lot of pieces that I read were moral pieces. This is just another paper trying to make the fact that we use technology so much - a moral issue. Look we\'re ruining our kids. They have horns now. Instead of just trying to take the emotion out of it just to say, ""Hey are there changes to our skeleton in some particular way."" So I liked the criticisms where they were more here\'s the problems but the phenomenon is definitely worthy to look at even further.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', 'KATY: My big thing is, I didn\'t want this for people who only read the headlines to go, ""Well that was debunked, right?""\xa0 I hear people say that all the time. ""They debunked that."" And it\'s like, No that\'s like a battle of the media clickbaity things and then it just falls away. The interest in the phenomenon because it\'s just this emotional roller coaster. I felt like this was really important to those who are interested in the impacts of movement, posture, positioning, alignment, culture. I thought it was worth a discussion because I think it\'s very interesting and totally relevant. What I saw though was this idea that now our future generations are gonna have horns. You know what I mean?\xa0 That we are evolving. Or I think I saw a picture, you know the typical picture of someone coming out and growing out and at a computer and a horn, now the horns are on the end.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: As I was talking about it with other folks - this idea of morphology. Morphology - the study of shape and what shapes us. I love morphology. I've always said that your skeleton is - it's an autobiography of sorts. Because you're writing it. But it doesn't necessarily mean that things are handed down. So I just thought it would be a really cool place to talk about why this is not that case."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: How do we talk about morphology and culture. What are genetic changes? Adaptations? Evolution? Let's talk about some of the selection process so, what do you want to start with?"", ""JEANNETTE: Ok. So these are really complex and big topics. I'm gonna try and I think we should go step by step."", 'KATY: Always.', 'JEANNETTE: And define things so that people can try and easily separate them out. And it can be challenging. Evolutionary biology is probably one of the hardest literatures to get into. So I think we should start with defining evolution.\xa0 Natural selection. What different people mean by adaptation.

And plasticity."", ""JEANNETTE: Plasticity would be good. So we'll define all those..."", 'KATY: Ok.', ""JEANNETTE: ... so if you ever do want to look at papers you will have a clear idea of what biologists mean when they say certain things and also just to see how different the mechanisms are within an organism's lifetime versus when we're talking about evolution and passing things on."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""JEANNETTE: So I have a lot of words at this stage. So I think, Katy, if you want to interrupt me at any point with a question or something that doesn't make sense, please feel free before I go on a horrible monologue."", 'KATY: Right. And I think I will interrupt with this idea of what would a listener - what would their question potentially be.', 'KATY: It does for me. Everyone out there?', 'JEANNETTE: Hopefully!', 'KATY: It would be so nice if we could do Romper Room style.\xa0', 'JEANNETTE: I know. Hands up!', 'KATY: Is that good?', ""JEANNETTE: So that's evolution. So when we talk about selection - this gets a little bit more complicated. So I should say one thing first; evolutionary changes can occur both by what we term selection but also by something, by chance. And that's something that people don't often realize. So the term that evolutionary biologists use is genetic drift. So evolutionary changes can occur just by chance through this process of genetic drift. And I say that not to confuse matters further, but just so that you might see that term, and we often don't realize that some changes just come about through no selective forces at all. It's just random chance. So it would be - I'll give you an example. Again, if you have 10 red ants and 10 black ants, very tiny population. And one day a deer runs through a forest and it stands on them and it stands on 7 red and 3 black. The population would be then skewed toward black ants. Not through any difference in their biological function but just because it was dumb luck. So a lot of changes that we see are not necessarily selective. So that's just to put that aside.\xa0"", ""KATY: And then, let me just pop in here. So dumb luck, I'm trying to think of examples of dumb luck. I love your deer example. So just like natural catastrophes. Are those dumb luck."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. And those effects are much greater obviously the smaller the population. So human beings would have, back in the day, when we lived in small tribes, had pretty small populations.', 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: So there could be a natural disaster and it's just chance.\xa0"", 'KATY: It just left everyone who had one thing.', ""JEANNETTE: And I think people forget that that's sometimes there's no rhyme or reason. It's just a sampling error if you're a mathematician."", ""KATY: Right. It's hard not to attribute purpose to everything. It's really challenging."", ""JEANNETTE: It is.\xa0 Which is really interesting because often people think natural selection is purposeful. But it's not. It's really mathematical. It's not purposeful."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: I'll try to explain that next. So natural selection, this is of Charles Darwin fame. So individuals with heritable traits - so that means characteristics that can be passed on. So individuals with heritable traits that favor survival and reproduction will tend to leave more offspring than others without those traits, causing those heritable traits to increase in frequency over generations. Again, that sounds like a bit of a mouthful. But if you go back to my example with the hemoglobin, there's something which everybody has probably heard of which is sickle cell anemia. Now sickle cell anemia can have some quite serious consequences. Your red blood cells, there's a very simple genetic change which results in a change in the structure of the hemoglobin molecule. And what it means is your red blood cells become sickle-shaped.\xa0 They are actually more apt to burst. They're very fragile. So anemia can result along with other things. But, like I said, they also confer resistance to malaria. So in populations with high malaria, those traits would have resulted in increased survival and reproduction. So they tended to leave people with that mutation or that genetic change had more offspring and over a period of many generations, those characteristics increased in the population."", ""KATY: I'm just going to restate it a little bit more simply.\xa0 A sickle shape to a cell is an asset in areas with malaria."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: So because it's an asset, if you had the non-sickle shape, you would have more people not surviving malaria."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', 'KATY: And so those with the non-sickle shape would die off or not make more people.', 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY:\xa0 And then so what you do, is you end up over time having people with the sickle shape being successful in that environment, having more babies who have the sickle shape, they're more successful. And then over time what happens is you have entire populations that share a particular trait because that trait works well in that environment.\xa0 It's not an optimal trait. It's always relative for an environment."", ""JEANNETTE:\xa0 That's right."", 'KATY: I just wanted to restate it simply.', 'JEANNETTE: That was way clearer than my definition.', ""KATY: I like both. I like both. I think there's just different types of - there's people listening with different backgrounds and..."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah, and I'm sorry I always talk as a biologist."", ""KATY: You should. You're a biologist."", ""JEANNETTE: It's something that I cannot get away from. That was great. That's exactly what I was trying to say in much harder words. But also, as a good example, when we look at that trait in an area without malaria, there's no benefit to it. It's actually costly. So that trait probably occurred in other populations around the world but essentially there was a negative selection when that happened. Because natural selection would favor its removal from the population when malaria is not present."", 'KATY: Right. So that would be a drift?', ""JEANNETTE:\xa0 No. That's still selection."", ""KATY: I mean the fact that there's a randomness to sickle cell's coming on."", ""JEANNETTE: Ok, so no it's not drift. I'll explain what it is."", ""KATY: So let me just sum up the part that is... I'm just kind of checking my own.\xa0 So someone else for a reason you're about to explain, had sickle-shaped cells in an area without malaria. They wouldn't necessarily survive better. In fact, it would be more of a liability."", 'JEANNETTE: It would be the opposite, yes.', 'KATY: It would be the opposite so you would find people with a non-sickle cell reproducing more and you would see fewer and fewer sickle-shaped cells in folks and then you just end up in a population that has very little of that occurring.', ""JEANNETTE: Exactly. Your question relates to the mechanism of change.\xa0 So for natural selection to work, it has to select something. So there has to be a variation in a trait. So in this case, some people have sickle cell red blood cells and some don't. And that occurred because there was a mutation."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE: At some point. In somebody or in several people there was a mutation. And mutation is a change in the genetic code. And it can be for a number of reasons that not everything is perfect in biology and mistakes happen. It's essentially a mistake that happens in the copying of DNA. And that change occurred presumably in one or more individuals. And then over many of hundreds or thousands of generations, the selection in the malaria areas happened.\xa0 And conversely, if one of those mutations happened in a population without malaria, it would stay very low or be removed entirely because it has a negative effect."", 'KATY: This is a question that just pops up. Why is sickle cell shaped a mutation and not the non-sickle cell?', ""JEANNETTE: We're getting philosophical, I feel."", 'KATY: Is that what it is?', ""JEANNETTE: Who knows. Well, actually they probably do know. I don't know. But there would have been an ancestral, what they call an ancestral hemoglobin shared way back. Mammalian lineages all have hemoglobin. So what the ancestral hemoglobin looked like, I don't know. But there would have been mutations through, you know that hemoglobin that we've got today is probably started back in the third generation of homosapiens.\xa0 So what is mutation? They're all - you know, we're the result of millions of mutations."", ""KATY: So it's relative."", 'JEANNETTE: I think we always look at mutations as being a bad thing.', ""KATY: Sure. And it's not. Well, the word implies..."", ""JEANNETTE: It's both. It can be positive. It can be negative. It can be completely indifferent."", ""KATY: You've got horns on your red blood cell."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', 'KATY: I was just thinking that malaria, jungle areas, would have been where we mostly came from.', 'JEANNETTE: Um. Well...', ""KATY; And that's just a very shallow assessment out of the top of my head."", 'JEANNETTE: I think - if you look at Savanna. The hypothesis, these changes all the time. But a Savanna origin, which is actually quite dry.', 'KATY: Ok. Ok.\xa0 All right.', ""JEANNETTE: If you're looking at West Africa it's very very wet. And so actually I would say that we probably didn't. I mean, I'm guessing here, but Savanna is probably dryer. Probably not so malaria rife."", 'KATY: I guess I was thinking more like, you know how when they talk about mathematically speaking the way that bees shape their cells optimizes, optimizes the volume.', 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: This is a terrible, off the top of my head, me making stuff up. So let's say that there is a mutation and for some reason, you have bees that shape their cells differently. What would make one survive more than the other is simply volume of food, right?"", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: Or do what we consider to be - I mean I would assume that as bees are turning into bees from whatever else they evolved from there might have been lots of different shapes of honey storage or do you think that full volume was always the first piece. Or if the shape evolved to be that and that's what's perpetuation. The way I'm thinking about it is, is there something about the non-sickled hemoglobin shape that maximizes oxygen transport."", 'JEANNETTE: Right.', ""KATY: So I'm thinking about it as a mathematical shape thing where we would consider the mutation one that carried and let's say does its job as a red blood cell with less volume and that's why it's considered a mutation. Even though it's an asset."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah.Maybe. I think probably people have actually done these studies and I don't know them. And they've looked. I mean it's certainly almost everywhere else there is no sickle cell anemia. Apart from now obviously we have more migration which actually is interesting because that can change things too, right? That the ancestral form was a donut-shaped red blood cell and that shape has various benefits. Volume. Maybe also smooth movement of the blood through the vessels."", 'KATY: Right right.', ""JEANNETTE: Less blockage. Because I know sickle cell can result in blockage. So I think there are lots of things that would mean that anything that changes the donut-shaped blood cell would be a negative thing and people talk about it as a mutation because it's something that has arisen more recently in the human lineage. But I still don't think they refer to mutation because it's negative. It's just important to consider. It's just a time thing rather than the fact that it's a negative thing. Because plenty of mutations have obviously resulted in very positive effects."", ""KATY: That's right.\xa0 I think it's more like, for this idea of alignment, there's this idea of a shape optimizing. But that's also in the context of the environment in which you're in. And I'm thinking of things much larger than this show right now. But it's important for me to always reconcile the different pieces. So there are mutations and the mutations are beneficial. Just as there are different shapes to skeletons and they pay off in some places and they don't pay off in other places. And it's all context-driven. It really is all context-driven."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. Absolutely.', 'KATY: Sorry for that sidebar.', 'JEANNETTE: No. It was helpful, I think.', 'KATY: Hopefully. Raise your hands, everyone. Was it helpful?', ""JEANNETTE: Again, raise your hands.\xa0 Ok, so we have, we've done evolution and natural selection. And I think another point that I want to make about evolution and I think this is quite relevant to the paper that we're discussing about the morphological change is that evolutionary changes tend to be slow. So it takes hundreds if not thousands of generations from a change, sorry a mutation, to go from low frequency to high frequency in a population.\xa0 Even with strong selection for it. Because you - stay you start with a population of a thousand people and one person has a change, has a mutation. Obviously, you've got the other 999 still having babies, etc. So it takes, even with a strong selective advantage in that..."", ""KATY: There's still only one of you."", ""JEANNETTE: There's still only one of you. So when you're talking about population changes takes a long time. So that's one important point. So now, I'm gonna talk about the word adaptation. Which I think is very challenging. Because it's, like we were saying earlier, there are words. It's an old word. It's been around hundreds of years. And it's been co-opted by biologists in different ways. I would say that all biologists really use it to mean a process by which a species becomes fitted to its environment.\xa0 But an evolutionary biologist would probably use it quite differently to maybe a physiologist. And this is when things become messy. So an evolutionary biologist would often imply by that term genetic adaptation."", 'KATY: Right.', ""KATY: No. It sounds great. We're gonna get it on hats and you should sell them on your website. Phenotypic plasticity."", ""JEANNETTE: So phenotypic plasticity essentially means the ability for an organism to express different characteristics depending on the environment. And that doesn't necessarily have to be positive in this case. So a great example is amphibious plants. It's quite an extreme example. So you have amphibious plants that grow partly in water and partly out of water. They have the same genetic information across the whole plant, obviously. It's one plant. But they have different leaves below the water and different leaves above the water. So it's basically they're able to have a completely different phenotype. So phenotype is the observable characteristics of an organism. So if someone just took a picture of the top of the plant, and showed someone a picture of the bottom of the plant, they would look like two different plants, but they're the same. So plants tend to be much more plastic - more flexible. So all of this might be a bit complicated."", 'KATY: Well let me just ask a question first.\xa0\xa0', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: If I have one arm in a cast for let's give the extreme 3 months. And my left arm and I'm vigorously working out my right arm and I showed you my two arms are there phenotypes different?"", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: Ok. That's just to ground it in what we're talking about. So I can have different phenotypes of arms on my body. And I can also have the before picture and an after picture of my entire body and there will be change in my phenotype, let's say if I started running or whatever."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah. Absolutely. Muscle. And that's where you see physiologists use adaptation a lot is muscle adaptation. And what they mean is it's not anything to do with genetics. It's just that every organism has a degree of flexibility to respond to change."", ""KATY:\xa0 It's your viewmaster for Move Your DNA."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. It is.\xa0', 'KATY: To go for a completely outdated 1980s reference that will be totally obsolete in 7 years from now.', 'JEANNETTE: It will.

And then there are lots of other proceedings from the Natural Academy of Sciences. Highly regarded journals. A lot of people read them. A lot of very clever people in different fields. And they will often write letters.

So lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose which is milk sugar. So back 20,000 years ago, whenever, when all human beings were all living hunter-gatherer lifestyles, all human begins pretty much lost the ability to digest lactose shortly after weening. So in childhood. And still today, probably the largest proportion of adult human beings still do not digest lactose - milk sugar. So then around 10,000 years ago in some areas, we start seeing animal domestication and dairy. And actually, it seems that people started to drink milk first before any type of adaptation happened.\xa0 So since that process, the culture changed. We went from populations that did not have domesticated milk-producing animals to having those. That was a cultural shift. And people started drinking that milk. And then in some, actually in different populations, there were slightly different mutations which enabled adults to continue to produce lactase and break down milk sugar. Because that was such a strong selective pressure because presumably there were loads of different benefits from drinking milk both in terms of growth, age to reproductive maturity, probably being able to ween your children much earlier, etc, etc. So that had a very strong effect on what's called your reproductive fitness. So we see that, and still, so that was a very strong selection pressure.\xa0 It still took almost probably 9000 years to become to the levels it is today. So now, in lots of parts of Europe, the middle east, people now buy and large are what's called lactose tolerant. They can, their lactase enzymes persist and they're able to digest the milk sugar. And we call people that can't lactose intolerant. And there were plenty of those too. But they're much rarer in the populations that have been dairy farming for a long time. So that's a very classic example of a cultural effect. A gene-culture interaction. So we created the selection pressure by starting to drink milk."", ""KATY: Yeah. I'm just nodding."", 'JEANNETTE: That was a sigh. That was a big sigh.', ""KATY: Well I think there's just this idea that nature, and I think culture is often put under the word nurture because nature/nurture sounds cute. It's like nature versus nurture is often the head to head battle. But it's really nature via nurture. And also nurture via nature. They're constantly informing each other."", 'JEANNETTE: Oscillating.', ""KATY: One shapes the other and that's why that's ..."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: ... that's the story."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah, absolutely. Even things like sexual selection is huge. And that's a - we all choose our partners perhaps in a much more culturally informed way.\xa0 You know what was attractive in your partner thousands of years ago might be different to what it is today. And that clearly has an effect on reproduction. So there's loads of things that, yeah, culture is huge in terms of it. And gene-culture interaction is a hot topic, I think, in evolutionary biology. Because really I think lots of people think it's a major driver."", ""KATY: It's very challenging to parse the two."", 'JEANNETTE:\xa0 Yes.', ""KATY: So yams. I sent a link in our last newsletter about the sickle cell anemia and yam farming. So we've already talked about the selection, the mutation of sickle cells, but why it worked, why it persisted, had a lot to do with the culture of the group in which it mutated. So do you want to talk about that?"", ""JEANNETTE: Yes. So I haven't read so much on this but basically, yam farming involves creating - well - standing pools of water results when you grow yams as I understand it. So you are basically creating environments for mosquitos to breed and flourish. So malaria rates presumably increased. So it was essentially the cultural activity of yam farming increasing the number of mosquitoes, which increases the likelihood of getting malaria. And then the trait followed along behind that cultural process.\xa0 So you saw the increased gene frequency or appearance of sickle cell anemia in those populations. And that was in Africa. And you also, interestingly, there is apparently something going on in Asia with tire production."", ""KATY: That's right."", ""JEANNETTE: So they're producing tires and I can't remember where it is in Asia.\xa0 So the tires create a ..."", 'KATY: Extra surface area.', 'JEANNETTE: Extra surface area that collect water and the mosquitoes can flourish there. It was interesting because, as you know Katy, I lived in Bermuda for a number of years. And Bermuda suffered quite a lot from yellow fever and dengue fever hundreds of years ago but you can be prosecuted by allowing standing bodies of stagnant water to persist.', ""KATY: Yeah. And when I went to New Zealand a couple of years ago when we were passing through Polynesia there were outbreaks of Dengue fever. So that's when I, of course, my research brain was like, why is there an increase. And there is a large association and it's also that we are in the United States and I'm not sure about other countries in North America too, shipping our used tires that we don't use any longer abroad."", ""JEANNETTE: So ok, it's fine for other people to kill themselves with bald tires."", ""KATY: Well they're less expensive and also where are you going to put them. And then what happens is they hold standing water. So very quickly the ubiquitousness of the residue of the car-centric culture ends up affecting mosquito breeding grounds and then you end up increasing mosquito-borne illnesses. And it's not a very big step to tie it back to what are other symptoms of our lack of being about to carry our bodies great distances. And it's like, how do you put in a mosquito based disease?\xa0 When you can see it so clearly from excessive standing water. But of course, you can see that with the understanding of the catalyst for sickle cells evolving into a group was also the decision to change or modify the environment largely. We're going to cut the forest down and we're going to grow things here. And that ends up changing and then of course changes who gets to survive there. And then you end up over time without realizing it, shaping populations. So I was talking about that at a permaculture retreat because it was blowing my mind. It's like I wouldn't have tied dengue fever to the car movement without just this understanding of they're really trying desperately to, as you said, educate people on how to store tires."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: But it's also if we'd also just drive less and don't use as many tires and go to public transportation you don't have such a huge waste. Because who thought of tires as being mosquito nurseries. But they are. And they are in the environments where rainwater accumulates. And it's so easy to say, well just drill holes in it. But what if they go to areas where everyone doesn't have power tools in their own personal garage. Which is the other flip side of that. But yea, that bothered me a lot when I read that.\xa0 But anyway, ok, so culture. Culture is definitely at play when it comes to our genetics although the scale is longer, for sure."", 'JEANNETTE: Right. Yeah.', 'KATY: Oh my gosh. Where to now?\xa0 We could just keep going.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah. I know. We could keep going.', 'KATY: So horns are not... I keep calling them horns...', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah, so there was no way that the horns or whatever else you want to call them are a genetic change.\xa0 You need hundreds, thousands, of generations to really see...', 'KATY: And it would have to be a benefit. The person with ...', 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: ... the person with the change would have to be more successful in a particular environment. But then I was thinking, well, I guess if the future is all tech-based with the person with the longer lever, you know, would the neck be able to withstand larger bouts of time. And that's to me that's the loop. We are really well suited for the chair. We are really really well suited for ..."", 'JEANNETTE:\xa0 Right.', ""KATY:\xa0 ... well, we don't know what it is. And also, one of my other points is, handheld devices is such a random thing. I mean you are looking at - this is my other critique of the paper - which is, this is the first generation, they measured 20 to 30-year-olds, this is the group. Or 18 to 30-year-olds. It's not just handheld devices. This is the first generation that's grown up completely on a computer."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: You know what I mean? I got my first home computer when I was probably 12. But it was such a small percentage of my life. I had two crap games. And most of them were just typing. And I never played them for more than an hour every couple of days because it was much more fun to go do other things. Everyone else was doing other things.\xa0 So everyone else was drawing you into a bunch of other things. So it's really recently that children have spent so much time on the computer and also not doing anything else. Not walking, not riding their bikes, so it's not only this idea of things in our hands. I think there's a lot of interesting ways that this research can be continued upon. Because these are new skeletal environments. But will it persist? I don't think so."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah. No. And the other thing is, and this is, again, maybe getting too complex. But when we go back to where this is what we would call phenotypic plasticity. Your skull is responding, this feature is a response to the environment.\xa0 Now there's a lot of debate that goes both ways but if phenotypic plasticity could constrain evolution and it could potentially accelerate it. So by that I mean if you already have the flexibility to deal with a situation it may constrain evolution because there won't be significant advantage to the person who mutates a, something that's constitutive. By constitutive I mean they always express this external protuberance. Because your body already has the capacity to do it if it needs to."", 'KATY: No.', 'JEANNETTE: So does that make sense?', ""KATY: I said no. So in my mind, I was building the example of, this is not something you're born with. Right? This is something that is increasing in length over time - over load applied over time."", 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: But your plasticity, your ability - sorry I'm just trying to talk myself through so you can see where I don't understand."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: So my ability, though, for it to grow longer, my plasticity, my phenotype plasticity, that's just what it is."", ""JEANNETTE: Exactly.\xa0 I think I haven't explained myself well. So we have that, assume, we have that plasticity. I know nothing about the genetic control of these exostoses and it seems to be from just the few bits that I've looked at through these papers that it seems to be early on in development everything - the bones and the joints and - are set."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JEANNETTE:\xa0 But what I'm saying is if you say just theoretically, that a mutation occurred in development - in a developmental process that meant that you had a larger protuberance at that point.\xa0"", ""KATY: That you came with the gene for an adult you're going to have the ten millimeter..."", ""JEANNETTE: Yep. Exactly.\xa0 Which is unlikely because often development is quite constrained. But in theory, if you had that you would really have no, say there was a selected advantage. In theory, something made you made this impact your reproductive fitness or your survival which again is a longshot but let's just say that was possible or occurred. You still have nothing over the person that had the flexibility to generate it by phenotypic plasticity. So there's no differential between you for selection to act on.\xa0 So that's why there's a theory that actually our flexibility or our ability to be phenotypically plastic can actually constrain genetic change for that reason."", ""KATY: Um-hmm. That's why we haven't changed that much. Because our plasticity range is quite large."", ""JEANNETTE: It's quite large. And yeah and lots of things like this are set by regulatory path gene pathways that are very unlikely to change because they're all interlinked and it gets very complex. But it's just - it seems the situation on so many levels that it would be unlikely that we would see any evolutionary change in that feature."", 'KATY: Right.', 'JEANNETTE: That was a very long way to say that.', ""KATY: No. I mean we've already talked so long, who cares now at this point. This is going to be the Joe Rogan 3-hour podcast that's what's going to happen now."", ""JEANNETTE: We're getting pretty close to the 2-hour mark now."", ""KATY: That's right.\xa0 Well, it's, you know I always feel bad because I always want to lead in with these things are complicated. Because I don't want anyone to feel badly when they don't grasp them quickly. Not that they're complicated. It's that they require years of hours of investing time to work up to gathering the pieces.\xa0 And that's what makes the ideas more accessible."", ""JEANNETTE: That's right."", ""KATY: Because of the time in years, in volume, that we've all dedicated to whatever the thing is. You know, some people can knit and I can't do that. And it's not that it's complex. It's so easy. And it's not easy. Because the hours that you've invested. So these things that we're talking about, I don't think are any more challenging to grasp. It's just that - what's a challenge is more, I would say, on my end or your end, to take something that we have understood in a particular way because of the years of hours of investment into a way to make them useful or relevant or helpful to you in a one hour show. That's what's challenging. But we're already at a two-hour show because that's what we had to do because of the years going into all of these things are a lot."", ""JEANNETTE: That's right. Yeah.\xa0 And it's hard to be succinct when there are so many interlinked phenomena."", ""KATY: It's hard to be succinct when every single word has to be defined.\xa0 That's all jargon is. Jargon is succinct terminology for those that chose to study the years to understand which each of those words mean. So, it's just that. So to go jargon-free - jargon exists because a lot of words represent concepts that take a lot of explanation. They take a lot of other words. Ok, you've got other words? The word we're gonna put on it is plasticity."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: You know what I mean? But it took all these other words. So I don't think jargon is meant to be not inclusive. It's just we all chose where to put our time. But also we have to function - we have outsourced understanding to different things to different folks. And so this is a way of how do we get some of it back.\xa0 Because maybe now we're willing to put in time to learn different things. And I appreciate your help in clarifying some of those terms. I think it'll make it, hopefully, a lot more clear for everyone."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah. Hopefully. And I think lots of people are interested in genetics and evolution. And evolutionary medicine and the evolutionary mismatch theory. And I think there's a lot of general interest in that. So having a little bit of understanding of the words that might be used is hopefully going to be helpful."", ""KATY: Oh I'm sure I could have you on five more times.\xa0 We'll just keep talking about things like this."", 'JEANNETTE: And just talk about stuff that we just talk about just to each other.', 'KATY: This could be so great.', 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: Human being, social issues. So I have lots of different hats that I wear. So without saying it has to be a biological takeaway or a technical takeaway, what's your takeaway?"", ""JEANNETTE:\xa0 My takeaway, I think, would be I had some issues with how the paper was written but I don't believe these guys - I think they just made some mistakes in how they present things. Or maybe not presented it in the best way. But I would definitely look at this and think habits have consequences.\xa0 And these guys are chiropractors that presumably seeing something quite interesting in their population. They might have something in it. So it would definitely be if it's true that we're seeing these things in younger and younger people, its something we should be aware of in terms of our habits. And I definitely, not just from this study, but from everything else that I have read think that extended periods of sedentary time, looking at a device has negative consequences. So, I think it's valid. I'd be really interested to see what comes out of it. But as a parent it's definitely - I do not want my children to spend hours in any position for any length of time really. But I also, as a parent, have that whole guilt concept of what do I do about it. And I think that's where your work comes in so well. But we have all the issues with schools, and screens and how to navigate that. Which is super challenging, I think for our generation and our kids."", 'KATY: Yeah.\xa0', ""JEANNETTE: So. Yeah. And that's the point when I put my head in my hands and I just want to sell my house and go buy a plot of land in the middle of nowhere and but yeah. I think that's my takeaway. It's worth taking these people seriously, I think."", 'KATY: Yeah.', 'JEANNETTE: And seeing what comes out. I think now there will be lots of follow up of this kind of thing and it will be interesting to see what comes out of it.', 'KATY: I think my takeaway is probably fairly similar. I can see some of the tendency to dismiss as ""these have always ranged in shape and don\'t worry about it."" And that is true. There\'s always - there are many documented ranges of shape. Of course, no one has correlated them to the weights of the heads. You know what I mean?', 'JEANNETTE: Right. Yeah.', 'KATY: It was very Move Your DNA as far as the orca fin goes. Male orcas have taller dorsal fins.', 'JEANNETTE: Yes.', ""KATY: They have bigger bodies overall. So my hypothesis would be that you see longer protuberances in heavier heads and probably males tend to have heavier heads. But you would see that there was a natural relationship between length and weight. Because that's what it's for. And also I think it's really important that none of the papers discuss that your trapezius muscles. It's not just the weight of your head, it's also the tension. So that's another piece and why ...their measures of posture were poor. And I also don't think that posture is the best thing here. I think load is the bigger thing to understand. Also, two-dimensional posture measures scientifically are very poor because of the way that it's done. But anyway, if we were to do something more about measuring trapezius EMG for example, that would give us greater understanding of just the amount, just the tensions that are on this bone. It's not only the weight of the head it's all these other things. But you could do little things like bend your knees to make the weight of your head less. So there's a lot of compensation things. But anyway, that's mechanical aside.\xa0 The other thing that would be concerning is that these are normal. Variance is normal. But it's kind of like a folded fin. There's a difference between seeing a few orcas with a little bend to their fin from a known accident or a known outlier and then seeing every single one who lives in a particular way with a folded fin. So you can put them under the sentence of going folded fin syndrome. We see it in the wild. We see it here. Ok, that's true. But what is the frequency and the distribution and the actual geometry? So that's what they're doing here so I pay attention to that."", ""JEANNETTE: Yeah. I think it would be really nice if they started to compare this data and other data sets for X-rays to fossil remains. And there's lots of collections of skulls which are presumably much easier actually to measure."", 'KATY: Actually measure.', ""JEANNETTE: And also they have populations which had very high load to the area. Like what's the term? Tumpline?\xa0 Tumpline. Where they have the men and women that carried things with a band around the forehead and then they carry them and there's a baby on the back. And I think those populations are very high load to the head and the neck where they're really using the neck and the back to help support the weight. I think that's where you see this as well. So it would be very interesting to see well we know that these populations have this very high load and then we compare to other populations who are weavers or I'm thinking of victorian Britain where they had people working at looms and for very long periods of time, whether those people also had these kinds of issues. To try and build up a bigger picture."", 'KATY: A bigger mechanical ...', 'JEANNETTE: A bigger mechanical picture. And I hope that this paper might actually bring those two fields together. People actually do some really big big studies.', 'KATY: There\'s so much out there. Some graduate study sees and hopefully... ""that\'s my thesis right there.""', 'JEANNETTE: Exactly.', ""KATY: But I also think that seeing something in children that you've only seen in adults is also an issue because you're setting bone - bone robusticity and bone density are interesting. I don't know if this would fall under plasticity. You kind of set limits when you're a child for your skeletal experience as an adult."", 'JEANNETTE: Right. Yeah.', ""KATY: And so and the people who do have larger protuberances, there's surgery for it. It is not symptom-free. So that was another thing that was expressed.\xa0 It's like we're seeing this thing that has known - whatever a shape - so what. Well, there's symptoms and surgeries associated with this shape and the fact that it's becoming more ubiquitous perhaps and at a younger age this would be predicting the experience for a group of people and then trying to figure out why. And I also think that with technology, whether this is technology. I mean weaving was technology at some point. And people figured it out and we've been trying to get away from it."", 'JEANNETTE: Yeah.', ""KATY: I'm very hopeful. When I think of smoking - if I look at TV movies from the 50s and the 40s and photos, everyone was smoking. They were smoking on TV. Doctors were smoking."", 'JEANNETTE: Oh yeah.', ""KATY: There were no good use practices around it. And technology has come on so quickly there are no good use practices around it. And I think that we're pretty good at recognizing an issue and then trying to put safety practices around it. Right? We've done it with... I've had this dream of doing this video, you know, just about the addictive nature of let's just say handheld. If you think of every time you picked up your phone. It's on the toilet. It's in your car. It's all these sites.\xa0 Imagine if you just had a flask and were taking a nip out of your flask."", ""JEANNETTE: Oh yeah, that's true!"", ""KATY: And taking a video of just like, drinking it.

I'm Katy Bowman, author of "", ' and a ', ' about moving. This podcast is about how movement works on a cellular level, how to change your position as you move, and why you might want to, and how movement works in the world, also known as movement ecology. All bodies are welcome. \xa0Are you ready to get moving?', 'Music', ""Ok. I like this question. Before I get into brands, I think that this is the more important piece. I, personally, transitioned to minimal shoes over years, so around four or five, to feel comfortable with, super minimal shoes when I was backpacking or when I am backpacking which is carrying 30-70 pounds long distance. Being a kid carrying family really helped because we were not only wearing minimal shoes, we were walking daily in them three to five miles while carrying them 20-30 pounds. So that's a significant amount of training. So you have to remember the ecology of it all. It's not just what you put on your feet, it's how you move in them. All of it. What you're walking upon. As well as, I was simultaneously doing lots of corrective exercises. So everything that I recommend in my books about transitioning to minimal shoes, I was also doing. So that's a lot more than just putting something on my feet. Even though you've been wearing minimal shoes, you do need to choose wisely for this trip because you're adding weight, adding distance, and adding new terrain that your feet are not used to. So you might actually want to step up in external support as the loads you're going to be introducing are much different than what your feet are used to. So you can hike in something that's moderately supportive but pack a minimal sandal for the rest of the time. It's not all hiking. When you're backpacking you're also, lots of times, you know, certainly setting up camp and then you're just walking around maybe as you're taking breaks. So you can have two pairs of shoes to swap between. And then minimal shoes are so great because they're so light so you can almost just hang them on the outside of your pack and you're not really taking that much more weight. If your goal is to be in minimal shoes versus the hike itself, then just ramp up your training way ahead of time. So that means that you're going to take your minimally shod feet onto more complex terrain. You're going to be adding lots of weight and carrying things as well as distance, going longer distances, that are maybe more of what you are going to be doing on a backpack trip. So if you've worn minimal shoes say for years, but the longest walk that you've ever taken in them is 5 miles then you might want to plan a couple of 10 mile or 15 mile walks in them because you might find that at that load, which includes the duration and the frequency that you're not adapted to them as much as you think that you are. Remember that frequency is maybe the most important variable. \xa0And that goes for terrain exposure, distance, or duration depending on how you think about it time wise or distance wise and then as well as the complexity of the terrain itself. So think about all of that. Like I suggested, bring a pair of backup footwear. \xa0Now as far as for what I wear, it depends on the season, the terrain, and the weather. \xa0And I post regularly on social media what I'm taking and why and where I'm going to kind of maybe help you see the formula that I use. But in general, last summer I wore I guess Unshoes and Earthrunners almost exclusively. And bare feet the rest of the time. \xa0I did one backpacking trip with Vibrams and Unshoes. So, Vibrams, a lot of times, will be my more supportive shoe. Where Unshoes would be my minimal, thinner, more flexible. But it depends on dryness. I don't take Vibrams in the wet because they don't work very well. My husband prefers to backpack barefoot when the complexity is not very much and it's also dry. If we add complexity, he'll add Vibrams. With greater complexity, though, and if there's any wet, he wears Run Amoks from "", "". And he prefers the thicker sole. I think it's 3 or 4 millimeters because he appreciates the traction. \xa0So anyway, I hope this helps and again, thank you to the Collective for sponsoring these questions. I'll do another question here in a bit."", 'JASON: Oh, very happy to be here. Thanks for having me.', 'KATY: Ok, before we get started, I have this funny story. I do a lot of interviews. You probably do too. But when I was initially setting off to do some publicity for Move Your DNA, again for which you wrote the forward, I got this question. And the question was: Katy Bowman, how old were you when you set off to circumnavigate the globe and conducted this interview. Like it was me that had done this physical feat. And I was like, ""Yeah, that wasn\'t me. That was Jason Lewis who wrote the forward for ', '."" \xa0So again, I think that is one of the most hilarious interview questions I\'ve ever received. And I just wanted to share that with you because I\'m sure you can relate to something like that.', 'JASON: Oh no. There is a big difference between journalists who do their research and unfortunately the vast majority these days, because they don\'t have the time or whatever, everyone\'s so busy, they very often just read off a cheat sheet like a press release and they\'re like, ""So, what have you done?"" And I\'m like, ""Ok."" \xa0So I totally understand how that happened. Someone didn\'t do their research properly.', 'JASON: So, um, that\'s a really great question because some of your listeners might be relieved to know that I was not an expert at all. Because it wasn\'t my idea, either, to do this circumnavigation by human power. It was actually a friend of mine from college. \xa0And he came up with the idea and he pitched me and he say ""Hey, would you fancy going along."" And one of my first questions was neither of us have done anything like this before. And he said, ""Well, if you can walk in a straight line and if you can pedal a bicycle, then you, then anybody could do a journey like this."" \xa0And I think it was that innate simplicity that appealed to me. That you didn\'t have to be an expert to do a journey like this. Or even a portion of a journey like this. And there were lots of adventurous things that people do these days that are extreme. And even I, I mean my nephews, for example, they\'re into these endurance running and they do iron man and one of them\'s just run a hundred miles. And I can\'t even get my head around doing something like that. But what Steve and I did was very doable by just anybody, you know, riding a bicycle. Like you said, our first day out from London, when we had been so busy preparing for this journey that we hadn\'t even had time to get fit, the first day, I think we made like 50 miles and that seemed like an enormous day. \xa0And then we had the boat that we pedaled across the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian oceans. And the first day out from Portugal, I remember it was, ""Oh my. How are we gonna do this."" \xa0And we just did some 30 or 40 miles and that gradually, of course, became 40-50-60 miles as we built up our fitness. \xa0But the point I\'m making and the point that I think you\'re trying to tease out is actually if you can just start, if you can just begin, the idea of, for example, pedaling across an ocean or even riding your bike from one side of the continent, or even your state to the other, the idea of it can be very intimidating. And almost too much. But if you say, ""You know what, I\'m just gonna begin. And I\'ll just do a little bit."" And if you just take little chunks then before you know it you\'re doing it and before you know it, you\'ve done it. \xa0So that, I suppose, if there\'s anything that I can share it\'s that you don\'t have to be, you know, if you want to get more movement in your life and you want to do something a little bit bigger other than what you can squeeze into your average work day, then the key thing is just to begin. It\'s to start something. And then you\'ll find you\'re actually doing it and you become really good at it after a while.', 'KATY: \xa0I like that answer because I think that there is a belief that big movement feats are done by those that are already fit or capable rather than remembering or paying attention to the idea that movement is the conduit to more movement. That if you want to do a big feat, you just, you have to do it and that the big feat, the borders around a big feat can also include the training for that feat. \xa0But before I go any further, how many miles made up your journey.', 'JASON: The total mileage around the planet was 46,505 miles.', ""KATY: I probably should have lead with that. Because that number is just... it's staggering. I thought my 20-mile monthly walk was big but that number is staggering. And one interesting thing in your books, at least to me, was how you choose how you were going to get yourself around the planet. So I think I would have, my assumption would have been that you walked over the earth or cycled and then you rode or paddled in the water. But as someone explained to you the problem with rowing or paddling, using your arms essentially to get across the watery portions of the planet would have landed you on land with really strong arms but legs that couldn't, that wouldn't be really physically adapted to all of that movement. \xa0That you essentially would have weaker legs by the time you landed on land and so you retrofitted your boat to have pedals so that you could basically create that pedaling strength - you could capitalize on the pedaling strength whether you were on the land or in the water. \xa0Is that right?"", 'JASON: That is correct and that is the reason why the original designer of the boat said, ""you know what, you\'re gonna be riding the bikes on land, when you get to the edge of a land mass, let\'s use your legs to then power the boat across the oceans rather than your arms. So correct. That\'s exactly right.', ""KATY: I like how the law of specificity is kind of called out over and over in your book, whether or not you use those words. When I read your adventures I'm really seeing that, I'm seeing you embody a lot of the laws that we read about in exercise science theoretically. We read the theory and here you are, you know, you've been pedaling across the ocean for weeks and then there's a great circumstance in the book where you have to get on a larger vessel in the sea only to find that your legs have kind of lost their capability for walking. You still have strong legs ..."", 'JASON: Yeah.', ""JASON: So it was primarily, I think, choosing human power. Human movement was a very conscious decision on both our parts, as a way for us to really go out and connect with the world. With different environments and also different people that we wouldn't have otherwise got to meet at a grassroots organic level if we had been riding in a car or in a train or even on a motorcycle. I mean the more mechanized the transport that we use, the less connection that we have with the landscapes that we travel through and the people that we might meet in those landscapes. And I think we left in the mid-90s and now human power, there's been quite a resurgence, I guess, in human-powered feats. People doing human-powered activities, which is great. But at that time there really wasn't many people doing these ... in fact, I remember, there was a big contention because we called it initially man-powered. The first man-powered trip around the world, because human powered, the term human-powered didn't really exist. And people said man-powered that's really politically incorrect so that's why we ended up calling it human powered. But it was a way, the journey, the choice of human power in addition to being a cheap form of transport, that's always good, also was a way for us to be able to connect at a very organic level with people and landscapes. And in our minds, that was a way to really see the world. And to really understand the world. And understand these different environments, be it the ocean or the middle of the desert in Australia, or the mountains of Tibet. You know you got to get out of the motorized vehicle. Get out from that pane of glass to really understand how the world works. And that's what we were aiming for."", ""KATY: That really resonates with me because I've walked and driven the same 20-mile stretch and I would say that the knowledge that I am gathering from both of those experiences differs radically. And most of us are moving so quickly through where we actually live -our landscape. The area, the city, the town surrounding where we spend the bulk of our time. And the knowledge that we have of it relates to how we interact with it in our cars and homes. \xa0So definitely, I have personally experienced the value of recognizing all of the things that I can learn and thus kind of embody about my own habitat when I move through it on my own power. You can think about it as kind of removing walls if you will."", 'JASON: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: One of the main reasons I wanted to have you on this podcast is because I really, I think that some people set out for physical feats for the sheer physical challenge of it. That\'s their sole motivation or their primary motivation. And then there\'s other reasons that we set out, as you were talking about, connecting with people, connecting with landscapes, getting the rate of the flow of land by your face to some natural level. But I\'m really intrigued with this other idea that large physical feats, human-powered physical feats, might, in fact, be a biological imperative for some of us, if not all of us, on some scaleable level. Obviously, humans got to where they are now because of this regular setting off to move long distances. And so I think of so many people feeding back to say ""Oh when I finally went barefoot, I felt like this was what my feet were supposed to do."" But you didn\'t know it until you transitioned and experienced it. That maybe these longer journeys within us are actually kind of like, it\'s a genetic impulse to do it. So one of the data points that I have is this information that I just got from you which is you and your wife are about to set off again. So I want to talk about that.', ""JASON: Yeah, so I basically want to go back to points on my circumnavigation journey, revisit communities that live in very remote parts of the world either because these people are isolated by water or by desert or by ice, by mountain ranges. And because these people are so isolated they, by nature, live sustainably. They live within finite means. And I want to go back with Tammie to understand how it is that these people live without sort of the surrounding influence of globalization. Because I think that this knowledge of self-sufficiency is something that we've lost in the west: Living better with less. But it will involve pedaling my boat - the same boat that I used during the circumnavigation - it will involve pedaling Moksha (the boat) from the Solomon Islands to this little remote island in the South Pacific. It's about 460 miles. So using human power to reach this location is a very important part of that expedition."", 'KATY: How long does it take to pedal 460 miles?', 'JASON: So we do about, I mean we could probably do it in about 2 weeks. That would be my guess. About 2, 2 and a half, 3 weeks.', 'KATY: So is it non-stop?', 'JASON: \xa0Pretty much, yeah.', 'KATY: What are the logistics involved in a trip like this?', ""JASON: There's no land in between so, and the boat is so small and utilitarian, there's only one position for someone to sleep at any one time. So there's really an incentive for someone to be awake pedaling even at night. So we typically do 3-hour pedal shifts in the day, 4-hour pedal shifts at night. And the added advantage of that is someone is always awake and looking out for ships that might otherwise run us down. "", 'KATY: Mmm.', ""JASON: So yeah, it's very much centered around the pedals. \xa0And just to sort of touch upon the last point you made one of the, I suppose one of the selling points for me of using pedal power, in this case, a pedal-powered boat to reach this location, is that the repetition of pedaling becomes like a meditation. \xa0And it always allows, on my previous journeys, it's allowed me to prepare... or rather it's allowed me to really ... It's like walking sometimes when you need to think about something or when I need to be able to really think through something that might be troubling me, like a problem, very often just walking will allow sort of my body to be engaged in this activity and allow my mind to really creatively free think. And pedaling the boat is like that. It becomes meditative. It will allow us, I think, \xa0to really prepare for arriving at this remote location and to really get ourselves into a mindset that I think will be conducive to getting the most out of our visit to this little island."", ""KATY:\xa0 And here's what I just can't get over; Your partner doesn't swim, right?"", ""JASON: \xa0She's laughing. You can hear her in the background. \xa0Have you ever swum before Tammie?"", ""TAMMIE: I'm frightened to death of water. I can't even tell you. I have dreams about drowning."", ""JASON: So that's a really good start. But I'm always a great believer. And I love the idea of people who are non experts trying something that they have not done before. And on my circumnavigation, I think I had about 25 people who joined me for different legs and many of them had never been to sea. They had never ridden a bicycle more than a few miles. And these people, I mean, without exception, all were terrified to ... or not terrified but they were, they had reservations about joining the particular part of the expedition that they were joining. But at the end of the month or three months or however long their normal lives could allow, they came away with just this amazing experience and this amazing kind of faith in their ability to something which previously they didn't think they could do. And I think that's a really big part of doing these expeditions, is trying something that you've never done before."", ""JASON: Tammie, what do you think? You're the one who is gonna have to... I mean I think, is it all right if Tammie answers this question only because..."", 'KATY: Absolutely!', ""JASON: ...she's about to do something which maybe your listeners might consider themselves. You're basically in the same boat - excuse the pun."", ""TAMMIE: \xa0Well I think sadly that it should be a natural phenomenon but it's not. You know? \xa0I think many many many years ago it wouldn't have been out of the ordinary for me to have to get into a lake to get something or to be around water. But I have consciously chosen to be away from water even when I lived on the beach, you know, a hundred feet, I could have walked into the ocean, but I was busy. I had work to do. I had things to do. And I think society has become so dependent on things that are supposed to simplify our lives. Drive-thrus, microwavable meals, texting, all of these things that are supposed to make our lives more simple, have made it more complicated and given us less time. And so as terrified as I am, I know that as a human being we're born in water. We are made up of water. What could be more natural? And so, I'm going to do it because I know that it's good for me as a human and it brings awareness to a good cause. But I won't lie ... I am truly frightened. I'm very frightened of it. But, I don't want to be and I know it's not human nature to be frightened of water."", 'KATY: Ok friends I hope that helps! \xa0That was circulated pretty wide on social media because I think a lot of people were like, ""Yes, that was exactly the explanation I was looking for. It definitely sounds cuter when you\'re four years old."" \xa0Thank you, again, to our Collective and Venn Design for bringing that simple explanation out in the world. I hope you find it helpful. \xa0Let\'s get back to the show.', ""JASON: \xa0Oh, um, probably, ok, so the most physically demanding section was rollerblading, inline skating, across the U.S. Because the biking and the pedal boat, those all involved, you know, mechanics, where of course it's a lot easier, for example, if you're scaling the Rocky Mountains, here in Colorado, you have gears to help you get over them on a bicycle. \xa0And even kayaking, for example, part of the journey was kayaking, through the Indonesian chain of Islands from Australia to Singapore. \xa0Even then that was hard work but it still wasn't as hard as rollerblading. And I think that was because the rollerblading involved, you basically ... it's just you and the wheels. And if you hit, if I hit an uneven patch of road which would sometimes last for many miles on the B and C rolls, rollerblading through the American south, that would just be an absolute killer on my legs. \xa0When I ended up being hit by a drunk driver here in Colorado and put into a hospital with two broken legs, and I remember the surgeon saying when I was first admitted that he thought my thigh bones were broken because I had such massive thighs. So this is the only downside, I guess, of these sort of mono forms of exercise, be it rollerblading or biking or kayaking is you end up with sort of accentuated muscle masses in those particular areas. And rollerblading had huge legs, but my upper body wasn't getting as much exercise. \xa0So, it was interesting. Compared to normal life now where I feel like I have a more well-rounded exercise regime, on the expedition it was sort of, it was very specific to a particular body area which I don't think was always that healthy."", 'KATY: Definitely the diversity and distribution of movement is ... one of the nice benefits is that it can keep you from getting really really strong developed parts kind of hanging on not as developed parts which are a precursor to their own type of injury. \xa0But over all did you feel that you were physically improved head to toe or were there some trade offs, I guess, as far as how your body works now that you can relate back to that period of time or that experience?', ""JASON: \xa0Yeah. I definitely. I'm 50 years old now. And I started this journey in my late 20s. So I definitely have some tweaks. I have to, every day now, when I'm not doing, for example, I'm not on an expedition, I have to do my core exercises every day, twice a day, just for 5-10 minutes and every other day I do a yoga routine. I do a stretching routine. If I don't do, if I don't keep to that regime, the I will find some of these historic aches and pains, these tweaks, starting to creep, starting to come back and haunt me. But as far as the overall fitness I felt at the end of the journey, I felt, I mean I was amazingly fit by the time I finished. \xa0I think my heart is a pretty, I think my chiropractor said I have one of the largest hearts he'd ever encountered. I don't think he was referring to my human..."", 'KATY: Your capacity for loving?', ""JASON: Yeah, my capacity for loving. I think he meant the physiology. So I think and that has definitely that fitness has definitely kind of passed through. Even 10 years since completing this journey I still consider myself a pretty fit person. I have pretty good muscle mass and I try and keep that. But I have to keep it up now because of the age I am and I don't want to get up in the morning and be sort of crippled by a hip pain or something. But as long as I keep my little exercises going then I'm fine."", 'KATY: Are you going to train at all before heading off to the island?', 'JASON: Uh...', 'TAMMIE: No is the answer to that.', ""JASON: \xa0I used to have...we used to have this joke. We called it weight training which was basically waiting until it was time to go before we started training. But yeah, I think this time I might have to do a little bit of training just because, just with age, one has to be a little bit more sensible about these things. \xa0Tammie? I don't know. Tammie, you're getting fit already?"", ""TAMMIE: Oh yes. I'm starting. I'm doing my little routine. Because unfortunately I'm like a lot of people and I spend a good portion of my life on the computer. And sitting. And I'm older than Jason so I can definitely feel it. That's why I'm so grateful for people like you, Katy, that talk about the importance of movement. I need you to just come and live with me for a couple of weeks and hit me with a two by four."", 'KATY: Yeah. You and everyone else except for everyone in my own family. \xa0Is there a place to follow this upcoming journey? Is there internet out in the middle of the ocean?', ""JASON: \xa0Well, yeah there is. We'll have a satellite phone and you can send data. I mean these days, unfortunately... see this is the thing. Traveling, moving has changed quite a lot from the days when we started when there was no internet in the wide open spaces. So you could really be out there in the middle of the ocean or out in the desert and just be. Be present. Which is one of the beauties of doing human power or propelling one's self by natural movement. I think one of the nice things is to not be connected to that device in your hand. \xa0But the reality of expeditions these days is you typically, for sponsorship reasons primarily, you have to update a blog occasionally or social media. So yeah, we will have the ability to send updates from the field and take photographs and that kind of thing. \xa0But it's like I said, it's a trade-off. I hate taking these gizmos into the field because it does detract from the experience of just being out there."", ""KATY: Yeah, the lack of technology makes me think of this part in your book where you're essentially bobbing around in the ocean with no light and just the noise of the ocean itself and none of the other inputs that we've got kind of that we're exposed to on a regular basis. And it just makes me think of sensory deprivation tanks and this idea that we have to go to a place in a room to get a lack of exposure which is, which just becomes a heightened state of awareness once you decrease some of the overload and that is, again, something that can be found by stepping out and away. It's, again, another element of a journey which makes me again think that a lot of us are always trying to take journeys. Or again getting elements of journeys and even maybe the desire to get in your car and drive across a state or a country is another way of meeting that need to just ... to just travel isn't the right word. It's to be of a different place maybe."", 'JASON: Mm-hmm. Right.', 'JASON: The two riders were Hugh McGregor, he\'s a Scottish actor, originally, but is quite well known. People might remember him from the Star Wars movies and his friend Charlie Borman. But they were making a TV show. So that was the sort of primary impetus for them riding their motorcycles from the north of Scotland down to Cape Town. And like I said, it was a little bit comical because they, their whole setup was definitely with making a TV show in mind. So they had three support vehicles that, of course, you didn\'t see on the show. \xa0They had all the gear. And I remember one of the produces jumping out of his truck and looking at the bottles of water that I had stacked behind my bike seat that was all murky and disgusting because it was from the river Nile. \xa0And that was the only water that I was able to access at that point in the Sahara Desert and I would just put a few drops of iodine in to make it drinkable and he was like, ""Oh you\'re not drinking that stuff are you?"" \xa0And I said, ""Well it\'s the only choice I have."" So he ran around the back of one of the vehicles where they had a fridge and pulled out a nice cold bottle of Evian water and I have to say it was pretty good tasting water. \xa0But it just summed up the whole, like you said, the juxtaposition of our two journeys. And they were having a good time. And they were producing entertainment first and foremost but they were also having an adventure. You know, two guys that are otherwise very busy in the entertainment business. The one thing I would sort of add to what you just mentioned about the merits of human power, and this is something I actually talk about quite a lot to schools, especially high schoolers and 10th, 11th, 12th grade, who are looking to go out into the world and choose a career and that kind of thing. Is that, when you take a journey out into the world, and especially if it\'s a journey that is using natural power as in your own power, you become an ambassador for your own culture. And there were lots of occasions where, for example, I was about to enter a predominantly Muslim country. Indonesia has the highest proportion of Muslims in the world. Or it might have been Syria (this was before the war, mind you.) Other countries where I was a little bit, where people were saying, ""Yeah, is it a really good idea to go through there?"" And when I rode my bike through there or walked through there or whatever it might have been, I found, without exception, that the people responded to the way that I was traveling. Which, if you think about it, even kayaking through the Solomon islands, kayaking through Indonesia, it\'s natural movement. Human power is the way that most of the local people still get around these parts of the world - in dug out canoes in the Solomon Islands. And there was this instant connection with us in our kayaks rather than turning up in a great big cruise ship like tourists normally do. \xa0And you\'re just basically a walking dollar. \xa0So, the beauty of human power is it really allowed me to connect with people on a level that the local people could relate to. Even if we could barely speak each other\'s language. Like in rural China for example. It just allowed them also to see that, wow, you know, someone from the U.K. or from America ... I traveled with a lot of Americans as well on my journey ... they\'re not the same as what we read about in the newspapers or see about on the news. They\'re not a representation of what we think America or Europe is about. And it really allows you to reset some of the misconceptions and prejudgements that people might have about our own culture because you get to meet them and they just say, ""you know what? you\'re just a normal person too. And you\'re just trying to do your thing."" And so I think you become a very powerful ambassador. Especially in this world, right now, where we are so...seem to be so divided. Everyone seems to be pulling into their own corner. Isolationism seems to be the rule of the day. I think it\'s more important than ever now for people to set off on these journeys. And they don\'t have to be long journeys. They can just be a few weeks or a few days. It\'s important to go out into the world and to connect with people at a base human powered level.', ""KATY: Oh this makes me think of gap years. What if a movement journey was a way many people utilized their gap year? What if the travel that so many people set out to do, I've never taken a gap year - I think I started writing a book the minute I graduated high school. But for those that did take a gap year, what if travel was the by-product of a human-powered gap year? \xa0"", 'JASON: Right.', 'KATY: So that you are setting off to not only gather the experience and knowledge of other places and cultures but to be introduced to the experiment, like the experience of moving yourself. Which would be hugely eye-opening for someone coming from a sedentary culture which is most people listening.', ""JASON: \xa0I think that's a great idea. I think we should definitely get funding somehow for that. To give scholarships maybe for some young people to, or older people, to go on a journey like that. And to share their stories. \xa0There's actually an interesting project going on right now by a journalist called "", ' And he\'s called ""', '"" and he\'s walking from the cradle of civilization in Ethiopia. The cradle of civilization - he\'s retracing the human migratory route through central and far Asia. I think his intention is to actually walk all the way up to the Bering Straits, down through North and South America to where humans eventually settled of course down in the far south of South America. \xa0Anyway, really interesting project that I would really highly recommend people checking out. And he\'s doing it all by foot. And it\'s taking a long time. But he again is sort of, through his storytelling, and he\'s a very good writer, and I think it\'s all going through National Geographic as well. But through his storytelling, we\'re really able to as you know sitting in our living rooms able to experience at a grassroots level these cultures that our very very early ancestors would have walked through. So it\'s a really fascinating journey.', ""KATY: I've been following it and I will go ahead and I will "", "" so if any of you are interested you can also read it. Beautiful writing. When he's writing it's beautiful. When he is being interviewed, the way he writes walking... it's just gorgeous. \xa0Like I am moved by the way that he's explaining the journey. \xa0Ok, so we've talked about these mind-boggling expeditions, ways of moving, that most listening won't get a chance to do. So I want to scale it a little bit to talk about ways that we can all find a little bit of this expedition within us. So one of the things that I've been doing, I've talked about it on my health recap podcast is doing a monthly 20-miler. \xa0And the reason I walk a monthly 20-miler ... it's for so many of the reasons that we've covered so far. It's meditative. It connects me to the people and the plants and the animals, like all the living things. The earth itself. \xa0For me, it is a way of seeing what's going on around me at human speed versus the speed of my car. I also walk because I speak a lot about that things are becoming unwalkable. Our ability to move on this planet is being reduced to areas that are ok to walk on. So I walk 30-40 miles on my birthdays that are in the 30s and 40 years. And last year I was hanging off the side of a highway with my arms because there wasn't any space for my feet because the cars had full priority of this space. So for four miles, I was walking on a trail, hanging off the side of it. So I walk to stay aware of the fact that things that decisions that I'm a part of by the way that I prioritize my time and my money, that the tax, the biological tax, is less walkability. Or that I am able to walk but in a way that doesn't allow me to get anywhere else. I can walk in a loop at some space. And so if, indeed, there is this need to move over the planet, to actually go somewhere versus simply move my legs forward and backward and it's an important element of human experience to preserve. So, let's think about, as everyone listening, what can we do to take steps towards using our landscape differently. Keeping in mind that the scale could be whatever we need it to be."", 'JASON: Yeah. I think it\'s an excellent point that you bring, which is, I mean for example, in our local community here in Colorado, where I\'m aware of that... I see people, for example, they\'ve got their bikes on the back of their SUV and they\'re going out to where the bike trails are outside of town. And I always think why don\'t you just get your bike out of the garage and just ride your bike out to where the trails are or you don\'t, so you don\'t, ok, so the trail\'s probably more interesting than riding on the highway, fair enough. But it\'s also walking, like you said, every time... Tammie and I, we try and be mindful about getting in our cars automatically because you do, it is very easy just to sort of slip in to auto mode where you just think ok I\'ll just go down to the store and grab a couple of things. And our store is about a mile and a half away? \xa0Two miles maybe? \xa0Very quick in a car but it\'s totally walkable. On a bike it takes about six or seven minutes on a bicycle. \xa0And so we do and sort of, before we get in the car, ""Ok, do we really need to get in the car this time? Maybe we could bike. Maybe we could walk. Maybe we could make a little - you know - we could walk together. Maybe we could ride bikes together."" \xa0Because as you eluded to, it\'s a win-win situation. I mean, physically it\'s good exercise. You\'re saving money. You\'re not belching out carbon from your car. But also, it\'s a way for you to explore your community. And one thing I notice here in the U.S. is people can live next door to each other and they rarely have anything to do with each other. On the same street. In fact, our street is a good example. We know the people to the right of us. \xa0But we don\'t really know the people to the left of us that well. And the only time I\'ve ever really interacted with them was when I was walking down the road and they just happened to be out there working on their yard. \xa0Versus communities where there\'s not a lot of mechanized transport where people because they\'re walking because they\'re using human power to navigate their way around their community, they have to deal with people. They have to interact with people. And I think that that helps to build a healthier community. And so, that\'s something... and we\'re not very good at it here in the U.S. because we\'re busy, everyone\'s busy and it\'s like, ""Oh my goodness, I don\'t have time. I\'ll just jump in the car instead."" But I think it is important to try just before you automatically step in that automobile think, ""Hmmm do I have to do this or maybe if I left a little bit earlier I could actually walk or ride my bike."" I think that\'s a really important discipline to try to get in to.', 'KATY: One of the reasons I think people load their bike to their SUV and drive out of the areas that they live in is because deep down there is a recognition that this type of experience, you know, being out and away from everyone else, moving through, you know, maybe not completely unaltered but less altered landscapes is something akin to what you found bobbing in the ocean. That it\'s not simply the motions it\'s where and how you\'re doing the motions that the landscape itself, the nature of it, is a nutrient. It\'s a separate nutrient. And as more people tune in to this recognition that they don\'t only need to move, that they need to move uninterruptedly. That they need to move continuously for, consecutive hours sometimes in spaces that are feeding them in some way that we don\'t yet understand. The more that they can recognize that that\'s a need, then they can see that their own personal health, if it\'s a nutrient, you know, that they\'re health is dependent on maybe activism in the environmental sectors, how that ultimately does relate back to them maybe not because they even were thinking about the environment. Like they could still be thinking about themselves. ""Oh this is actually, I recognize that this is something that I need to do."" And once you dip your toe in you\'re gonna need to do it usually a lot more often. To me the role that I play and what I\'m doing with my books and my work and even this podcast - and especially this podcast series - is to really flesh out movement ecology. To see that once you recognize that the movement is a necessity, then you begin to look at all of your non-movement or non-exercise time and recognize the relationship between those two things. How does what I choose to do when I\'m not moving impact the rest of the time when I do want to go move? \xa0And for many of us, again, that journey within us - there\'s a metaphorical journey in that it takes a long time, I think, to discover the things that we each need. And then there is a larger, there\'s a scientific journey of discovering all of the elements at play. And then there is simply putting one foot in front of the other or using your arms in a way that helps you move. Some sort of way of starting to ramp up your human power that no matter the scale, you are going to change your experience.', 'JASON: Absolutely and it doesn\'t have to be, you know, you don\'t have to take 13 years to go around the planet to have an adventure. \xa0You can, it might sound a little bit cliche, but I guarantee you just walk out your door and you go for a walk and you know, just somewhere where you normally drive, I guarantee you could have an adventure. It\'ll be different to driving. I think you touched on a really good point, Katy, about these common spaces that, the commons as they used to be known, of public, nobody owns these green, these wild spaces. \xa0They are essential in ways that we have difficulty articulating. Certainly in financial terms. So right now we\'re looking at a politician that\'s looking to shrink some of these public lands and the reason why is because perhaps some financial profit from exploiting them for oil and gas, whatever it may be. But I think that until we put a financial price, or rather until we put a tangible price tag on what these public spaces are worth in terms of our own personal health and well being, then they\'re always going to be under threat from other interests looking to encroach upon them. And I think it\'s really important for people to realize that you know these, because more and more people are living on this planet, and more and more people want houses built out in the middle of nowhere. \xa0These spaces are under threat. And it\'s very very difficult to get them back. It\'s almost impossible to get them back. So we really have to get away from the whole tree hugger mentality of like, ""Oh well the only people who want to save these spaces are hippies and tree huggers."" \xa0It\'s really, they\'re a resource for all of us who work normal lives, who work normal jobs, who have the need to go out there for our lunch break or in the evenings or the weekends, to keep ourselves sane and to keep ourselves physically healthy. I think they\'re almost, it\'s like, they\'re one of the most valuable assets that we have still remaining on our planet that we really have to safeguard.', ""KATY: Oh. That was beautifully said and is really a perfect place to end. Just let that hang in the air a little bit. \xa0Jason, thank you so much for being my guest - my first guest - here on Move Your DNA. Jason Lewis is the author of three award-winning books for adults. They're fabulous. I've read them all. \xa0They are called the "", "". \xa0And one of the nice things about books like this, if you're trying to ramp up your psyche into being out in nature more, moving more, it really does help to make that what you take in as far as what you're reading. So I find them hugely inspiring and again, as I mentioned before, Jason's journey is the - he is explaining what it is like to do all of this movement. So for so many people who study movement whose lives are movement, it is mostly in a theoretical sense. Meaning, I study movement way more hours than I ever move. And it's definitely a ratio that I am working on changing. Because I realize that what I want to get to is actually knowing the movement, not knowing the explanations about movement. So the series is great. And it's also just been translated isn't the right word but adapted into a young adult version."", 'JASON: Yeah. Sort of 13 through 18-year-old range. Tammie edited them.

This limitation that then changes the “shape” or geometry of the gait pattern, which is a way that you walk and also the shape of your squat. This geometry, in turn, affects which muscles are recruited when you walk or squat.

I have a movement life and I have an interest in trying to become a better farmer, homesteader. For a long time, those were two separate facets. It's only in the last 3-4 years that I've realized how much that they've actually merged. So I was listening to this farming podcast and then here is a wildlife tracker who is talking about when ... I mean you were still a teenager at this point. Right? Were you 19 or 20 when you were running, you know, you would run 20 miles. You got out, they dropped you off with a water bottle and you run 20 miles into the forest and you're just tracking these alpha wolves."", 'DONIGA: Yeah I was probably more like 16, 17.', 'KATY: Oh my gosh!', 'DONIGA: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: So I heard her on this podcast and I had a visceral reaction.

I sent an email. You were hard to find online. Didn\'t even have social media I don\'t think. And I sent you an email to say - because I have a publishing company - I said, ""If you have a book inside of you, I would like to publish it."" \xa0And I think it was that bold.

So I want to talk about the content in ', "" which is you took that story and you tied it into, it's like a wilderness memoir. If you were to explain "", ' to my listeners how would you?', 'DONIGA: Thank you Katy for following your intuition and contacting me because I did have a book inside of me and so to explain ', "", really it's about my journey starting from a young woman of very deep questioning and curiosity and a drive to get in touch with my senses, my instincts, my sort of calling in life. And experience that through none other than nature as a way to connect with myself. And so I didn't want to follow any path of some typical man because that's who has written a lot the books and even when I was going to school a lot of the heroes were men. And so I really forged my own path without having a lot of female role models but connecting directly with nature and with the animals. And then that brought me to a larger holistic vision and that journey through connecting with nature brought me into the work that I do today which is regenerative ranching. So, regenerative is a term that is just starting to take root and it's essentially providing life by giving more life in return for every life you take. So the form of regenerative agriculture that we do is large scale grassland restoration and mimicking nature to provide nutrient dense foods for thousands of families here in the San Francisco Bay area where we live. \xa0And I think, thinking about it, I never really thought about my journey in the context of movement but I think without that movement and without connecting to the way my body works and these natural patterns, my journey really has been about movement. And every time that I find myself spending more sedentary hours, I find things starting to deteriorate. Whether it's mentally, physically..so I think that because I've been so patterned to be very engaged in my body and engaged in my senses that being sedentary is very foreign to me. And actually, I think the most sedentary I've ever been in my life is writing "", '.', 'KATY: That was going to be one of my questions.', ""DONIGA: But then you helped me to try to figure out different ways that I could still work on the computer. But it's hard. Because when you get into a zone with writing and I think a lot ... I've spent a lot of time with very creative visionary type people. And when they get this, it's almost like a trance. And then everything else falls away and sometimes I would just be - have a cup of tea or cup of bone broth sitting by my computer and I have my hood on and I would just be staring close to the computer screen and for hours not thinking of anything else because I would just sort of enter into this trance mode. Then after realizing how detrimental that was to my health, I had to force myself to sort of break out of that and then go shift and move. Because when I was learning wilderness survival and wildlife tracking and nature awareness, we would start the day by movement. And we would start the day with animal forms. And I think I shared some animal forms with you, Katy, when you came to our local nature program down here. But that was instrumental to what we did. Was moving like an animal."", 'KATY: I reached out to you obviously because I was moved by your story but it was also, I think, for some of the reasons that you just touched on. You know, I\'m constantly working and developing and trying to define the nuances of this thing that we call natural movement and often natural movement as far as popular culture goes falls within rewilding and the paleo movement which, I have always found to be extremely ... there\'s not a lot of women, necessarily, in those movement spheres, as authorities and so alongside that natural movement tends to, when you think of it - when you say those words, you think of sprinting, running long distances, like very large physical feats. Which it definitely does embody. \xa0However, there\'s - you know a lot of my work is breastfeeding is a natural movement. Chewing. You know, squatting. These things that, when I work with other people who teach natural movements they\'re like, ""I can\'t teach a movement...I don\'t know how to teach a movement class where acorn gathering is the star. We need to do 30 squats. Or if I had everyone squat underneath a tree and hold it for three minutes and set it up as that challenge. \'You guys are gonna hold for 3 minutes and squat until you have tears running out of your eyes.\'"" But the idea of doing - when we came up and visited you, we spent a day at Doniga\'s school and it was acorn gathering day. So I have this video of my daughter with her gathering bag in a squat. I mean she was in a squat for 6 minutes but she was walking in a squat to pick up the acorns. Just come up and come down, come up and come down. \xa0Her body wasn\'t signaling her to do that because it wasn\'t a struggle for her to be down there. And so trying to help some of these movement teachers recognize that there are other purposes to movement than just the movements themselves. And I was explaining to someone else that I was really trying to bring this other voice to this wilderness movement. This wild food, natural movement. Just to help balance out the energy that we\'re talking about it. And I read on Instagram, I don\'t know if you saw this but someone wrote this about your book and I\'m gonna read it to you and then we can talk about it.', ""One of the lessons that became clearer to me from my experience in New Mexico is that I have a desire to go deeper into embodying my wild nature. Natural movement is just one of the paths there. As I devour the wisdom of Doniga's experience, I realize that there are so many other trails to follow to that destination as well. That natural movement will simply happen when you take the time to truly become the deer or the wolf, to dance like the weasel or bear. In light of my failure to pass the advanced movement course (she was trying to certify in this next level of MovNat) and subsequent negative self- talk I've subjected myself to, reading her words has been like a gentle, warm embrace, urging me to take the long-view and see the bigger picture. Though I do want to test myself and expand my limits physically and mentally, I don't feel like I need to do some crazy, scary rail-balancing combo to do that. Or cheese grater my hands and arms climbing up a stucco wall. I feel more called by the ability to move silently, to stay aware and be one with my surroundings- moving in them, not just through them."", ""When I read that I was like, this is exactly why this book. It is the balance of all of those natural movements that you've been trying to the fitness world but not necessarily to... fitness is an interesting term. There's physical fitness, which is all those tests and your capacity and your muscle mass. Then there's biological fitness: How well you would do, your offspring would do, in an environment. So to me, "", "" and the things that you do, Doniga, the things that you learned at wilderness awareness school, that you are putting out there in your nature school, and that you're writing and speaking about is this balance to fitness. It's like the full picture of fitness being well enough, capable enough physically to walk silently, is huge. To be able to sit still for a long period of time and observe and it also makes natural movement that much more accessible to those who are feeling like the physical feats that they associate with natural movement aren't available to them. The fact that you can still train yourself to sit comfortably outside in the weather and observe. To me, that is so exciting. So one; Thank you for writing the book. \xa0And now I have to get to some questions because we could just talk forever."", 'DONIGA: Yeah.', ""DONIGA: Yes. Absolutely. Once you're a tracker, I think Tom Brown told me this that you're always tracking. So once you learn the basics of what types of animals live in your area, what types of habitats they live in, what they like to eat, who their predators are and then you open up this whole new world of awareness and adventure really. One of my peers in the wilderness awareness school that I talk about, her name is Ricky, and she certainly moved more like a wild animal than she did a human and she grew up and lived in Seattle. And she would have incredible adventures right out of her front door and she would have all these different trees that she would climb and so her sit spot that she found out was sort of the safest place for her to be with the homeless populations was to be high up in a tree. And she had amazing tracking stories. I remember her telling us about how she had mapped out where all of the squirrels made their caches. And she essentially made this map of the city of where the squirrels would cache the hazelnuts and she would go back later and mark if they had come back for the cache or if they didn't or if it was stolen by a jay or someone else. So, she essentially had a whole map of the city not like we're used to seeing a map on Google maps but of the wildlife trails and the birds and the things that go undetected. So she really did have sort of this secret view of the city. Now I'll have to say I've never lived in a city. I've never had a desire to. And I live, our house sits right in the middle of a thousand acre grasslands so my kids, they can walk out the front door and they could potentially find mountain lion tracks down in the drainage. However, there are amazing things to discover, really, anywhere you are at."", ""KATY: So well there's wildlife everywhere. I think we don't think of birds as wildlife, right? I think that so many people - find an Audubon center, right? I think almost every city will still have an Audubon center. We live fairly rurally as well but we also travel quite and bit and when I do travel, I'm going to very large cities. And it's very interesting to see my kids, who go to nature school outdoor school, they are so trained to engage with the green spaces. The limited green spaces that they can find, you know. Even if you're in New York City, they're pointing out the bugs that they see, what the birds are doing, these plants over here. They're just tuned to seeing it. So I think that tracking and becoming more in tune to nature is simply just a shift in perception. That there is always wilderness going on around you, nature really going on around you. You just have to train yourself how to see it."", ""DONIGA: Yes, absolutely. \xa0Yeah. It's just a shame that that's not taught from the very start in preschool and kindergarten to recognize these species and that nature really is all around us and that we depend on nature and nature depends on us and we really are a part of nature because if kids were taught that from a young age, cities would look very differently. They would be designed differently. And there's a whole other slew of mental things that I'm sure would be different in terms of people's own mental health if they have access to nature from a young age. I mean that's been proven, that when kids have access to nature then they develop more empathy and they're more likely to be environmental stewards as they get older."", ""KATY: Do you think it's changing? Because I'm seeing things like Children in Nature networks do bigger things and there's just more and more research about minute daily nature exposures as being very beneficial to our physiology and physical experiences. My hope is that people start designing urban areas to add green spaces. Make them more walkable. I've seen some of those changes. Have you seen any at all in your travels?"", 'DONIGA: Oh absolutely and I think we are fortunate enough that we live in areas and often times travel to areas that there are folks that are really consciously making those changes. However, I would say that the bulk of the country is still probably 20-30 years behind that.', ""KATY: Yeah. Definitely, there's definitely a pull to looking at the accessibility of nature for everyone."", 'DONIGA: Yeah', ""DONIGA: Yeah, so I think the first thing when even before I come upon a trail, what I will do is I'll just do a centering. So that may look like me standing or even sitting, I'll start out with my eyes closed and just a relaxed, knees bent posture, and breathe deep and connect with the earth and connect with my senses so that I don't have the jibber jabber in my mind sort of distracting me from the present moment and really the task that I have ahead of me. So that's how I'll start even before I hit the trail. And then once I find a trail, if I'm fortunate enough to find a fresh trail of a mountain lion or a wolf, if I'm actively tracking them, then what I'll do is - I do a lot squatting down with one hand palm facing down in a squat with my hand over the track. And not necessarily feeling for anything but I'm getting the sense of ok my hand's over the track and how what size is the track compared to my hand. Because as I'm trailing which is the ultimate form of tracking in my opinion. When I've tracked with indigenous hunter-gatherer people from Africa, they're not used to the Western analytical view of tracking. What they're really looking for is the animal."", 'KATY: Right.', ""DONIGA: And they find a fresh track they're off in a run to find that animal. So they track for survival. So that's very different than what you see out here in our cultures is that often somebody will see one track and oh everybody will circle around it and backs facing out and analyze and pressure releases and size and get their measuring tapes out ..."", 'KATY: So to just interrupt you, would you say that the difference is one group is tracking knowledge and the other group is tracking food or some necessity?', 'DONIGA: Yeah. That could be a good comparison. Because it is different when you track for food.', ""KATY: Right. Right. There's an urgency there."", ""KATY: Just to pause there a second for our listeners. That is a very good difference, too, between kind of geeking out on the technicality of movement done for the sake of gathering knowledge about movement versus what you learn about movement once you get moving quickly. That you are still gathering information. It's just the types of information, the way you're perceiving the information that you're gathering, and the end reason that you're doing that movement are different. \xa0Ok. I will not interrupt you again. That was such a beautiful non-movement example ... so we're back on the trail."", ""DONIGA: Yeah, so I'd be squatted down, maybe one knee higher than the other so that I can move one side of my body. So say my right hand is hovering over the track. My left hand is sort of out to the side or maybe on the ground so that I can get down to the height of the animal. So I have an idea if I'm tracking, say, a wolf, where their eyes land on the horizon. So, I'm looking down the trail as they would look down the trail. So that I can get an idea of where they're going, where they're looking and then also look for the next track. And then I'll get a sense by the information that I'm gathering from that track and from that trail, I'm seeing ok what sort of movement pattern is that animal in. So I might actually rock my body back and forth if it's in just it's baseline trot and we use the term baseline to say, ok, that probably 90 percent of the time that animal is in that baseline trot. Usually, when you see a coyote cruising across the hillside, they're in a trot. And it's only when they have to get into a lope that they do or when they're pouncing or moving slower. It's only maybe when they're closer to their den site. So I get the idea, I get the cadence, the rhythm of it and maybe rock my head back and forth. \xa0And then I start to move down the trail. But before I move down the trail what I'll do is I'll look around me. So I'll maintain that centered sense meditation and I'll look to the left. And then I'll pause. Because if you're always moving your head, you can't see movement. Have you noticed that?"", 'KATY: Yep.', ""DONIGA: So if you just look to the left and then look to the right and then look behind you, then you're not really gonna see anything. So you have to look to the left and then pause and go into wide-angle vision and see if there's any movement off to your left. Because oftentimes animals will circle around and I've had this tracking mountain lions. They will actually circle around and then be trailing me and I'll pull back. I don't realize it until later. I'll see they're tracks actually landing on top of my tracks."", 'KATY: Mmm.', ""DONIGA: So when you're tracking a predator, you need to be paying attention or even when you're in predator country. \xa0So you look to the left and you pause and you look for any movement you tune into the bird language. And then you look to the right and you pause. Behind you and pause and then look above you and pause because animals can also pounce from above in the case of a mountain lion. So it's only when I get a sense of my surroundings that I continue down the trail. And I'll go at different paces. I might walk slow, doing a really slow kind of quiet ... what we call fox walk. Or I'll jog down the trail. It just really depends on the terrain, how difficult the trail is. If it's a really difficult trail to follow I'll go slow so that I don't miss anything. And I'll stop often. And I'll go back down to a squat and I'll put my hand over the trail. And the other thing is when I'm walking or when I'm jogging, my head's not bouncing up and down. You know when you see somebody jogging maybe with the iPod in and they're cruising down a trail you'll see a lot of ups and downs movement. And they're swinging their arms. It's like they're trying to get the most out of every step but then they're kind of landing with a lot of percussion. So when I move, I'm trying to keep my eyes level and even when I'm jogging. \xa0So it doesn't, it kind of looks strange but you can imagine, say, if you were to have a rope attached to your belly button and it's more like you're being pulled to move forward. You're not thrusting yourself forward but you're getting pulled from your core - from your center. And you're not bouncing up and down. And you're landing very softly."", "" DONIGA: Yeah, absolutely. And then it'd be easier on your body, I think?"", 'KATY: Well right. To be able to do it longer, right?', 'DONIGA: Yeah. Yeah. To be able to sustain long distances. My daughter, Quince, who you\'ve met, she likes to talk to herself in the shower when she thinks nobody is listening. So just yesterday when she was in the shower I kind of quietly went in there so that she didn\'t notice I was in there. And she does this horse vaulting. So they\'re doing all of these gymnastics up on a big horse and then jumping off or doing all these tricks and landing. So a lot of the injuries happen during landing. And so she\'s going over and over in her head, ""Ok, soft landing. Imagine that you\'re landing on the heads of hundreds of little baby kittens.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'DONIGA: And I\'m thinking, ""oh gosh, that\'s kind of...""', 'KATY: Motivation. She loves kittens!', ""DONIGA: Yes she does love kittens. So maybe that's something that we can imagine. Imagine that there is a carpet of cute baby kittens and we don't want to step on their heads."", 'DONIGA: \xa0Yeah. That\'s a big one. Because so much of that fear is stemming from something that may have happened that they may not even be aware of. So, you know, maybe something that happened when they were a child and that has sort of just ingrained into their brain and their whole being, that when they come across a situation it might be like a fight or flight reaction. So I would say that overcoming fears is some of the greatest work that we can do for self-growth. \xa0And I talk about a lot of stories in my book that many people would probably say ""I would never do that. I would never sleep alone in grizzly country."" And yeah, some of it may have been that I was just this fearless teenager that nothing could harm me and yet I had other things that I was sort of up against. So I think everybody has different sort of mental barriers that we can all take steps to overcome and to start small. One of the things that we, that I\'ve always done because I was the youngest of 3 girls and my sisters would go off a lot with their friends and I was stuck alone and my mom worked a lot so I got really used to being alone. And often times I didn\'t have anyone to ride my horse with so I would jump on my horse and I would go far out into the wilderness and I would be alone. I would go down to the river alone and sit by the river. So I think the first step is just being comfortable being alone. and for longer periods of time and that may be that you go out into nature with someone but then you take two different routes. We do that a lot with our kids when they were young. It was like, ""Ok, you take this trail. I\'ll take this trail."" And if we\'re concerned that they\'ll stumble across something or there\'s a safety - we might take a trail where we can still look at them and look at their surroundings but they still have the sense that they\'re alone.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'DONIGA: So I would say that would be the first step. Spend more time alone in situations where you\'re edges are pushed. \xa0And then try to go and spend a night alone out in nature. And I think with that you\'ll start to be comfortable with the things that may come up that are perceived fears and then be able to tell yourself, ""Ok, that really wasn\'t real. That was just something that I was making up in my head."" Because really you\'re more likely to get struck by lightning than you are to get attacked by a mountain lion.', 'KATY: Right.', ""DONIGA: So we don't walk around in the rain thinking that we're gonna get struck by lightning all the time, right?"", 'KATY: Right.', ""DONIGA: So I think that's really the first step."", 'KATY: And also, I guess, for so many people, they\'re not really fluent in nature and so the more ... I always have found to get over certain fears is just surround myself with people who don\'t have that fear who I\'m on my edge simply by being with them while they\'re comfortable and so I can, my brain, my thinking, analytical part is, ""Ok, there\'s 12 people here. I\'m the only one afraid."" And so I can kind of shift my perception a little bit to being like maybe either I know something that maybe none of them know or maybe there\'s not as much of what I had to worry about. And you know, like if it\'s snakes or whatever, that you get in and you expose yourself to them in ways where it\'s made more controlled. And I\'ve just found that simply by doing it on some scale, just like pursuing fitness or exercise, you find a small amount to push you towards your edge a little bit so that you can grow through whatever is holding you back from where you want to go.', 'DONIGA: Yeah.', ""DONIGA: \xa0Yeah. Product. Hmm. \xa0Um, yeah that was something that I think, I'm probably a little different than most parents in that we really tried to limit product. And sometimes it's difficult because you get gifts from relatives."", 'KATY: Sure.', 'DONIGA: But and sometimes I even feel bad when the kids have birthdays we write on the card ""please no plastic toys."" \xa0You can get them a toy but please I don\'t want it to be plastic.', ""KATY: Right. What's the age of your kids too, just so everyone knows the context?"", 'DONIGA: We have a seven, nine, ten, and fifteen.', 'KATY: Ok.', 'DONIGA: \xa0And so in terms of what you could have sort of surrounding them which you could call toys or tools or resources, from a young age my kids really were surrounded by things that they may find outside. So wooden blocks they could stack and and build things out of were something that we always had on hand. And some of the most played with toys were very simple things like sticks or cardboard boxes. Oh man they had so much fun with cardboard - and they still do. My 10 year old when I come home with groceries I put them in the recycle wine boxes that they have at the store and I have them in there and they still curl up inside the cardboard boxes. They cut holes and make shelters. Stack them up and knock them down. \xa0So, I think really simple things like that. And then limit the amount of things that have batteries. My kids never had battery operated toys. \xa0We are on a cattle ranch, so horses are definitely a part of it. So they always had a things where they could pretend like they\'re riding a horse, or pretend like they\'re out on the ranch. Because it\'s not always practical. \xa0When you\'re cooking dinner and you have a toddler you can\'t just send them outside. They\'re in the house with you doing stuff. And then in terms of just bringing in more wilderness education into your homeschool and into the lives of your kids, what we have is, I find if I try to - because it\'s my passion, right? My passion is nature and curiosity. But if I try to push that on my kids then they lose interest. So by trying to say, ""Ok, now we\'re gonna sit down and we\'re gonna journal 5 plants."" It\'s like, ""Oh yeah right mom."" \xa0So instead what I do is I set up our environment. So the first thing when they come in the door, they have - their bookshelf is full of field guides and even before they could read they had access to field guides. And some of my kids\' favorite books as little kids to look through were bird field guides. So they are very well versed with where the chickadee is in the book. And where the woodpecker section is. So that when they are out in nature and they find something like, ""Oh I saw..."" \xa0I\'ll hear my son say, ""I saw this really really cool bird that I\'ve never seen before."" And I\'ll say, ""Oh, I don\'t know what it was. Go check in the guide."" \xa0And then sure enough he\'ll flip through the guide and he\'ll forget about that bird that he was so interested in and been looking up and he\'ll look at 50 other birds that he\'ll say, ""Oh yeah, I remember seeing that."" \xa0So, I think that having those, instead of me saying, ""Oh yeah, that\'s a ... ruby-crowned kinglet"" or ""That\'s a California Towhee"". And then his curiosity is over. He\'ll say, ""Ok, I have a name to it. I\'m going to move on to the next thing."" \xa0I have those guides there so he can research and look it up himself. And then other things are just ... I look at what I\'ve done as more facilitating experiences. \xa0And so that\'s part of why ... I married a cattle rancher yet I wanted to engage my kids from a very young age in ranch work. And so we decided to expand to animals that were a little bit more accessible to kids. \xa0And so that I could be outside with my kids at the same time working. And that\'s really important for our family because I have always needed to work full time to support our family. And so I wanted to have a line of work that I could work with my kids and that it could be outdoors. And so that\'s when we started raising a lot of chickens and doing more with the sheep and pigs. Things that are a little bit more accessible for little ones. So I did that. I would go out and even when my kids, even before they could walk, I would set up a little blanket and then I would go and work on some fencing. And then when they got a little bit older they would help me collect the eggs and do the other things. But a lot of times it was more like I was working outside and they were off running around and doing their own thing. Because often times when you try to get kids to work, they\'ll want to do the opposite. It\'s kind of like you have to model it and then every once in a while they\'ll come in and they\'ll help you a little bit. \xa0And then they\'ll run off and do their own thing.', ""KATY: Yeah. \xa0I have seen the idea of play-based learning, the need for play over and over again. And I think what might be happening is the idea that because we associate play with toys, that therefore toys are the facilitator of play. Even though you find play in modern hunter-gatherer populations that don't have toys that play is more a state of mind. The set of requirements placed upon someone else. Like the idea what you're doing has to be productive. Has to be done in a certain way, to me that's what makes something not playful. So if you're looking to facilitate play-based learning, you can do that entirely in nature with things that ... or inside the house using pine cones and things that you gather and plant. So you can facilitate play based learning without toys. We have a similar thing here. Toys are not a big part of our household. Because I think that anything that you can get from a particular toy, you can get from a natural counterpart and then not only get the skill that that toy would facilitate, also becoming more competent, familiar with things from nature as well as not requiring the production or the purchase of something - a non-essential. I think there's also this idea that we teach rather than we model. So if you're looking to create play-based learning in nature, that oftentimes is going to require that you are prioritizing nature education for yourself. Nature play for yourself. And when you go out and do it then I have a hard time keeping my children from whatever I am doing. The number one way to keep them away from me and what I'm doing is to invite them to come do it and tell them that it's something they should do. \xa0You know what I mean."", 'DONIGA: Yeah.', 'KATY: I found that\'s the equation. If I say ""come outside with me and let\'s build this structure or let\'s dig this thing,"" because I need to do this work or whatever. It\'s like, ""Eh. I don\'t want to. I want to just sit inside here and read these books or these flashcards"" or whatever. Then I\'ll say, ""I\'m gonna go outside I\'ll see you guys later."" And 5 minutes later they\'re right there saying, ""What are you doing? Can we help?"" So maybe play based toys can be shovels and sticks for digging and making, identifying, or cutting different plants. So there are tools but a tool, the label of a tool becomes when you need to use it for a job. A tool becomes a toy when you get to do whatever you want with it. \xa0So I think that those ideas of play, and toys, and tools, it\'s all, those labels might be keeping you from getting the thing that you want, Denee, which is more learning and more nature. \xa0Right? So those would be my suggestions. Buckets go a long way.', 'DONIGA: \xa0Mmhmm.', ""DONIGA: \xa0Yeah, well it's my first time at the conference. \xa0And from the looks of it it's a conference that really works in the sphere of leadership in the media and how we can all recharge as we go out and do great things in the world. So I actually was invited as a part of a certified grass-fed cattle rancher with the American GrassFed Association. And so there's a big focus, this year, at "", "" on how we can look towards nature's built-in carbon sink, which is our soil. So we could look towards the basic principles of biology, of photosynthesis, and the root structures and the rhizosphere, billions of organisms that are in the soils that are all working towards pulling carbon out of the atmosphere to store long-term in the soils. And that happens with green growing plants all the time. So it doesn't happen in cities. It happens in nature or in any type of plants. It can happen in cities if we built rooftop gardens and have a lot of green spaces. But overall there's a much larger percentage of this carbon sink sort of solution to climate change happening on our farms and ranches. And how could we make farms and ranches more regenerative giving more life whether above ground or in the soil than the like that we essentially farm or ranch in the form of food? So I'll be joined on a panel with the author of the book Fist to the Ground which our family is featured in. And we'll also be on another panel with other ranchers that are doing similar work. And I'm just excited to meet folks and just see how we can all collaborate more because it seems like there's so many different movements and a lot of times it's hard to find the time to really kind of crossover to a different group of people and find the commonalities and how we can all in a sense lift each other up."", 'KATY: Right.

So I can either use the mop which has been designed to reduce movement  - to make it so that my arms just tense and hold the mop. You know, to make it all shoulders. And my ankles and my knees and my hips aren't really doing anything. Or I can just grab a warm rag and just squat all over the place and clean it up. And I found it was actually faster.  Not only was it faster than using a mop, it didn't require that I had a plastic mop. And I got to do basically the exercises for my hips and knees and ankles and shoulders and back, while I was cleaning the floor. "", 'KATY: Stack your life', ""KATY: Well, squatting is another... it's important because it's one of those - not everyone does every single move. Even if we were talking about humans, throughout human history, there were moves that I'm sure were regional or seasonal, but, you know, everyone was gonna squat down to go to the toilet at least a couple times a day. I feel pretty comfortable putting it into that group of moves that would make a regular appearance as being kind of an essential movement. It's also the movement that most people struggle with the most. Because chair sitting and not using those ranges of motions, it's kind of is a use it or lose it situation. So it's actually not a squat advent. It's a squat prep advent."", ""KATY: Meaning, the squat is coming.  But more towards the end. So we're gonna be working our way up towards it which means you're gonna be moving the pieces..."", 'KATY: It depends on the organization. I haven\'t decided. We might even go around it a couple of times.  That we\'re gonna be taking out the individual pieces of the body to kind of work on them. But also show you that a squat is a category of a lot of different things. So you\'ll find something kind of for everyone in there. Certainly, we all have ranges of possible movement because of our structure or our lives or our days, so I always try to think about that as much as possible to make sure that everyone can find something to do for themselves as they look through this advent. So it\'s just, it\'s an integral piece. It moves a lot of you, right? It moves your ankles, knees, your hips, your back, your pelvic floor. It actually moves your whole spine and your shoulders and your head and you\'ve got balance that you have to deal with. So it\'s just a fast, complex movement that I think a lot of people have symptoms of a lack of particular input. So the payoff of doing even a portion of it is particularly high. So I often tend to pick movements where they\'re easy nutrients for people. You know, like, the calf stretch is, ""hey this one thing that I did really filled in a lot of movement nutrition things for me.  Where I noticed a lot of symptoms and lack of movement go away from the small investments."" I think the squat\'s another one of those.', ""KATY: Right. I mean if you even thought about the things you're experienced as relating to your movement at all, which there are so many things that we don't. But then other things that are more obvious that we easily correlated to the overall movement of the musculoskeletal system. The squat isn't always as obvious. Because I think people think of the squat as something for their quads or something for their butt."", ""KATY: They don't think of it as a whole body movement."", 'KATY: No, no, exactly. It\'s just gotten really tiny in our minds is what it\'s good for. My quads are fine, I don\'t need to squat and I\'m like, ""Well, maybe you do.""', 'KATY: Yeah', ""KATY: Yeah. And we're gonna experience all kinds of different squats. So I'm gonna play with, I really want to dial it in that squatting is a category. And that includes going up stairs.

I mean what's a squat if it's like, isn't that just lowering yourself down closer to the ground?"", ""KATY: You're doing squats all day long. It's just that the range of motion for them is to the chair or back."", ""KATY: Almost everyone squats. If you're using a chair..."", ""KATY: You're squatting. If you're getting down into the chair and out of the chair, you're squatting. So that's already kind of broadens your mind to like, yeah, everyone's working out. Everyone is exercising and moving. It's just through a really tiny ranges of motion. So we're gonna play with that as our advent."", 'KATY: You should have seen my face when you said that it was felt. I actually had a ... oh!', 'KATY: I one time bought, I once bought an advent ...', 'KATY: Uh, no I would not.

When you put your foot up..."", ""KATY: And you go to step, you look down while you're doing it. You might find that your knee travels really far forward to get the next foot up. So if you step up with your left foot, you plant your left foot on the step. And then you ride that leg forward six or eight inches..."", 'KATY: If you look down, you\'ll say, ""Oh my whole body is traveling towards the step>\'  And then your other foot comes.  And put the next foot in front of you.  So when you\'re taking the stairs that way, there\'s a tremendous amount movement of your body towards the staircase. Not necessarily up the staircase.', 'KATY:  The forward motion can be handled by your geometry. If you just put one foot up and then step straight up. And then put your next foot up and then just step straight up, you would be using more of your back side. You would be squatting more using the back side to come up out of a squat versus using the front of your thighs or your knees to come up. So most people are trying to work on using less of their knees and building more instead muscle and strength on their backside. So one way you can make over going up and down those steps is to reduce that forward travel of your knee.', ""KATY: So you're gonna practice keeping the knee fixed. Right over the ankle and then just step straight up as you come up the steps. So there's gonna be a lot of that. A lot of video I imagine. because squats and be pretty technical once you start playing with these subtle... managing your geometry in a really subtle way."", ""KATY: Exactly. And also doing your holiday prep work if you have celebrations at this time, doing it on the floor. And integrating various squat positions for your toes and your ankles and your knees. If you're in community with children or animals or other people, how to use them as props. So you're kind of getting the connection. you know it's not just you and your exercise.

So I’ve asked them to join me here to talk about the movement in what they do.

To most people, the silent winter trunks of a hardwood forest are dull blocks of frozen wood. To me, they are pregnant, powerful, delicious. There is something magical about sugar water running from a hole in a tree—the millions of gallons of sweet sap silently working its way skyward through the hard trunks of a maple grove. Sugaring turns the forager’s calendar on its head; that lull of late winter, when the woods seems to languish as it waits for spring, is for us tree-tappers the busiest and largest harvest of the year. We begin in deep snow, shoveling paths to the shack and hauling our pails and wood in sleds. We work through snow, sleet, rain, and more snow.” Uh!

So I guess for those who don't know, we'll just start with a little bit of background. And I just say that right now, everything that you're gonna talk about, even the questions that I'm asking, some of them I already know the answers to because I've already read your books and you've explained them beautifully. But I guess the podcast is an opportunity for people to, while getting something else done, maybe find portals into other life experiences that they'd like to have. So let's just talk a little bit about your journey. Why did you begin foraging for wild food when you were a kid?"", ""SAM: You know I started really because I was hungry. \xa0My mother had 5 children and she really didn't like to cook. And so she made sure we had enough calories but we didn't have a very well rounded diet. And I was craving things all the time when I was a kid. I wanted more than oatmeal and hot cereal and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. So I learned to garden at a very young age. I learned to steal things from my neighbors garden at a very young age. I learned to help my neighbors their gardens and get things without stealing. And I learned to eat crab apples and plums and apples and pick butternuts and black walnuts in my neighborhood. And that grew into this hobby of foraging which to me as a child was simply eating. And didn't separate the methods of food procurement that I had. Eventually, I learned that there was books on this topic. And that opened up this whole new world to me. All of a sudden I didn't have to ask my dad or my grandmother or my teachers or somebody working in their garden what a certain plant was or whether or not something could be eaten. I could just look it up in a book. And it made it so much faster to learn this stuff. So that's kind of the process by which I got into foraging at 4 or 5 years old."", 'KATY: So did you have any mentors outside of your, like you mentioned your dad and your grandma, or are you completely self-taught or just picking up one thing here or there simply through books?', ""SAM: You know as a young child I did not have any mentors. I mentioned my father because he taught me two or three plants that he knew. He taught me butternuts, for example. But by no means would I say my dad was a forager or a mentor in that hobby. \xa0My grandmother was 600 miles away. Yet if she was closer would have taught me a lot more stuff. I didn't even realize until I was an adult how much she really knew. But she did teach me some wild edibles and I loved to visit her. Which was a once a year event, generally, when I was a child. But I really never had a mentor until I was about 15. A girl I dated in high school, her dad was a forager and he and I went out together - I think he was more of a peer than a mentor though. But he did teach me a lot of stuff and I taught him a lot of stuff and we had a lot of fun together for a few years collecting all kinds of wild stuff. But for the most part, I learned what I learned either through books or more importantly, I learned from the plants themselves. \xa0And people often forget that everything that is known about a plant that you can find in books was originally, if it is true, learned by a person observing the plant. And you can go out there and do this yourself. And the knowledge that you can acquire that way is not limited by what other people have done in the past. So most of what I do now is observing the plants themselves and trying to figure out where they grow and why they grow there and how they grow. When you're talking about food, you're relying on traditions because millions of millions of people for thousands of years have undergone these experiments to determine what is safe and how something is used. And it's very nice to stand on their shoulders when you're engaging in foraging. I'm not eating random plants and just tasting them. But there are a lot of clues that you learn that tell you that a plant it worth investigating."", ""KATY: So you're saying that there's more to know. Are you suggesting that there's more to know than what we know?"", ""SAM: There is so much more to know. There is cultural knowledge that has been lost, that's disappeared. Or it's buried somewhere where very few people know it. And there's also things that are not just discovered yet. \xa0And to me, that's just so exciting."", 'KATY: Yeah. The reason you write books, do you think that that is in part due to the impact of books on your life?', 'SAM: It is partly. And it is also a pretty efficient way to reach a lot of people. I can take a group of people out on a weekend and I can have a group of maybe 12 or 16 people spend the weekend with me and I can teach them a lot of stuff but the book is just a much more efficient way to teach people and I want to put that down somewhere so that 70 years from now somebody can take that book out, as I have been doing, with 70-year-old books and see what I said about a particular plant.', ""SAM: \xa0It's fun. I mean the same reason that somebody wants to go for a walk in the park. The same reason someone wants to go look at the waterfall when they visit Yellowstone. I mean it's just this intrinsic draw. \xa0I don't even generally to try to explain it. \xa0If I want to think of some logical reasons that I like to gather, I could think of a lot of great reasons. I mean, I think it's the absolute best food in the world. And today because I have a lifetime of eating these foods, I crave them. So I may crave salsifying shoots. Well, there's no way I'm going to get them unless I go harvest them. You simply can't buy them. There's all kinds of things in my yearly cycle that I crave and I will never be able to get them unless I go gather them myself. I can save money, but that's a not real big part of why I forage. But at times in my life, it has been very important. \xa0I love cooking and I can cook things with top-notch ingredients that no one else gets to cook with and make really exciting and interesting and healthy foods out of the ingredients that I gather for free. So, and I also just love being in nature and doing stuff. And that's what foraging is. It's being in nature and doing stuff. The stuff that our ancestors have done for countless generations."", ""SAM: Foraging turns every place into a theme park. The whole world is a botanical theme park. You could go anywhere and have some interesting plants to look at. Interesting interactions to see in how the plants and the insects and the birds and the other animals are, I'm stumbling over my thoughts or stumbling over my words, but you can go anywhere and look at what's happening in nature and it's exciting. For someone into plants, every alley, every roadside ditch, every vacant lot has exciting plants to find. And that's not an exaggeration. \xa0I mean you can go to roadsides and find a plant that's never been recorded from this particular state without too much effort. So ... and foraging is good for your brain. It's what your brain was meant to do: to look very closely and carefully at the landscape in a broad scale but also at the small details that you were mentioning. Foraging gets your brain to look at all levels of your surroundings and to think about how they interact and this interaction is exceedingly complex. \xa0And that's what our brains were designed to do and that's why our brains are so good at so many things. Because this natural world that we've developed in is so complex. And is so variable."", 'KATY: Well just to go back with what you said about every lot ... So I have little kids. I know that you have little kids too. I know a lot of people listening to this are trying to figure out how to get more nature education for themselves. More plant knowledge for themselves - for their families. But not everyone lives in, you know, really close to wild areas so their access to doing this really seems shut off at the gate. Because it\'s like ""well I don\'t live on a million acres of national forest"" like I do. I don\'t own a million acres. I just happen to be butted up against it. \xa0Not everyone has this opportunity to, in their minds, engage in the natural way of moving through the natural world. But I like to point out, and I think as you just pointed out, there are so many elements of nature and of natural movement and of foraging to be found wherever you are. I mean there are community gardens. And lots. Lots full of growing things. But it does require that you change how much you pay attention -that you seek out some of these spaces. \xa0So is there anything else you can suggest for someone who is like, ""I would love to do all the things you\'re talking about but I feel like there\'s no way this applies to me."" \xa0Is there one thing that everyone could likely find or one way that most people could move through almost any landscape and a diverse set of financial or time constraints?', ""SAM: You know everybody has access to wild food that they can gather. \xa0And the landscapes may not be natural but the natural plants and animals are always trying to take back these human-disturbed places. And they're always thriving. Some of them are always thriving there. It doesn't matter how big of a city you live in or where you are. There's something to forage. And the plants that grow in urban areas tend to be quite uniform across the country. Even across the world. If you were to be in Stalingrad during the summer you are going to find some similar plants to what you're going to find in Hamburg Germany or in New York City or in Detroit. So it's, the ubiquitous weedy plants like amaranth and purslane and lambs quarters, dandelion, black nightshades. These things are found in a remarkable array of habitat and region as long as the ground is disturbed."", 'SAM: You know, I have a philosophy. \xa0It\'s that somatic energy is really important. That as soon as we abandon our bodies as a tool we make ourselves irrelevant. \xa0And it makes sense that human beings naturally try to avoid physical labor because there\'s this equation of calories in and calories out. So you try to get your food in the easiest possible way. So you try to get the most calories for the least caloric output. That\'s a way that generally animals, including humans, live by. In the modern world, we have made access to calories so easy that if we follow those instincts we will simply not give ourselves the physical activity that we need. So we desperately avoid exertion. If you look at the way that we think of physical labor, it is almost invariably considered suffering and a sign of poverty. And we need to get over this. We need to get past this. So I do a lot of things because I like the physical activity and I designed my life in such a way that I use as few machines as possible. I make maple syrup the old-fashioned way: by carrying buckets of sap. \xa0And it is hard work.And I won\'t lie where there\'s a couple times a year where I think, ""man, I am exhausted. I am tired.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'SAM: \xa0""And I am sick of this."" But you know what? That\'s part of being human. You need to be hungry sometimes. You need to be tired sometimes. \xa0You need to be exhausted sometimes. And sore. And I mean the good kind of sore. So there is work but variable work. Sometimes very hard work involved in using wild food. And I think that\'s great. I mean, I\'m a marathon runner and I love long distance running. But I don\'t run a lot or train much during wild ricing season because it is just as hard as running is and it takes as much out of me and so if I\'m spending 6 hours on the water harvesting wild rice, then I\'m probably not going running after I go ricing that day.', 'KATY: So this makes me think of something else I want to ask you. \xa0So, just like every, let\'s call it a plant. \xa0Every plant that you harvest is going to be unique in its, in the nutrients, in the dietary nutrients you can extract from it once you put it in your mouth. But could you, I don\'t know, three and if three\'s too many we can drop to two, but can you think of three different plants that have radically different mechanical nutrients or that vary in the diversity of movements required to harvest them so that someone who hasn\'t harvested wild foods can get a sense of ... like maple syrup is one. You could break it down into bucket hauling and then whatever else you have to do to turn the sap eventually into syrup. So you\'ve got chopping wood and what not. If we come up with three different foods can you come up with the movements for those three foods so that the listener can get a sense of ""Oh I see..."" That we\'ve been thinking of food in terms of their end: the way they affect our body after someone has done all the labor and they put it into their mouth. But if we were doing the work for our sugar and the work for our starches and the work for acorn or something, that they could get a sense of the geometry configurations and think about it in those terms.', ""SAM: Sure. \xa0Sure. So I mean, I'll take the examples I already mentioned. I could start with wild rice. One of the physical things I'm doing that really feels great is I lift that canoe up, carry it on my shoulders and carry it to the lake. And that may be anywhere from 100 yards. Sometimes it's 3/4 of a mile from where I park my vehicle. And then there's hauling my finished bags of rice back. They're usually about 60 pounds a bag after I unload them from the canoe and I hoist them on my shoulder and carry them back one at a time. So there can be a lot of walking there. When I'm actually out on the water, I harvest rice, sometimes with a partner. Usually my wife or her father or sometimes alone but this involves standing in the canoe which is great for your balance. And of course, when you're balancing standing in a canoe you're using your lower leg muscles and your feet muscles in variable ways to keep your balance."", ""KATY: It's like stand up paddling. Stand up paddling would be the athletic equivalent to one element of rice harvesting."", ""SAM: Yeah. Except instead of paddling I'm using a pole."", 'KATY: Right. Ok.', ""SAM: And the mechanics and the motions of pushing with that pole are too complex to explain over the phone but it's a difficult skill. It's like riding a bicycle. It takes people a while to get it. So you know you have a 14-16 foot pole and you are pushing the canoe forward with it and trying to at the same time control where the canoe goes to get it exactly where you want it in the proper position in the rice. And you know, there's a lot of upper body work and a lot of mid-body work to adjust how you're transferring the energy from your pole through your body to the canoe to get it to turn a particular way and to move it forward. And the act of knocking the rice, which is what we call getting the wild rice into the canoe, if I'm ricing with a partner and I'm only knocking rice at a particular time, you're reaching out with one arm to draw the rice closer to the canoe. You have a cedar stick about 30 inches long in one hand and then you have a cedar stick in your other hand that comes in behind it and swipes the rice so that it knocks the ripe and lose kernels off of the stalks into the canoe. And it's very much a dancing like motion. You're making this knocking motion about once every second to a second and a half. It depends on how thick the rice is and how tall the rice is. But you'll do that for, say an hour and forty minutes and then switch places. So this is an aerobic, fairly intense aerobic exercise that's using different muscles than running but the breathing is heavy. Like long-distance running. So that's most of what's done for the harvest of rice, but then we have the processing to get the rice out of the hulls, where we parch the rice, usually about half a bushel at a time in a 30-gallon copper kettle and you're stirring that while you're parching it. So that's another different motion in your body. And the most physically demanding part of it is what they call dancing the rice which is getting the hulls off by rubbing them with your feet. So after the rice is parched enough to make the hulls brittle and to burn off the very tips of the awns which are sharp and dangerous, then you put that in an oak barrel. It's a 13 to 15-gallon barrel typically - at least the way that I dance the rice. And you have some deer hide leggings, they're like moccasins with a long top. You place your feet, you kind of alternate pressure from one foot to the other. You twist your body so that the rice is twisted under your foot in between your foot and the bottom of the barrel. And you do that repeatedly at a fast pace. And it's one of these things where the energy you put in directly corresponds to the work you get done. So the faster and harder you work the sooner you get the hulls rubbed off your rice."", 'KATY: Actually earning your food through your movement.', ""SAM: Yes. And after that, you winnow the rice which is, takes a lot of hand/eye coordination and is not physically very strenuous but you're moving around. But there is no extremely difficult activity to it but it's kind of a more relaxing motion. So typically this was a social activity and maybe one person out of eight or ten would be dancing the rice at any one time and might do that for 20 minutes, 25 minutes, whatever it takes to get that batch ready. And then they would take a rest and then take a turn at winnowing the rice or stirring the rice in the kettle. So there's a whole bunch of stuff to getting your wild rice ready to eat. I don't know, was that too long or?"", ""KATY: No. \xa0I think that's helpful. There's just a lot of information coming out now about the strengths of I think European women 5000 years ago and looking at their bones and accessing their strength from the shape of their bones and the connective areas of their muscles. \xa0These women here just through the processing of their food, had stronger bones than athletes now simply because the amount of work is so intense and also I don't think it's too long because I'll write a lot and try to explain a lot about the work of food and the diversity of motions for food, but I don't, I've never harvested and made rice. So it's all very theoretical. I understand the motions. But I think, again, you are living in a way that gives you first-hand knowledge and I guess more credibility to explain it. So that's exactly what I was after. What would be, I would say, if we're looking at the nutrients, the movement nutrients, of one. What other plant would be the compliment to that one in terms of using your body much differently?"", ""SAM: Well certainly with maple syrup there's almost none of the same motions. This time of year, usually one day a week, I'm making firewood to get ready for syrup season. And I cut with a chainsaw. That's pretty hard physical labor even though people think the saw is doing all the work but there's still a lot of work to operate that saw."", ""KATY: I've never chainsawed anything if you think it's easy."", ""SAM: People that haven't used a chainsaw are often shocked at how physically strenuous it actually is to operate a chainsaw for a while. And then I'm hauling that wood. Usually in a sled, pulling it behind me. Splitting it and stacking it and that's all pretty hard work but very different motions. And then of course during sap season, I'm - after I get the whole sugar bush set up by drilling the trees - tapping in the spigot, hanging the buckets. Then it's fairly regular carrying buckets which is probably the most physically strenuous part of my year ... during that intense part of maple syrup season because there's times when I work 16 or 18 hour days and half of that is carrying buckets. So I might walk the equivalent of 16 miles in a day with two full or nearly full 5-gallon buckets half of the time. So very different muscle groups. And when I'm doing that type of intense work I have to really think about the ergonomics of what I'm doing or I'm going to get sore or I'm going to get repetitive motion injuries which is a fact of life that I don't think the motion injuries but that you have to think about them when you're really exerting yourself. And I'm not saying that anybody needs to do this to the extent that I do it. I make maple syrup and harvest wild rice as part of my income. It would be the same type of activity just less of it if I was just making it to feed myself."", 'So, for those that don’t know, the elements, the elements of a shoe and this is all covered in', ' That book goes may more into shoes, as opposed to ', ' which goes way more into feet. So for ', ', the elements of a minimal shoe are: A zero-rise heel which means that the back of the shoe is at the same height as the front of the shoe, flexible sole, and flexibility can be determined in multiple directions. So if you pick up your shoe, you might be able to bend it front to back, but it might not twist as well. So there\'s multiple planes that you can evaluate for flexibility, Wide tox box, which means the front of the shoe, can you spread your toes away from each other. A fun way to do this is to put your foot on a piece of paper, spread your toes as far away from them as they go, trace your foot and then put your shoe over on top of it. I just did this with my daughter the other day. And she thought it was hilarious because I was showing her in her favorite pair of dress-up shoes that she swears are not too small. It\'s like, ""Don\'t take my word for it. Use the math."" \xa0Full upper; so the upper is the part of the shoe that connects the foot to the bottom of the shoe. So if you\'re putting on a trainer, a boot, a shoe, that where your whole foot is encased, that\'s a full upper. That being said, so is a sandal that maybe wraps around your heel and over your toes as well. So it doesn\'t have to - a full upper doesn\'t mean that it has to be fully covered or protected from the sun or the wind, it\'s that the work that your foot has to do is minimal in keeping the shoe on. So again, in ', "" I talk about a flip-flop only has two thin straps that come over, thus it's a pretty minimal upper. But to keep the shoe on, you have to flex, you have to contract all of your toes while you are walking to keep it from slipping off. So that is not an upper that connects your foot very well to the shoe. You have to put in a lot of geometry changes and muscular force to keep the shoe on while you're walking. It's like extra movement and movement in a way that over time can actually create lots of tensions and a shortening of those toes. Hammertoes, you can google a picture of what I mean by kind of creating a rigidity of shape because you're recruiting that way of walking over and over again. Take that same flip-flop though and add a strap that goes around your ankle, so again the mass that you're adding to the shoe isn't very much but because of the engineering, now doesn't require that you grip your toes. Meaning your foot can stay completely relaxed for just that little bit of mass added. And you can have a relaxed foot. Now you have a fuller upper. You could even be considered a minimal upper, or an upper that qualifies for minimal shoe status because you don't have to do any work to keep your shoe on. \xa0And then one more, a lack of toe spring. So if you put all of your shoes on a table and measured the height of your toe box above the ground. If you see that that's rising up - a lot of shoes have a little swoop in the front - that's called toe spring. We would not want to have that. We would want the front of your foot to be able to rest on the ground and not be permanently elevated. I only used to have four elements of minimal shoe for those of you who read the first edition of "", ' to Foot Pain Relief but ', ', who created Correct Toes, he has this toe spring, and wrote me about toe spring as an element that he uses. And I was like yes, of course. We will add that to the book. So the new edition has that fifth. So if you\'ve only read up on the fourth, make sure you\'ve read up on that fifth one. So those are the elements of a minimal shoe. So it\'s a continuum, right? \xa0You can have everywhere from a super structured shoe and a high heel and a sole that doesn\'t flex and a very narrow toe box, and it can also be a flip-flop, and can also have your toes up at the front, which would be a fun contest to design. But a minimal shoe is on a continuum. And you can also add other elements, which is exposure to sun, exposure to air. Because there are so many differences between our shoes and feet that I am only putting five. You could add more. Which ones are most important really depends on the experience that you are currently having with your feet. So it\'s not as easy as saying make sure you have x or y and ranking them in importance as a global statement. Their importance really relates back to you and your personal needs. You can have a minimal shoe that is completely flat and a thin flexible sole but maybe what you do with your body is stand in place. Like I\'ll get emails from a lot of nurses or people who have to stand for long period, baristas, people that stand for long periods of time on their feet on hard flat surfaces in which case that minimal shoe in that context actually isn\'t serving them all that well. And they\'ll be like, ""I really feel like I need to add cushion."" And I\'m like, ""Yeah you do."" You need to add cushion. So if you want to keep that flat and flexible element you want to look for something that\'s beefed up and cushioned a little bit and minimize that geometry. So this is why I really recommend that rather than memorizing or learning the characteristics of the shoe, you learn how each characteristic of the shoe affects your body so that you can then rank them in order. For me, or if I were to say if everyone was going to make one small change, the altitude of heel would be probably the easiest. That being said, if someone is having a lot of pressure on the front of the foot or the toe gripping or the toes is a thing, it might warrant you to be addressing the front of your toe box. Then again, if your heel is putting a lot of pressure on the front of your foot in that narrow shoe, then again the heel is the most important. So if you\'re only going to address one thing, the heel is probably going to be the easiest to address down in scale. \xa0What I would recommend is going and pulling out the 3 pairs of shoes you wear the most often and give them a rank. Again, in ', ' there\'s a grid to help you do this. Score your shoes. And go, ""you know what? I notice that maybe I have a range of heel height. Maybe I do spend quite a bit of time in flats and maybe I have the heels for some time but I\'ve noticed that all my shoes have a narrow toe box."" In which case for you, your current footwear selection, really never allows for that one type of movement, of moving the front of your foot, that would be the piece for you to add. If having the flat heel and very malleable sole you\'re noticing, ""My feet - I don\'t have time to add a lot of foot strengthening stuff and now the extra malleability is creating a stress riser somewhere in my foot or I\'m noticing that my foot isn\'t strong enough to deal with it then that thickness - or not thickness - but the stiffness of the sole could be a nice bolster for you while you get other elements of minimal. So again this is up for you to determine. It really depends on your physical experience and what you would be transitioning to minimal shoes for. If you go to the beginning of ', "" there's a place where I ask you to write out the things - your physical experience - to help you quantify it a little bit where you can then start to maybe correlate your footwear to various other elements that aren't always within the foot. Some people have issues with their feet. Some people don't. But they have issues with their knees, or their hips, or their bone, and they can learn how footwear affects that and they can learn how that footwear affects that and can start picking the element that's most crucial for you. So, sorry my answer is, it depends and it's up to you to determine it. But isn't it great that it's something that you can learn and determine? \xa0Let's get back to the interview. Thanks again to Unshoes, as well as Earthrunners, "", ', ', ', and ', ' I really appreciate your support and I hope the listeners are loving these questions that are inserted into our podcasts. Go check out their websites. Ok, back to Sam.', 'SAM: Oh yes.', 'KATY: What would be one.', ""SAM: So, I mean one thing I like about picking nuts whether it's acorns or hickory nuts or walnuts is I sit on the ground. I'm kind of crawling on my hands and knees and often with hickory nuts I have a tub that I slide around on the ground and then I'm picking up as fast as I can with my free hands and then I quickly dump them in the bucket. I'm kind of pivoting in a circle where my knees are the center of the radius and when I clear that area then I maybe scoot over one hop or drag my knees just a few feet and then kind of start the process over again. So when I'm collecting hickory nuts I may spend several hours on the ground on my hands and knees crawling around, scooting around, and picking these nuts off the ground. \xa0And also when I harvest ground beans, I rake, I have a very small curved digging stick that is in my right hand and I rake the surface of the ground with that digging stick and I pull the beans out as they're exposed with my left hand. So quite different motions there. And those tend to be things I can do for a very long time without feeling sore or even particularly tired. \xa0But they're good low-level cardio activity that lasts all day long."", ""KATY: Yeah. And I think it's also, many people perceive that the only way to get cardio is through doing a cardio exercise. Right? Like running or jumping. There are these kinds of repetitive low impact carrying heavy load ways of cardio which I also like to remind people, means that you're moving your, the muscles around your ribcage. The alignment of how you take in a breath, you're basically changing the mechanics of how you breathe and the flow of your blood that that's what happening when you do cardio. It doesn't necessarily have to do with what you're doing on the outside of your body. It's referring to what's going on in the inside of your body. So I was going to ask you what you love about using hand tools but I think you have probably already answered it. Like what is your favorite hand tool? What's under your pillow you like it so much?"", ""SAM: What's my favorite hand tool? \xa0I mean... I actually like hand tools because they make life simpler. Unless you use a tool a lot, I mean, a power tool can be just a hindrance and an annoyance in my view. But I've got a hammer my brother gave me when I turned 18 and I love that thing. We call it the porcupine hammer because porcupines like to chew on tools and the thing was almost brand new and a porcupine chewed up the handle pretty good but the amount of work that I've done with that hammer in my life is kind of ridiculous. But I have, I've got a kitchen knife that I really love, and I've got a hunting life that I love. I've got a hatchet that I love and I've got a shovel that I love. I've got a lot of hand tools. You spend a lot of time with a particular tool and you just grow attached to it. It becomes like an extension of your body."", 'KATY: Yeah. Ok, how important would you say that your identity as a forager is to the way that you understand the world? Can you even separate them?', 'SAM: No. I mean, yeah, I view the world through different eyes than most people.', ""KATY: Which I love about you. Which is the best reason to get all of your books. If you want to learn a different way to see the world, read your books. I'll just throw that in there. Go ahead."", 'SAM: I consider that fully a positive thing that I see the world through the eyes of a forager. I look at the landscape and I don\'t see just a jumbled mass of greenery. I see wild grapevines with carrion flower growing through it and think, ""Oh there\'s probably rabbits in there.""', 'SAM: Well, I encounter two different forms of resistance to foraging. One, people who claim that it\'s damaging to the environment. And the second is people\'s fear of foraging: fear of poisoning themselves. And with both types of resistance I want people to know that I\'m on their side. I\'m not trying to promote irresponsible foraging that is likely to result in somebody getting poisoned and I\'m not interested in foraging that\'s going to be harmful to the environment. So I let people know right off the bat, ""I know your concern."" \xa0And then I can say, ""but here\'s the truth."" \xa0And with the fear of poisoning, this is, there\'s a very good reason we\'re afraid of poisoning ourselves and that\'s because we come from thousands of generations of food gatherers and we have a built-in instinct that tells us that we need to only eat a plant if we know what it is. And when you actually go out and forage, that instinct expresses itself in exactly that way. It says don\'t eat this, you don\'t know what it is. \xa0Very healthy way. Very helpful way. \xa0But for people who don\'t forage, you have an instinct that is boiling over, that\'s trying to come out. It\'s trying to express itself. But it doesn\'t know how to express itself because these people no longer engage in the activity that the instinct was designed for. So it comes out in these absurd irrational ways basically fear of food itself. Fear of plants themselves. Fear of nature and mushrooms. And this is just ludicrous. And so I try to point out how statistically how incredibly safe wild food foraging is. There is one to three deaths a decade that arguably could be caused by plant misidentification in North America. That\'s almost unbelievably low when you consider that there are billions of people that engage in this activity. \xa0So it\'s remarkably safe and you just have to follow the simple rules. Know what it is before you eat it and know that it\'s safe. \xa0And then we come to this idea that foraging is bad for the environment. \xa0I think it\'s equally absurd. Foraging can be practiced irresponsibly. \xa0But any activity can be practiced irresponsibly. \xa0It\'s really easy to forage responsibly. And it\'s actually pretty hard to forage irresponsibly. If you wanted to forage irresponsibly it would take extraordinary effort to do so. The amount of labor it would take would be such that you would have to have a really good reason to damage the environment through foraging. And that really good reason in most people\'s cases is money. So if you\'re not collecting a wild food to sell, there is almost no chance of people damaging the environment through foraging. I like to point out to people, ""You know that nature center you go to? And there\'s a parking lot, and some paved walking trails? Or mowed walking trails?"" The environmental impact of that parking lot, and that visitor center, and those hiking trails is far greater - a far greater negative impact on that nature center that if every person who came there went and collected some wild greens to leave before they left. We just, it\'s a silly cultural notion that eating from the landscape destroys it. Because our ancestors ate from this landscape for thousands and thousands of years and it remained vibrant and intact. And it\'s only when we decided to remove the native vegetation and replace it with a different, simplified system we call agriculture, that is where destroying nature in order to eat your food came into our life. Before that we ate nature and had nature at the same time because we were part of it.', ""KATY: Yeah. So you've done quite a bit of work to have this knowledge at your fingertips, literally. \xa0How are you facilitating... are you facilitating this with your own kids? I mean obviously all parents are modeling what they do but are you actively taking them out or do they go or do you go to other wild food classes? How are you making this a family thing, if you are?"", 'SAM: Well we just forage together. It\'s just, they don\'t realize... well that\'s not true. They\'re starting to realize now that this isn\'t normal but they were born into a foraging household. In fact, I had a guest a few days ago and we all sat down for breakfast and I cracked a bunch of hickory nuts and while the wild rice was cooking we all sat down, my wife, my two older children, and I and my guest and we all sat down and shelled hickory nuts. And he was mentioning how ""in our house, we could never get the kids to do this."" \xa0Well, I said, ""We don\'t \'get\' the kids to do this, this is just what we do."" \xa0There\'s no convincing involved. This is just what life is in our house. So we go pick blueberries or serviceberries or both every summer and we\'ll camp out and we will spend the whole day outside. \xa0And we will get as much food as we can. We\'ll also have a lot of fun. Might go chase a ground squirrel. Might find a turkey nest. We might find a lizard or a snake under a log and have a bunch of great experiences outside and get a bunch of blueberries and get a bunch of exercise and then go swimming at the end of the day. And this is just what life is. So I think it\'s really hard and not very effective to try to quote ""get children"" to do a particular thing or get them to learn a particular thing. \xa0I think it\'s really easy to do it yourself and have kids want to participate. In fact, I really believe that these mundane activities involved in foraging are such a part of the human path that we are instinctively drawn to it. If I get out a bucket of hickory nuts and am taking the husks off, and there\'s \xa0a group of people around, a whole bunch of people without any prompting from me are gonna sit down next to me, ask me what I\'m doing and then start shucking hickory nuts beside me. \xa0This happens to me every time any year. People are instinctively drawn to that, including children.', 'KATY: A lot of people will ask me, ""how much movement do I have to do to start identifying myself as a mover?"" \xa0When do I become a mover to which my answer is ""as soon as you.."" \xa0I mean, we\'re all movers but if you\'re thinking of transitioning to more movement as soon as you take any steps, literally or figuratively, or take steps towards this thing that you want to do on a larger scale, that\'s when you are it. It\'s like a headspace thing first and foremost. So for those people who are wondering, ""If I go out and I find this alley or go in my yard and find miner\'s lettuce or find dandelions, is the moment that I first gather these and throw them on my tacos or put them on my salad, am I now a wild food person or am I a poser?"" \xa0What does it take to become a wild food aficionado?', ""SAM: Well there's no such thing as a poser. \xa0I mean if you gather a thing and you eat it, then you've gathered that think and you've eaten it. And I don't place a value on the categories - am I enough of a gatherer to be considered a hunter-gatherer? \xa0I don't know. \xa0And I don't really care. It's just, the beauty of foraging is you start with one plant. Start with one plant usually that you already know but don't eat. I mean most people know some edible plants already. They just don't know how they're eaten or they haven't taken the steps of going and eating them. And so as soon as you know one plant, you can use that one plant. It isn't like learning a language where a couple words doesn't do you much good until you learn the grammar and the syntax and how they're put together. You can learn one plant and incorporate that one plant into your diet and then at the next convenient time you can learn the next plant. And you don't need to worry about where you fall in the hierarchy of foragers or how you need to categorize yourself."", ""KATY: Fluency not required. Right? If you want to take a step, just take a step. Right? That that's fine."", 'SAM: Absolutely.', ""KATY: It's enough. It's great. It's wonderful. You're good. And all those things."", 'SAM: Absolutely.', 'KATY: What are some really general harvesting guidelines?', ""SAM: Ok. As far as the sustainability of harvesting, plants come in different categories depending on what part you're using and what they are in the landscape. Plants that we consider weeds, you really don't need to worry about the amount that you harvest. Plants where you're collecting only the greens or only the seeds or only the fruit, there's not a big worry about overharvesting those. But when you get to digging up underground parts that's when you really need to understand the plant's ecology and how it's affected by that before you do that in any significant amount. As far as safety, I don't dwell on safety rules because this is not a dangerous activity. When people talk about fishing, they don't go on and on about fishing safety or tennis safety. It's not a dangerous activity. It's only people that don't forage imagine a certain level of danger. So I don't really have a bunch of safety guidelines other than know what the plant is before you eat it."", 'KATY: What about areas that are sprayed?', ""SAM: That's definitely a concern. So, in fact, the big concern used to be with lead from automobile exhaust and that is still a concern even though lead hasn't been in the gasoline for 30 or 40 years but it's somewhat superseded by the concern over herbicides and insecticides, both of which are really prevalent in use. So when you gather on property that you're familiar with; your own backyard, your alley in your neighborhood, you're likely to have a good bead on what's happening and whether or not there's any dangerous chemicals there but really well-manicured landscapes like golf courses and certain city parks and certain people's lawns, those are the kind of places where it can be dangerous to forage or agricultural land, if you don't know the status of that agricultural land. You just have to be aware use common sense but you don't want to eat herbicides or pesticides in your food. The bigger pitfall that I see with foraging for people that are getting into it has nothing to do with safety. IT's about culinary sensibility. People tend to think because I have identified this plant now I can use it as a food when in fact that is not how food works. Everyone who eats asparagus knows that there is a narrow time during the year when it is appropriate to harvest asparagus. There is an appropriate stage of growth. And every wild plant also has an appropriate stage of growth and you can have horrible recipes and horrible experiences with food if you are collecting the wrong part or the part at the wrong time when it simply isn't in the right stage to be eaten. And these things aren't going to be poisonous but nobody wants to eat a tough, old, woody, stalk or a bitter, tough, leaf covered with sand. So the quality of what you gather is really important to having a positive experience with foraging. You need to be picky if you're gonna like it enough to come back and do it again."", ""KATY: After talking to you I feel like I might need a wild food cookbook. What's your favorite wild food cookbook if you have one?"", 'SAM: \xa0I have an old one from the 70s called ', '. And I like that one. And I really like ', '. His recipes tend to be based on experience and well explained and have panned out quite well when I tried them. There\'s quite a few wild food cookbooks out there and I find that my cooking is so different than most people\'s cooking that it is hard for me to find a cookbook where I think ""Oh that fits into my kitchen real well."" Because I have set of ingredients that they may not have.', 'KATY: Well as far as the weeds go, I can just throw out there that some of the simplest recipes were simply throwing dandelions into a smoothie. My kids love dandelions. I remember reading in your book years ago, people say they\'re bitter, that bitter is not a flavor that anyone can be used to. A lot of cultures are used to bitter, we just tend to not like it. So we throw them in smoothies all the time. Which doesn\'t require any skill but it just kind of starts modeling ""hey, right out back in our backyard you guys got get the greens for what you\'re gonna make today."" Miner\'s lettuce, again, dandelions get chopped up and just get thrown raw into salads, tacos. That\'s not even hard cooking. And nettle is really great stir-fried. Again, that\'s a little oil, a little garlic. You do not have to become a culinary wizard and I\'ll link to other sources that you mentioned, Sam.', 'SAM: Yeah, I promote not haute cuisine for cooking with wild food. I promote base cuisine. Haute cuisine is what the royalty paid other people to prepare for them because it was not something that was labor efficient enough that people would make it for themselves. Whereas I promote using wild food in the really healthy ways that the commoners used to eat wild foods. The Mediterranean diet is based upon everyday use and lots of wild leafy greens combined with pork, and olive oil, and seafood. And that is a really really easy way to use wild food. And a lot of the recipes are so simple like the fried greens that you mentioned. So simple and so good and I could eat it day after day after day and not tire of it.', ""KATY: What's your favorite wild food to eat?"", ""SAM: Well it's really hard to compare classes of foods. "", 'KATY: Right.', ""SAM: Stuffing my face with berries off the bush. I probably like serviceberries, good service berries better than anything else. But wild strawberries are also...it's hard to compare. But I never gorge on wild strawberries. I don't get quite enough. As far as flavor, I love shagbark hickory nuts. They are just out of this world delicious. It's hard to compare with a wide range of produce types."", ""KATY: What's the hardest plant to forage of all plants? And not necessarily the entire process, you know if you're carrying heavy things, but minute to minute either the fact that they're so distributed far away from each other. Like we have wild strawberries here but there's also a ton of birds in this one open space where we are. So to find one or two requires so much movement in between. So if you were to compare a minute by minute of the gathering part, which would be the most challenging of all wild foods?"", ""SAM: So, the most labor intensive thing that I regularly set aside a lot of time to collect probably is wild strawberries. They're just so delicious that they're worth ... but every year the crop of different foods varies. And there's such variety of wild food available that I will collect what makes sense that particular year. We eat a lot of nuts in our household but we have a lot of options. We have hickory nuts, black walnuts, and hazelnuts and all of them in some years are in great quantity and other years they're hard to find. And also butternuts. \xa0\xa0So between those four nuts in our region, every year I'm gonna get at least one in a bumper crop - maybe two or three. And at least one usually fails in a year. So I try to collect the things that are the best use of my time."", ""SAM: Well that's true but also within a garden the weeds that volunteer themselves, they're mostly edible plants. There are a few things that grow in a garden that aren't edible, but it's one of the safest and headspace places to forage because there very few dangerous plants that volunteer as weeks and people garden and the vast majority of what grows in the garden in between your rows of vegetables is going to be food plant."", ""KATY: So what we're picking and throwing away is actually food."", 'SAM: \xa0Yes.', 'KATY: Labor free food to cultivate. You just have to gather.', ""SAM: Exactly. You can double the output of your garden. We actually, in our, we have a vegetable garden, an annual vegetable garden. And we actually have more weeds that we save some to go to seed and then we broadcast and distribute the seeds throughout the garden into the fall so that they come up thick next summer because it about doubles what we get out of our garden. So that's lambs quarters, amaranth, black nightshade, and I can't remember the fourth one."", 'KATY: Is it purslane?', ""SAM: Actually purslane doesn't do very good on our soil. We have just a bare little purslane in our garden. Black nightshade, amaranth, lambs quarters...I'm sorry I'm terrible."", ""KATY: That's alright."", ""SAM: Those three for sure I spread around the garden and then I'm harvesting them all the year long in between the garden vegetables."", ""KATY: There's not really any arguing that nature is abundant here. Ok, well I thank you very much for coming on. I'll tell everyone where we can find you here in a second. But do you want to leave us with any other bits of your wisdom?"", ""SAM: No, not that I can think of.

I\'m going to give just a brief lesson on breath mechanics. Ok, so let\'s just quickly break down breathing. So by breathing I mean the oxygen that you\'re pulling from outside of your body in through your nose and mouth that\'s making its way to your lungs. But before we even get to that point, I\'ll just remind you that the reason you\'re breathing is to deliver oxygen on the cellular level. So that\'s the end goal if there are end goals. That\'s the end goal of the process of what you pull in your mouth - it\'s not just what\'s coming in and out of your mouth. It\'s the fact that it\'s being delivered down to the cells and is being distributed by the cardiovascular system. Right? That\'s what the cardiovascular system is doing. That\'s why there\'s this relationship between how your heart and lungs are working together. But, so let\'s step back to breathing. Taking a breath. So you\'ve got your lungs inside of your thoracic cavity. So if you think of your torso as your thoracic cavity on top of your abdominal cavity on top of your pelvic cavity. Cavity meaning container or a hole. So you\'ve got walls to your thoracic cavity. Right? You\'ve got the top and you\'ve got the sides and you\'ve got the bottom. The bottom of your thoracic cavity is your diaphragm, the walls are, if you just move your hands up above your waist, you can kind of palpate around your ribcage. So you\'ve got your ribs and you\'ve got all of the musculature and connective tissue and skin. Right? So you have that whole space. And so in order to get oxygen to come from outside of your body in through your mouth and nose, your thoracic cavity has to increase in size. It has to get bigger. And when it gets bigger it reduces the pressure, right? It pulls oxygen in your body. And when you do that, the lungs change shape. So the lungs are inside of the thoracic cavity. And as you pull oxygen in, it\'s kind of going into the bag - if you imagine a balloon, your lungs are balloons. As oxygen comes in, the lungs themselves change shape. So you\'ve got a lot of things changing shape. So it\'s kind of a challenging leap but, as a biomechanist, I really think in terms more of shape and geometry than physiology. So an exercise physiologist and a biomechanist can be talking about the same thing but maybe the way they perceive what\'s happening is a little bit different. So when I think of breathing, I\'m thinking of the fact that your thoracic cavity is changing shape and that the lungs inside of it are changing shape. And there are different shapes that can occur. Because you can increase the volume of your thoracic cavity in different ways. And when we break down ways we tend to kind of make the models very simple. So I believe I taught this on a youtube video a long time ago. So you can think of your shoulders lifting up in front of your ears. And sometimes if I\'m really tense or stressed I\'ll watch myself breathe and I can see my rib cage kind of moving up towards my face. I can see my shoulders elevating up towards my ears. But my individual ribs themselves, the ribs that make up the rib cage, they can also rotate. And when they rotate, my shoulders don\'t have to come up. I can also make my thoracic cavity larger by each one of those rotating; they rotate, it\'s kind of hard to explain it using audio versus visual. I usually use my body. But it\'s kind of similar to, I\'ve heard blinds used as an analogy. If you\'re twisting the handle on blinds, they\'ll flap up and flap down. It\'s kind of like that except they\'re not all stacked in series. When they flap open, the one that flaps open is not sitting directly beneath it. It\'s kind of displaced outwards. And when that one flaps open, the circumference of your rib cage is greater. And when each one of those ribs are doing that you end up with a greater circumference to your ribcage. So you change the volume of your thoracic cavity. Because each one of those ribs has kind of flared outward. So your rib cage, if you had a measuring tape around it with each breath, you would see that the circumference is getting bigger and getting smaller. Bigger, smaller. And then also you have a diaphragm, right? That is the bottom of your thoracic cavity. So the diaphragm if you imagine kind of a hump. Kind of like a mountain of flesh, it can contract and drop downward. Right? So then if you had a container where the bottom of it was filled by some of your diaphragm, then the diaphragm contracted and moved out of the way, then that would also give you more space in this room. \xa0It helps for me when I think of volumes to think about a room. Inside your thoracic cavity where your lungs live is a room. But the walls are all flexible. So you can get that to change shape to allow for more space for the lungs to deploy but something has to get out of the way. The diaphragm, the ribs, the shoulders up to your ears to kind of pull away from your diaphragm. Any one of those three things and really a combination of all three is how you would get your maximum volume change. So you\'ve got that changing shape of your thoracic cavity. But keep in mind that the way that the lungs change shape is gonna depend on the amount of oxygen that you breathe in. So a shallow breath is gonna move your lungs a little bit. A really big breath is gonna make your lungs - they kind of deploy down in your body, right? So if you\'re not really breathing a tremendous amount, then you\'re not gonna be working through your lungs (I\'m gonna put air quotes around this) ""range of motion."" So you have a range of motion of your lungs. In order to use the full range of motion of your lungs, you would want to be using your full range of motion of breath. And so that would, on one hand, be based on the volume that you\'re pulling in. You could look at it strictly as volume. So if you were carrying a ... if you were running up a mountain or walking and carrying sixty or seventy pounds, you\'re gonna need to pull in more oxygen. You\'re going to find that you are - the volume of oxygen that you\'re pulling in is greater. So that\'s one change in shape. But we also have this thoracic cavity need to change shape. And the way that your thoracic cavity changes shape depends on what it is that you\'re doing. So there\'s a lot of discussion going on right now about natural breath. What\'s natural breathing? That question from the yoga instructor. I\'m trying to understand natural breath. What happens during a natural breath. And it really depends on the context. Because, like I said, if I have my arms full of something and I\'m working very hard, or if I have one arm carrying a very heavy load but the other arm not, then the way my ribcage is going to change shape, the way my really my thoracic cavity really is changing shape, depends on what all my parts are doing. When the thoracic cavity changes shape, you know you\'re not just a floating thorax. You have an abdomen beneath you. So if the diaphragm moves down, right, that\'s one of the ways that you increase the volume of your thoracic cavity, when the diaphragm moves down, now you\'ve increased the pressure in the abdominal cavity. Right? So there\'s kind of a domino effect. And of course, everyone can deal with the diaphragm moving down in different ways. If you also, simultaneously, let the abdomen move forward. So I\'ve heard belly breathing is a term for this. So if you\'re diaphragm drops down and your abdomen moves forward, then you\'re not going to have necessarily that load then be continuously transferred down to your pelvic floor. But if you don\'t allow your abdomen to breath ... if you don\'t allow your abdomen to displace, the front of your abdominal musculature to relax and move forward, and that stays tense and then your diaphragm comes down, then there\'s a greater load placed on your pelvic floor which then would, all things being equal, create a response of your pelvic floor to tense.', '\n', '\n', ""Any time you increase the load to your pelvic floor it can respond back. So I can see very easily how the diaphragm moving down, in some individuals, would cause the pelvic floor to contract against that load. So there would just be an overall increase in abdominal or pelvic tension. But if you relax your abdomen, then you wouldn't necessarily see that pelvic floor tense. So I think we might be trying to oversimplify with what's happening during a natural breath because it depends on the state of all of the tissues. \xa0"", '\n', '\n', 'What we need is our heart and our lungs to be taken through a particular range of motions. Taken through their ranges of motions in the same way that I want to make sure that all my joints, my ankles ', ' my knees and my elbows and my shoulders, the way that I can keep all of those parts working well is by moving all of them fully. Which would mean through their full range of ', ' \xa0That if you are looking at what a natural breath is, in the same ', "" you would say what's natural shoulder use, that you would at this point, at least through the lens of some of the way that I describe movement, would kind of understand that the natural way of using your shoulders is not "", ' volume related, not only ""oh you need to be moving it multiple times a day and at a certain distribution"" but that there would be certain angles or certain motions that would be called upon. So, one of the reasons we have so many ways to breathe is so that you can be breathing while you\'re doing lots of motions.', '\n', '\n', ""So keep in mind that these questions and the way that we're forming our information about natural breathing mechanics and really all human mechanics is done currently in a completely sedentary culture. So the models of breathing that we're using is often in unmoving bodies with very low oxygen demand. Right? If you sit in a chair all day, in the same way that you use the ranges of motion of your knees and your hips in a repetitive way, you're using a repetitive breath shape. The volume that you're pulling in over and over and over again and the way that your thorax is changing shape and really your abdominal cavity and your pelvic cavity - it's all just very repetitive. You're just taking the same shallow breath. And why do you have a shallow breath? \xa0Because breath is coming in as fuel to the movement that you're doing. So it's not fuel in maybe the way that are used to thinking - caloric fuel. But it's part of the mechanism that allows moving to occur. So if you don't move very much, then you don't need that much breath. But obviously somewhere along the line we've recognized our need for breathing exercise in the same way that we've figured out we need to exercise our hips and exercise our shoulders, and exercise our spines, and exercise our feet. We're trying to take our breathing parts through their full range of motion in kind of a very unnatural context. Meaning in a natural model, your need for oxygen and these changes in shapes - what's happening to your pelvic floor and your abdominal musculature and the diaphragm and the muscles between the ribs - is dependent on the movement that you're doing. And so if we go back to me walking with something very heavy up a hill, my breathing shape, if I'm carrying a very heavy load on my back, is going to be a different breathing shape than if I have a very heavy load, that same load, only in my left arm. I'm gonna not be able to maybe have a full range of motion of my ribs on my left side if I'm holding in my left arm, so my right rib cage is gonna have to move more to still allow for that volume change. \xa0And then when I switch that load to my right arm, now because my right arm and the way that I'm holding it is influencing the leverage of all that right side, I'm gonna have to move the left side more. So again, breath, the shape of breath and the questions that you have about what's happening in my pelvic floor and my truck and my ribcage, again, depends on what the arms and the legs are doing - the extra load to the body. And now imagine that my demand for oxygen is going up because I'm moving a lot of my parts more. Let's say that I'm chopping wood. If any of you have ever chopped wood, you'll know, you've got a dominant side. There's a lot of twisting. Or if you've ever done a ton of twisting work where your heart rate is coming up because your demand for oxygen is great, but halfway through the bulk of those breaths, it's such a core intense exercise, that there's no phase for a relaxed breath, because you're using your abdomen quite intensely to stabilize your spine and a haul a heavy load up and over your shoulder to bring an ax down. So in this case, because my abdomen is so intensely participating in the movement that's increasing my demand for oxygen, then the shape potential for my rib cage is going to be much different. My diaphragm has a lot more resistance in this case because the diaphragm can move down a lot more easily if all the other stuff gets out of the way. If your abdomen can move out of the way, then your diaphragm doesn't have to contract against the tension of the abdomen being held in place by the abdominal wall contracting. And believe me, this would be so much easier if I could just videotape my body showing you all these different things. "", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'So I try to start with you have this cavity. These cavities that have to change position but then you have to kind of learn what the parts are doing relative to the other parts. And then if I have my waist twisted, or even if you\'re in a spinal twist, just a seated exercise, and you go to try to breathe that same shallow, sitting at your desk breath, you\'re gonna find that your abdomen can\'t move. And so for many people when they start doing things like our adjusting their rib position. Bringing it into a neutral rib cage, dropping your ribs, or they\'re doing hanging, or they\'re doing twisting, they\'re like, ""I can\'t breathe."" \xa0And what\'s happening, I would say in most cases, is that you have one pathway for breath because you have only certain parts of your body that are mobile and able to move because you don\'t really challenge all of your breath shapes because we don\'t take lots of shapes with our intensity of movement or exercise. We tend to do the same shape. And so if your body is in the same shape of exercise all the time, then the breath to drive that exercise is also the same shape. So by cross-training your exercise, especially when they are very diverse. Like it\'s one thing to cross train: I\'m cycling. Now I\'m running. But your torso is in the same position for both of those exercises. So it\'s cross training on one level, but it\'s not cross training on another level. So it just depends on how many pieces you\'re observing when you label something. So that seated twist or these other instances where people can\'t breathe, if you\'re so dependent on your abdomen needing to relax in order to let your diaphragm down, because the muscles in between your ribs don\'t move ', ' as soon as you disable that abdominal relaxation, as soon as you hold the ribs down in place and your rectus ', "" tenses, now you're breath has nowhere to go. And so of course, just if I've never said it before, breathing is the one thing you want to make sure that you can always do. So then you lose that form so you can continue to have that breath. So that's why we have a lot of exercises in Diastasis Recti and some of our new programs where it's like we are going to work on the muscles between the ribs. Because if the shoulder girdle and those inner costal muscles, which are the muscles between the ribs, aren't mobile, then you're missing kind of like a third of all the ways that you can breathe. And so I think a lot of times for many people, especially again, that chair baggage, includes the way we're breathing. And also where we're tending to take most of our breathing exercise and breathing and understanding some breathing is also during seated exercises where the oxygen demand is still very low and we're trying to just arbitrarily increase breath rates to get the exercise to move those parts but they're not a reflexive response to an actual increase in demand. I can sit here and hyperventilate. I can (breath, breath, breath) I can make than an exercise in the same way that I can get myself running without environmental stimulus. I can just choose to do it with my mind. \xa0But that's different than if I were to just pick up a load or walk up a hill quickly, I would still get that same breath rate, but it would be different than me sitting still and doing it. So I'm not sure if that's answering anyone's question specifically. But if we were in a room together, I would need to lay that down before we had any more discussions about what's happening during a natural breath. We want all of these breath pathways open for you. But opening the breath ways isn't really the point. The point is to be drawing in the breath. The point is to be taking yourself through lots of different loads. On the low and on the high end while doing or creating lots of diverse shapes with your body so that you are not only getting all of the variety and geometry of your skeletal muscles but that you're getting the range and shape through your smooth muscle as well. Especially cardiac muscle of your heart and the smooth muscle of your lungs. Okay. I'm gonna stop it there, and we'll keep working on it together over time."", ""The thing is, if you think about breathing in the same way that you think about all other needs for more movement and more diverse movement it really rings true still for the heart and lungs as well. We tend to measure them, again, as percentages of heart rate, but what happens is that when you think that you need a certain VO2 max or when we take a behavior of a group of people and look only at their heart rate or their VO2 max, and then try to duplicate their heart rate or their VO2 max and instead of the behaviors that got them to those heartrates or VO2 max. And I'm thinking of the Hadza specifically which are the hunter-gathering tribes where a lot of this data about just really fit moving populations who have very few diseases. They've got great low-risk factors for many diseases. Certainly cardiovascular disease. Is that what I think we're missing and what I wrote in a paper that came out last year was that if we don't think of movement in terms of geometry, then it makes it very challenging to compare all movements. We've kind of muddled the water a little bit where we've broken assessing movement to sometimes geometry and sometimes measuring simple measures - which I understand why we use things like heart rate and VO2 max because they're easy data to collect. But because movement is a geometrical phenomenon when you don't normalize and compare all movements with the same - when you don't compare apples to apples across the board it makes it challenging. So if I were to make a recommendation for you and kind of at the end of that section do we need cardio. We don't really need cardio so much. We definitely need to be deploying our lungs fully. They don't need to be deployed fully all the time. That's why distribution matters. But if you never really get into that full ... think of your lungs as a tissue that needs to stretch. And there are stretch receptors in there, and there are stretch receptors that work harmoniously and communicate with your heart rate. Right? \xa0Because the amount of stretch in your lungs is gonna dictate how much work your heart has to do. Because if you have low volume of oxygen, then you have to circulate it faster. So there's definitely the relationship between those two pieces. So just, I mean, move more, move more of you. Move in more challenging ways. We can get an increase in our cardiovascular performance having our heart, our stroke volumes change, which is maybe a technical term. Just think of the shape of the heart. It doesn't need to push the same all of time. There should be some fluctuation throughout the day. Same thing goes for your lungs. But I think that our lack of arm use while we're breathing has really informed the breathing model that we have going on right now. So if you are following the advent, you're gonna notice that we're going a little heavier this year. We're going heavier with our arms. Because the range of motion of your shoulders, what you're doing with your arms when you are doing something hard is where you're gonna start to see more variety in breath shapes. And to that listener question earlier on, what your pelvic floor and your abdomen and your diaphragm, and the muscles between your ribs and your shoulders are doing is depending on which activity you're partaking in when you are increasing that demand for oxygen."", '(heavy breath) need some water!', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'PACK: Thank you, Katy.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: I was trying to think back, and I believe we first connected online. And I was thinking it's either Twitter or maybe you emailed me about this piece of dynamic furniture that you had created called the Soul Seat years ago. And I've been sharing links to your chair and chairs I mean gosh for years now. \xa0If you've been following "", "" for the last ten years, which I can't even believe it's been that long, but you have seen the Soul Seat being discussed and just as you are coming up with new products I share it. Because anything that helps people get more movement is something that people need to be aware of. But can you describe the Soul Seat for those listening?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: Sure. Well, first I just want to say how grateful we are to your network and that you got it so early on. It was Twitter that I found you - came across your work. The Soul Seat, \xa0the best description is that it's a bilevel chair that gives you an option of sitting in many different postures while focused at a workstation or desk or a dining table. And it works because it's like taking a bolster on a floor but bringing it up to a desktop height with adjustments of both the floor and the bolster."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: It's interesting because as this whole discussion of - you know, I would say sitting is the new smoking. Because most people can remember when those headlines came out years ago and all the discussion that was around it. And it would be nice if everyone could just drop kick their chairs. Schools out for the summer! \xa0And just throw them out the window. But the reality is that we have completely structured our society's infrastructure around a chair. So that radical shift I don't think is possible. Just looking at the way societies change over time - and they do - when we make large changes in the way that we behave - and I believe we are in the middle of one regarding movement..."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: You've got a, I don't know the word, a segway of technology. Imagine if schools or if offices were to give up the chair. It would require a new desk... it would require so much new - all brand new stuff. New building design. So it's just nice when you have someone that's thinking about a transitional step that makes more movement accessible to people who are really participating regularly in these - I'm gonna call them stiff parts of the infrastructure. For me, I work full time, and I produce work in the modern world. But the way that I do it, I have a lot of latitude in the way that I can set up my office. I work full time from a home office. \xa0So if I want to come work in my pajamas and sit on the floor, that's something that I can do. But recognizing that is not something that many people can do. You have bridged this sedentary gap. So what was happening in our life, in your body, that led you to develop the Soul Seat?"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: Ah.

They may be making things, but they're spending more time at a computer. And so much of work that say a photographer who used to stand up and move around as they processed their negatives and developed their photographs. Now they're all sitting in front of computers.

I went cold turkey away from chairs once I figured out what was shortening my psoas. And then I realized I couldn't put everything on the floor. So some things really require a flat surface on a desk. So that's when I made the first Soul Seat out of a discarded task chair that I found on the side of the road in the rain. And I took the old seat panel off. And I cut a piece of wood. Bolted that on. Piece of carpet on it. And then I bolted a yoga block, the basic yoga block, I just bolted it onto a piece of pipe and screwed that onto the platform.

And then when I saw that in the market I got really annoyed. \xa0Right? Because I had already invented that. And then Zoe, when she was in college, she called me from San Francisco and said, ""Dad, they created your invention."" And I\'d written out an idea several years before about a zip car.

I\'m thinking Chitty Chitty Bang Bang right now is what\'s coming to mind. And the kids are thinking that\'s who you are and that\'s awesome. \xa0Ok, so you are that inventor personality.

It's so easy to criticize. \xa0It's much more challenging to solve. And so when someone has basically given up many comforts of their life to solve, I just want to make sure that I'm supporting solvers as much as possible. And so if I'm gonna shoot something, instead of just talking about it, it's just so much nicer to show people that other people have made these solutions and brought them to market. I mean people are buying couches and chairs. It's not like they are extra purchases per se. It's not like buying things you don't need. If you are going to have a seat, why not pick a seat that is designed to facilitate more movement. Not only to allow it but to kind of facilitate it."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: Yeah.

That's the one thing. I feel like I have a certain amount of time in my life. And I've parsed out quite a bit of it to this larger mission of understanding movement scientifically. Which is what I would consider my work. Because if everyone has work, that would be my work. The layperson, because the scientific community isn't necessarily doing anything practically with it. It's so it's this other part of just informing and sharing and cultivating a community and making sure that the practical understandings - that it's usable and practical. But if I not only do the work of doing that but then sit and monitor and be in relationship, it would mean that I would not be able to do my other work which I believe is part of my work as a human which is to be the thing. And so I have really let go of monitoring the stuff that I do in the world because if I was to make that my work too then I myself would not be a moving cell in this fabric. So I see really my first work is to do the thing. The second one is to understand and explain the thing, and the third one is help distribute the thing to the other cell, which are other humans in this fabric of the larger ecosystem.

Like that\'s the only way I can stay - keep going. But I have for example when your daughter, I think it was Zoe right, who brought it to the set, everyone on the set was on it like a jungle gym. Meaning, the idea of sitting differently was the equivalent of play. So I got to see 30 different people - so not just like the bodies that were in some of the work but the videographers and the producers, people who are just still sitting in chairs. So in that moment, you can see 30 different people trip out. Like ""What is happening right now?"" \xa0And it\'s such a simple thing. ""You are making a new shape with your body."" It\'s not that revolutionary. But to have a chair that did it was. So the feedback then was that it\'s amazing.', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: Great story to tell speaking of creatives and photographers. Our other daughter, Hannah, is now our director of operations. And she's been doing a lot of our social media work and actually produced our latest website. And so many of the photographs were done by a woman named Kim Wade. And we approached her initially - we walked in with a Soul Seat and said we need some new product shots of this. So we were talking about it, and she was pitching us her different packages. She wasn't ... we didn't consider her a customer. She didn't consider herself a customer. \xa0Then she sat on it, and the lights went on. So I suggested we just move it over to her workstation and she already has a stand-up desk, so we moved it over there, and it hasn't left. And you can see her appreciation of the Soul Seat in all the photographs... how beautifully they're done and so we ended up trading out that photo work for the Soul Seat she has. She said it just changed her life."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: There's two things I want to talk about. The funny thing is one: is I was actually going to talk about your new website. Obviously, I'm on your mailing list, and I noticed that really just in the last 30 days maybe 60 days that the images that you are using, your marketing images, for Soul Seat, are unlike anything I've seen before. Your imagery is now really showing the way the Soul Seat is utilized. And you've selected a bunch of different bodies. You've selected a bunch of different scenarios which is genius. And so now I'm thinking, well I wonder if the person embodying the Soul Seat was then able to see all the ways that it could be photographed. \xa0So then there's something else that's popping up in my head. There's a big understanding that creativity and movement go hand in hand."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'PACK: Mm.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: So I'm wondering now, because these photos are so great, do you think that she got moving and then the creativity welled up? \xa0When I talk about movement in teaching, I'll talk about every muscle as being essentially like that - a light. So when you're moving lights are coming on and off. So you're lifting and lowering your arms, and that lights up certain muscles and disables others. And then when you move in the other direction that lights up the other ones. "", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'PACK: Right.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: So when you said ""the lights went on"" when she ... she didn\'t sit; she moved differently. So that\'s the tough thing to understand that sitting, there\'s the idea of not changing place as a whole body, but then there is the idea of changing place of the parts of your body while your whole body still stays doing this what you call knowledge work. Did you create a list of images? Was there an impetus behind ""we want to cast the Soul Seat in a new light. We want to model all the different people and the ways it can be used."" Or was that her creativity?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: Well, there's two things. She actually suggested that we do a whole lifestyle shoot."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'KATY: Yes.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""PACK: It was her suggestion. We pulled the models together. The woman with the little baby, Daisy, is a yoga teacher, local yoga teacher. And the Korean/American woman is a local occupational therapist who has - I've consulted with her about the soul seat and the biomechanics involved. So it was just really, it was a great ... we just had a lot of fun. And she had a lot of fun because she appreciated the soul seat and knew what it could do. But the light went on for her when she first sat on it. We see it all the time when people first encounter. They project discomfort. They project some anxiety about falling off because it doesn't have a back and arms. But then once they sit, this light comes. It's basically recognition. They haven't felt this way sitting since they were on the kindergarten reading rug. And so that's part of what's going on - just the body discovers it can be that way again. It can feel that way again."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: You were an elementary school teacher, which we didn't get into too much.

And I gotta tell you, Katy, it just warmed my heart to see, she kept telling me about this one kid who had a lot of focus issues at the beginning of the year. And she said, do you want us to share? \xa0She had some videos of him not being able to focus and be frustrated because he wants to participate. He's a really smart kid. And so to see this, you wouldn't know that he had any focus issues. The Soul Seat was his chair. He used it for writing, sat in it for reading, and for the group, a lot of group ... We got to see a lot of the way the classroom is organized for the group activities. And the kids were cooperating and do doing their own facilitating of the morning routines. And it was just really exciting. And the other thing you'll like is that only 1/3 of this classroom was devoted to tables. All the rest was carpet. And the smartboard was on the wall low enough so that the kids were all sitting on the floor in front of their smart board doing these different activities. \xa0It's really something."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""KATY: Well that's great.

Right? The idea of mobility rich spaces is just a new concept. Like I said, we are in a time where - that society - there's this wave of understanding mobility is a thing.

So one of the things that I had to offer right away was the idea of a walkability rating. So a walkability rating - we've talked about it in a previous podcast. I think it's "", "" You can usually find a walkability rating if you're buying homes. Many realtors will have walkability ratings. You can find "", "". I can't remember what it is but if you follow us on Instagram, there was a post that went up I think September 6, a "", '. And there was a discussion on walkability. Because, like you said, walkability can mean the classic sense in a city that you can walk to do your errands, but what we were discussing is, is walking just the steps that you\'re taking that you can get something done while you\'re doing it or is there a natural element where, because if walking through nature over the very terrain is also part of this nutrient walking, if you can\'t get all of it, how do you pick which you\'re getting? Which I think is really what your question is. If we broke it down you\'re asking how do I have walkability. Which I think is mostly gonna be a term that relates back to how well can you get your chores done. And then there\'s nature time. And of course, I find walking through nature time to be separate than just walkability and just nature time. So I think in the end the way that you\'re gonna make that decision - again that decision, I don\'t know that there\'s a right answer. I don\'t know if there\'s a tool that will help you pick. It\'s probably going to boil down to frequency. For us, we live in a highly walkable area. But the areas that I can walk on the most to do my chores, you know, to get to schools and it\'s not just our school but to get to friend\'s schools, is mostly going to be pavement. We have lots of - we live in a lovely rural area but I don\'t think it\'s rural in the way that most people think about it where there\'s no sidewalks, that you have to drive for 20 minutes to get to a store. So I find this to be kind of close to a city. I can be in our city center on a paved road in a handful of minutes. If I\'m on a bike I can be downtown in 15 minutes. By walk, maybe 30. But when we do our nature time, we are going to be in a car often to get to it. So the way that I\'ve set it up is, for me, it\'s more important for me, since I\'m in what I would call regular daily life like most of you are where I\'m on my computer, I\'m grocery shopping, I\'m post officing shipping, I need to get to my office, my studio. Because I do that more regularly, being able to do that on foot means that we\'re gonna see lots of on foot movement through the 9 to 5. Those classic bits of the day. But we\'re close enough to nature time, I could go on a four or six-hour hike but the chances of me doing that, kind of again, that Monday through Friday work time are very slow. So I\'ve opted for lots of in city walking with nature time weekends, days off, vacations and when we can arrange it even weekday or camping is still 20-45 minutes, sometimes some of the backpacking that we do is a couple hours away. But it\'s still there. But if you had the ability to just be out in nature for the bulk of the day then you could go to that bigger space. But then again, people who live in those rural settings will send in emails saying ""I live in a completely rural area. I can\'t walk to do chores."" And I feel like chores are gonna be the more abundant element of most people\'s lives. If you have that small bit of nature outside your yard, I think that you can set it up to get that dose of what feels like more outdoor living just by making a small fire pit that you can sit and cook outside. I have found cooking outside during the 9 to 5 regular work day, non-vacation, non-summer, non-holiday, that element of our personal landscape, which is just in our backyard, which is just bricks in a square. We\'ve put a grill on top of it. That is what makes me feel like I have a very nature rich life. Like I can get out, I can cook outside, chop outside. And that doesn\'t require a forest nearby. Again, that can be done still, I think, within that city center. So I don\'t know how to steer you one way or another. I think that\'s a personal decision. But that\'s how I think about it. I think about what am I doing most of the hours on a regular day. How can I make that more movement rich? And bonus if those epic hikes, the days out in nature are still only an hour away. I think that that would be great for me. So hopefully that answers your question. That was the first time I\'ve gotten a ""where to move"" question versus a ""how to move"" question. But, I get it, they\'re all related. And if there are any of you out there who have a movement related question on your mind you can send it to me at ', ' and then stay tuned. Maybe I will answer your question in an upcoming episode.', ""So this podcast it's still brought to you by the "", "", I'm happy to say.

But we're gonna talk about sleep today because you wrote a book on sleep. So what I'm most curious about is why out of all this stuff you know did you choose to write a "", '?', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Yeah', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: True.', ""KATY: Well I have a little bookshelf in my house and a lot of people are always flowing through. And a lot of my health books disappear. I call it a loose lending library. But your book is consistently missing. My mom has hijacked it and friends have hijacked it. And it's really, it's an easy read. And I love books. As you know I like to read them, I like to write them. But I was in a bookstore over the weekend in Orange County in the Barnes and Noble in the Health section. And your book was there. And it was the only book on sleep. And it's so interesting if you think of a bookstore as kind of showing what's important to a culture..."", 'KATY: The health section is very small. And then of the health section itself, it\'s mostly diet and exercise. Diet is the biggest one. Exercise or movement is teeny tiny. And then there was one book on sleep. And when I originally was thinking about this series that I was going to do I was like, ""I want to focus on the everybody poops type perspective."" What are the things that all humans do?', ""KATY: Because there are some defining things. And sleep is one of them. So we're starting with sleep. And of course, not everyone sleeps the same amount. But everyone needs to sleep. It's part of our kind of the human condition. And you were talking about perspective of weight loss which is a lot of people would not tie..."", 'KATY: ...their sleep to their diet. But earlier this summer I was reading a book by Dr. Hanscom called ""Back in Control"". And he\'s a spinal surgeon. The subtitle of the book is ""A surgeon\'s roadmap out of chronic pain."" And I was trying to find the exact quote but it, too, is in my lending library and probably next to your book on one of my friend\'s shelves. There was a quote that said, ""I would not recommend that anyone get spinal surgery for pain until they\'ve dealt with sleep."" And I was just like ... that\'s huge.', ""KATY: It's huge to say that the musculoskeletal disorder that you are perceiving could, in fact, be heightened or even created by how you feel when you've had years or decades worth of poor rest and replenishment. And you have kids, young kids, and I have young kids. And it's so easy to recognize in them meltdowns, the way they perceive what's going on when they're not rested. And it's so hard to see in ourselves. Why do you think that is?"", 'KATY: Yeah. You have to monetize sleep. You have to pay per hour of sleep that you get then it would get more value.', 'KATY: (laughs)', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Right.', 'KATY: Okay.', 'KATY: Mmm.', ""KATY: I missed the window. I missed my 8-10 window. So that's it."", 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: We sleep without any window coverings because I rise with the sun just naturally. But I have posted pictures of it on Instagram and people have said, well where I live there's so much night lighting around that at nighttime when they have the windows uncovered it's like full blazing light. So a lightbox - I wonder if you could timer a lightbox. You know what I mean? To like kind of start coming on in the morning. So everyone will have to be creative about their own situations. Ok, that was one right?"", ""KATY: Ok, what's two?"", 'KATY: Okay.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Do it.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Right.', 'KATY: Nice compromise.', ""KATY: That's so interesting because I think that when people are trying to solve problems, pain problems, health problems, sleep problems, that the underlying assumption is that there's a problem with you rather than...these are all environmental things. Right? Like everything you just suggested is about not the person but just altering the environment so that you can have the natural response of just sleeping better."", 'KATY: It\'s just different. Like we get a lot of ""what\'s wrong with me? I\'m not working. I need to fix it."" And when you take medication and a lot of time for sleep, you haven\'t changed anything about the environment but you\'re trying to change something about yourself and sometimes it\'s just blocking out the windows and then throwing them open with the rising sun and maybe popping outside for a little bit. Okay. That\'s amazing.', ""KATY: So people have asked a lot about, so they're different than the people coming to you for I can't sleep. These aren't necessarily about not sleeping full stop, but they're about noticing the way that they feel in their body after they sleep. For example, waking up with a stiff back or a stiff neck. So one of the things that I have talked about a lot and have written about is, really maybe checking your pillow height. Because remember it's single repetitive positioning all night long. And so we all culturally just have something propping our head forward to the rest of our body and that I recommend that over time you just take a pillow and then the easiest way is to remove stuffing out of it or you just swap it with things smaller and smaller over time. Maybe ramp up a couple of shoulder and neck stretches. And then over time, you'll notice that you wake up more mobile because you're not fixing your body in one... basically it's like a forward head position a lot of times. And that's what people notice. So that's one of my recommendations for people who wake up with stiff necks, is to do it. Again, over time. For me, it was 18 months. So that's what I mean by over time. Not like over a week. Not over a month. But over a year and a half. The other thing is, you know you were talking about monetizing sleep, there's actually a huge industry around sleep. And that's with mattresses. What kind of mattress is it, right?"", 'KATY: Is it a soft mattress? Or a firm mattress. You can see the range of experts recommend opposing things all across the board. But in the end, when I teach movement I teach natural movement. One of the movements that I think we\'re missing naturally are pressure related movements. So that\'s, you know if you do, you go up onto a bar with your arm, you climb a tree with your arm. That bar kind of smooshes your arm - those are pressure deformation motions. So when you lie on the floor every night, or if you lie on the floor right now, you\'ll find that it\'s usually uncomfortable when you get started. But if you\'ve ever taken a yoga class or a stretching class by the time you get to that Savasana stable position it\'s much more comfortable because you\'ve kind of mobilized all of your parts. And so I do recommend for those people who are stiff when they get out of bed is one you can shift to a more supportive bed or eventually transition to something like a futon or we sleep on the ground here. Which is kind of similar to camping. If you lie on the floor though, if you don\'t want to give up your mattress, but you take 15 minutes to kind of prep your body for rolling out - it might be easier to fall asleep that way if you kind of basically done a little self-massage. Right? There\'s a difference between a massage therapist and lying on the floor, but ultimately it\'s still pressure application. So if you just got out and stretched on the floor, put your arms over your head, roll on one side, and the other side. It\'s almost like you\'re tenderizing your body for sleep. So that you don\'t have to get into bed for the first 30 minutes and then you can\'t really do that in a soft mushy bed. And then you start fretting that you\'re not gonna fall asleep and then you start getting into the mental space of ""why can\'t I sleep?"" which, for me, keeps me awake. And then, finally, I have a timer on my wifi. Just a Radio Shack, $8.99 timer, which clicks it off. And I do that not for the electromagnetic environment. It\'s actually to boot us off our computers if we\'re still on too late. It kind of like removes the option...', 'KATY: It\'s like a nice external personal trainer. It\'s like Shawn in your house going, ""Shouldn\'t you be in bed by now? It\'s too late."" And we set it earlier in the winter. And we\'ve decided ahead of time. We\'d like it to be off by 8:30 or 9. And then we just find that we\'re so lazy that we don\'t need to override it and turn it back on. Just that little reminder of we choose to turn it off by nine, boots us off and gets us into bed earlier. So those are some of my strategies.', 'KATY: Sure.', 'KATY: Correct.', 'KATY: Why not?', 'KATY: (laughs)', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""KATY: It is. Like all the fascia work and the ball rolling, getting on the floor is like the lowest level of that. Because there's not a lot of - there's nothing being pushed into your body crevices. So if you lie on the floor, and then roll over, lie on your stomach, get on your fetal position, roll over to the fetal position on the left, roll back and forth on your spine, up and back a few times, roll on your stomach so you're totally prone arms spread out like you're doing a reverse snow angel, lay on your back and do a snow angel that way. And consider that your kind of, like I said, just body tenderizing routine. See how that works with everybody's sleep.

I think one of them being depression. Where handwork seems to be something that many people, if not all of us, require. So I'll see if I can get her on the show sometime. Because I'm not a hand ... I haven't been a hand worker. But I've had a chance to come to your shop and work on my own pair of shoes through a very lovely opportunity.

And you\'re obviously setting up a workspace that allows them to tend to their own needs at the same time. But it\'s almost like, like there needs to be a continuum of slow fashion. What is slow fashion that is not only about buying clothes, clothing, that meets better the needs of the people making it? But clothing that meets your needs better for the person that is wearing them. I\'ve been searching for that term. And it\'s kind of like - it\'s what I consider dynamic clothes. Pairing the slow movement with clothes that don\'t disrupt your movement in the way that traditional shoes do.

But I want to hear, because these are questions that I don't think I've ever asked you necessarily as a friend."", 'JILL: Sure.', 'KATY: So this is new ground for me. \xa0How did you develop YogaTuneUp?', ""JILL: \xa0Ok. So Yoga Tune Up came out of, really it's my own personal development of self care and self care movement strategies. So my original movement training was a combination of yoga and bodywork. So I started studying massage. Started studying Shiatsu massage when I was in college around - I think I was either 17 or 18 when I went into that first open house at the Shiatsu school. But I started doing work study out of curiosity. I had no business studying massage outside of a full load of classes at Northwestern University. But I walked in there and was the demo gal in the - you know they do a free sample and I volunteered. \xa0And it definitely was one of those things that changed the course of my life. And I ended up, while I was studying at Northwestern, studying dance and movement and performance, performing arts, and yoga was always kind of the thing I did in the morning to make me feel good and to prepare me for whatever classes were up ahead. But I ended up going to spend my summers during college at a place called the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies which is a beautiful retreat center in upstate New York. And it's there where I met my mentor. His name is Glenn Black. He is a self described rogue yogi. He's kind of off the beaten track. Not somebody who was ever interested in fame and fortune as a teacher. But he was a movement genius and a bodywork genius in the sincere definition of genius. I still have not found somebody who eclipses him in terms of creativity, in being able to induce state change within a classroom which,by the way, is one of the unique features of, I think, all yoga practice should be that you can really host conscious awareness within parasympathetic states and do really cool things there. So he is just a master of that as well as hands-on modality or hands-on orthopedic medical massage under the tutelage of a physical therapist out of New York named Smuel Tatz who has a system called Body Tuning. So it was many consecutive summers, me going to Omega, and working in their sun tree store, living in a tent, and doing yoga classes with Glenn and also learning body tuning from him, which is the hands-on, the massage modality. And I ended up assisting him in a lot of his - in his work. Then I move. I leave all that behind. I'm done with college and I want to come to LA and be an actor because that was really what I felt was my virtue was the performing arts. And the healing arts were just the thing I did on the side. Well not on the side. They sustained me and now that I'm a 46 year old looking back on my own developmental history I understand that these were how I regulated myself. Because I have a history of being an anorexic as a tween and then bulimic in my later teen and early 20 years. So the healing arts really helped me heal. When I got to Los Angeles, I got into the yoga scene out here which was heavy in the ashtanga vein and you know, flow yoga. And I dove into this stuff. Eventually I was in another system of yoga that had a very specific type of power yoga and I started teaching at that studio and took their teacher training. But when I started teaching what I found was that the power yoga stuff that I was currently learning or doing, wasn't what was coming out. What started to come out was the eye that I had developed under the mentorship of Glenn. And this interest in joint mobility or joint movement. So it stopped people in the middle of a class and be really discouraged with how they were doing an asana and I would take them through these tune-ups that would help to improve their proprioception of their joints and get them to develop better motor control of that joint. And then we would dive back into the practice. And eventually I started using tools. There's a much longer story but eventually I started bringing therapy balls into the classroom because I wasn't a bodyworker even though I trained for years as a bodyworker, I never got licensed but I knew that people could do this themselves. They could use self touch to find these tissues that weren't cooperating with the performance of a movement task. They could excite their proprioceptors. And in the meantime, they'd feel great because they were also exciting certain parts of their autonomic nervous system. And so yoga tune-up really became this hybrid of biomechanically delivered movement information coupled with self massage to help people better map themselves and have a better sense of themselves to what I like to say embody your body. And then the tune-up portion is me paying homage to Glenn and Shmuel for teaching me body tuning and that's what it is. "", ""KATY: So what's that time span that you just did? 20 years?

And we're gonna talk about hips. I wanted to bring you on specifically to talk about hips because you just had a hip replacement. Is that right?"", ""JILL: I had the total hip replacement on November 1 of 2017 so today we're taping at the end of September so I'm almost at 11 months."", ""KATY: Yeah, so it's been about a year. Right. So what is just ... \xa0I guess if we talk about your career in movement and we talk about that timeline this is another phase of your movement journey."", 'JILL: Yeah. Definitely.', ""KATY: Right? So it's pretty new in your way of ... I saw you on "", ' and your writing curriculum which you\'ve been doing for a long time and how you look back and reflect on previous curriculums and what you want to add in now that you\'ve had a new movement experience. So as a system builder and someone who writes curriculum and books about movement, I too am often, as I have new experiences, you\'re like, ""Oh I want to go back to some of that old stuff and change some words and add moves and different things."" \xa0So you\'ve had a hip replacement. You\'ve had hips of many different types for a long time, so I wanted us to talk about action items for keeping our hips well and so I want you to give me, you can do three, I\'ll do three. We can go back and forth. And this could be something that you\'ve been teaching over the last 20 something years or something that you\'ve now recently added. And if you want to explain a little bit. ', ""JILL: \xa0Yeah. Well I'm really encouraged by the process that I went through with hip replacement in terms of preparedness and rehab-ness. What I teach is prehab. What I teach is rehab. \xa0Rehab and prehab are my life. That is what "", ' and ', "" do. They help you to prepare tissues for movement and they help you to get to know your tissues and to better embody your body. \xa0So the stuff that I'm gonna describe to you are things that I think uniquely kept me out of owie type of pain leading up the surgery. The first tip that I have involves therapy balls. Because I feel that the therapy balls and how we use them give you a sense of the textures of your own tension. I have two different ball techniques that I think is helpful either pre or post. And one is "", ' to all humans which is to use the ', "" in your trunk to improve your sensing of how you breathe. \xa0And the textures of tension in the myofascial interfaces of your respiratory diaphragm and the other respiratory muscles that really are the lining of your birthday suit. \xa0So I instruct people, if they don't have a "", "" which is a grippy air-filled ball to use some time of a firm-ish pillow but not a hard thing. You don't want to use a soccer ball. You don't want to use a basketball. You want something that has yield. \xa0So kids' balls - if you have a girdyball laying around the house, or great nerf balls are great. You want something that has a little bit of girth and that you can deform with your own breathing. So when you lay down on the "", "" whether it's on your abdomen or your sternum or the side of your waist or the side of your rib cage, you'll immediately start to inhibit, because that's what the ball's pressure does it inhibits, the area that is under touch or under load or under shift from the device. And you can do a "", "" to try to overcome the natural muscle bracing or the natural resistance to the tool. And you do that by breathing, holding your breath temporarily, and contracting the muscles that are interfacing with the ball. \xa0And then when you exhale what you'll find is that your nervous system will have temporarily unkinked or unlocked some of that unconscious muscle bracing. And you do that progressively. You breathe in, you hold your breath and contract. Then exhale. And there can be more artful ways of doing that but that's sort of the basic thing. And what we do with that is depending on whether you start on your side or you start on your front, you'd roam the ball, the "", "", into different areas of your trunk to try to mobilize the unknown tensions, unknown inappropriate tensions between diaphragm and ribs and diaphragm and transversus abdominis. \xa0So that would be the first thing so that you can get a sense of your full cycle of respiration. So respiration should occur all over your trunk. And although it only occurs in your lungs, but the soft tissues that are responsible for taking a range of motion breath should result in movements both below the diaphragm and above the diaphragm if they're occurring well well above the diaphragm in the neck or collarbone area, which is our default. That our sort of emergency default respiratory area, then there's other things to be done. But really what we're looking for here is what we call an abdominal thoracic breath."", 'KATY: Because of the relaxed position.', ""JILL: Because of the relaxed position - no because neurologically we don't want to be in a heightened sympathetic state but we want to be in an alert relaxed state which an abdominal thoracic breath will allow us to have that. And also a thoracic breath that's done in the context of a relaxed environment can help to keep the thoracic spine mobile as well. \xa0When your ribs don't move, upward rotation and inward rotation of the ribs - if they're not moving well, chances are that your thoracic spine is probably not moving as well as it can either. So the thoracic breath gives us, is an indicator of unknown tensions in that area of the body. "", "" is not going to come into play when you've got your rucksack and your trucking up a 15-degree incline. You're not going to be pulling out the Coregous ball and breathing into it. You're gonna have your backpack that you're gonna be using in that case but what's interesting about the diaphragm and its shape and you know it's like a caster inside of your trunk. So you can breathe - you should be able to breathe in any type of position. I work with singers. And opera singers, they get in very contorted positions and they have to produce a tremendous amount of clear, resonant sound while they're in - affecting different emotional states. Like there's so many different ways that the diaphragm uniquely serves our structure. And this is like, what I'm doing is I'm putting it in a Petrie dish..."", 'KATY: Right.', ""JILL: I need to start here. And what I didn't say is what this about preserving my hips? \xa0If I can get my tissue to become compliant while applying the "", "", it's going to relax me. \xa0The Coregous ball in and of itself, it's gonna massage viscera, it's going to apply pressure that will stimulate the vegas nerve both in my abdomen and in my rib cage area. Different arcuate sprigs of that nerve. So that will help to calm me down. So that's helpful especially if I'm experiencing a lot of pain. On a myofascial interconnection level, the respiratory diaphragm has two soft tissue crossovers with a couple of very powerful spine muscles. One is the quadratus lumborum. And the other is the psoas. \xa0Now the quadrium lumborum has a lot to do with the relationship between the rib cage and the pelvis. As do the obliques which are on top which you are rolling all over anyway. And then the psoas is latching all the way down to the femur. So you have the psoas which I'm sure you talk about on this podcast before, but the psoas is stitched - it's pasted on to the anterior longitudinal lumbar spine and its discs. And the diaphragm has to cross over it in order to get to the spine. So when we're massaging into our abdomen as you are with the "", "", or even into the rib cage you're going to affecting tensional pulls both into the quadratus lumborum and the psoas - which can help relieve some of the stress and strain that those muscles may be carrying because of your gait from a degenerating hip or knee if we go even more south."", 'KATY: \xa0All replacements. \xa0Right exactly. All parts. All parts.', ""JILL: Yeah. \xa0All parts all the time. So that would be a way of both directly and indirectly mobilizing in a very soft state of being - that area. Right? So we're getting motion and lotion into the interfaces between the diaphragm and the psoas and the diaphragm and the quadratus lumborum, both of which are helping us to navigate our footfall and our pelvic list as we walking."", ""KATY: So if we're talking hips I guess the big thing to remember is, it's not all going to be in the hips that you want to move for healthy hips. It really ends up becoming a whole body situation. "", ""JILL: It's definitely a global situation."", 'JILL: Yes. Yeah.', ""KATY: From that, though, there's two things within that: that one requires that you're able to identify a vertical leg which is one that doesn't have a slight knee bend or if you hyperextend one that doesn't have that hyperextension. So some people need to straighten and some people need to bend. But to be able to find a straight leg and to be able to have that leg be vertical. Which means the pelvis is going to line up directly over the knee, over the ankle joint as you look at the body from the side. From there it would be the kneecap release. Can you relax the quadriceps so that the patella is not pulled up, which pushes back into the knee joint below and from there can you list the pelvis."", 'JILL: Love it.', 'KATY: But those two things, if you jump right to kneecap release or pelvic list, the intention of those are really so that you are able to stand on a single leg. And for many people use your the posterior and the lateral part of your hips more verses always being on the front.', 'JILL: Yes.', ""KATY: \xa0And so that's just it. That's just it. And to me, that is something that can be put into your standing work desk time, your standing in the bank line. There's also, to add more tips to this, it also requires that you have no heel on your shoe because you can't distribute that weight back. So it's basically all my books in a single move which is can you stand on a single leg, giving more work to the 360 degrees of the hips or is your way of standing on a single leg giving it completely to the knee or to the front of the hip."", 'JILL: The joint.', 'JILL: \xa0Oh my gosh. I love it so much because it actually echoes my second tip.', 'KATY: Ok.', 'JILL: \xa0You put your hands up against a wall and your hands are a little bit wider than shoulder distance apart and this is so that you can recruit the serratus and also the erector chain. \xa0Lots of things. All muscles are involved here. This is a whole body isometric. You have your feet underneath your hips and you come into a partial relevé.', ""KATY: What's a relevé?"", 'JILL: Oh yeah. You lift your heels off the ground.', ""KATY: \xa0Ok. It's a dance term."", ""JILL: A relevé is a dance term of coming up to en pointe. So it's just about a one and half inch lift. So not much but it's going to challenge lots of your proprioception when you do that. \xa0And so you push into the wall, try to lift the wall up. And try to get your legs straight. What you were saying: Standing on one leg. So you've got your hands up against the wall and then you dorsiflex or not pointe but the opposite of pointe, the left foot without shifting at all. So you have loaded your body weight through that right foot, its locked into the ground. And then you attempt to extend the left hip, meaning you bring your heel behind you but it's not generated from the foot. It's generated from the deep, what I would call the deep gunnies, like the deepest aspect of your tush. So you're extending that hip. It's not going to go very far. Without letting your pelvis lift or change. So it's an isometric. I mean, you move it to the degree that you can and then lock it in place. \xa0And it gives you this moment in time for that transition within gait. And then you switch sides. This is hard to describe on a podcast. It really is something that has taken me about a month to learn just from my therapist alone. But I've been sharing it with my students and people are just pouring sweat with this isometric. It's amazing."", 'KATY: I think that most people don\'t have their legs fully extended - and that\'s not even hyperextended. There\'s been sort of a slight bend to the knee put into almost 100% of fitness and movement recommendations including any time I do anything for a magazine, they will always edit in when I add, ""Find this vertical straight leg"" they will always edit in but keep a slight bend to the knee. \xa0Like to the point that it doesn\'t even make sense.', 'JILL: Yeah.', ""KATY: It's like this basic protect, keep everything soft and slightly bent. And as we really improve or expand the movement narrative to beyond being at rest in the playing field or as we know so much more about it we've got this kind of old anchor to this old general guideline that is just too your point, now being something that requires an exercise and therapy to get out of because if not, you're never really loading your glutes and that hip extension and ultimately even your lower calf, right?"", 'JILL: Absolutely.', ""KATY: As it's belaying the rest of your body as it moves forward. You bend that knee and you just - it's like walking without using very much tissue. It's walking without very much movement of many parts is what that does. \xa0Which does not mean we all stand and walk and hyperextend our knees all the time. There's something between those two continuums. And that's what I'd like people to be able to find."", 'JILL: Yeah.', ""KATY: Not the walking exercises that are elements or these snapshots of elements to a stride or a gait cycle. That you are actually logging in more steps that is passing you through moving all these parts that all these exercises have just moved while you're not walking."", 'JILL: Yeah.', 'KATY: \xa0But, that walking more is not only more steps, it\'s going to be using more of your body while you\'re walking. Which is why the correctives and the footwear changes are so important. Because if you have already walked yourself in a way that led to the knee for joint replacement, continuing to walk in that same way is not necessarily the best strategy. Which is why I appreciate the front load of more ""learn how you\'re moving"" to kind of play with the nuances before you hit volume. \xa0Also, sometimes a way to move more of you is to move over varied terrain and to move at different speeds. Those are more natural ways of getting slightly different shapes in your torso and in all of the muscles of your legs and your feet. Every one of those things, the terrain and the rate that you\'re walking actually creates a different - I use the term shape. Another way of explaining it is, if you imagine every one of your muscles, the discreet muscles being a light bulb that\'s on a dimmer, movement is really, for every movement, there are lights that are brightening and dimming. So that\'s what happening when we move. \xa0And so even though you have a particular gait when you, and we would see the same lights come on and come off with every step, when you stepped onto unique terrain, even if it\'s something as simple as I played with textured foot pads inside of a shoe, it\'s super teeny tiny little ridges, things that you could barely even see - little lines and bumps. You will get a different light configuration in your calves just by putting some slightly different textured insert within your shoe. So it doesn\'t even have to be hills or lumps and bumps or walking over roots of a tree. Your body is just constantly changing its light configurations going slowly. Going at a greater speed over the same terrain while giving you different light shade. So that\'s what I mean by shape is that your movement diversity is not only sometimes walking differently on the same terrain as you always take. Sometimes it\'s as simple as taking different terrain. \xa0', "" JILL: \xa0All right, so tip 3 is to learn how to create the diaphragm vacuum. And on the flip side of that to also learn how to create what I call the tensional diaphragm. So in trying to understand this oblique relationship to your ilia, the rib to pelvis relationship, I like to go to deep levels of mobilizing the respiratory diaphragm both in its elongation phase and also in its most hemispheric curvy phase. So the diaphragm vacuum is a stretch of the respiratory diaphragm that happens after you exhale. \xa0And you stay in an apnea - so you're without air - and then you try to stretch your ribs apart as if you're taking a fake ribcage breath. When you take a fake ribcage breath when you don't have any air in your body, what happens is the diaphragm -because it attaches to the lower 6 ribs which is a lot of ribs in your body - when you move your ribs outward the diaphragm has to go along for the ride. And so it gets profoundly tractioned in its spherical-ness. And that is a wonderful thing for maintaining the motions between your diaphragm and all the tubes that penetrate it which includes your esophagus, your aorta, your vena cava, and the different nerves that tunnel through the diaphragm. \xa0But it also, when you do that diaphragm vacuum, can induce a relaxation response which is a great thing but also it can tug tug at that psoas diaphragm connection. It is a movement that really exemplifies whether you can click into a parasympathetic state as well. I have very few people that ultimately can't do this movement. And usually, it's people who have overtrained their transversus abdominus. Sometimes pilates professionals have a very difficult time letting go of the tension in their abdominal wall if they were to do this. Or if people who have profound high anxiety states or anxiety disregulation. So it's a really wonderful tool to use to not only calm down your nervous system but to move the lining of birthday suit without a ball. \xa0So this is something that I use every day to offload the pelvic floor temporarily. It will actually traction up your uterus and your bladder - give your organs a little hug. And it can be really helpful for identifying tensions in your spine as well. So it's one of my go tos of - well, how's this moving today? And give me an indicator of where I might want to go in my disciplined movement practice or it might inform me of how my day was prior."", ""KATY: Well, my tip would probably be - it's along those same lines. It's generally the idea that your torso is holding likely way more tension than you realize and that tension, because of the psoas major, because of the diaphragm, because of every breath, because of every step, is then creating loads on your hips and your knees and ultimately your ankles and your lumbar spine that are highly repetitive. \xa0And so we're trying to diversify your ability when you do move that you're able to move more of you. And Jill I think ultimately it's yours as well. That you're moving more parts. That you're getting more parts of you that are sticky or not participating, you're getting them moving."", 'JILL: Right.', ""KATY: So my tip is, it's somewhat similar. And we call it the diaphragm or the abdominal release. You get onto your hands and knees. You let your head hang. And you do the unthinkable. You let your belly all the way out and down. \xa0So this is a very non-technical, very accessible, very quick way to not only create loads. I think that you're also, when you do this, you quickly tune in to how much you actually hold in your stomach. Sometimes it's because you've been trained to keep your belly button towards the spine or you do exercises regularly that's about kind of drawing everything in and upward. Which then, when your diaphragm goes to move down is now met with all the stuff that was kind of on the outside of your body has had to move inward and then displaces everything that's in your abdominal contents upward or sometimes downward. Which then pushes, that's where diastasis recti - I'm talking about creating hiatal or inguinal hernias. We're moving internal stuff around by where we're pushing and pulling our body. And in this case the abdominal release is for you to turn all of that off. And when you turn all of it off, maybe you've been doing a ton of hip extension exercises and you're trying to figure out how to get your hip to extend more without realizing that how you hold your torso is part of that scenario. So you're constantly holding your tension in and also trying to stretch your leg in the opposite direction. So it's like you're fighting yourself all the time. So it's just - it's one of our releases. So you'll notice there's kneecap release and now there's abdominal release. And then the goal isn't to keep your abdomen soft and relaxed all of the time. Because once you start doing more complex movements, there is, again, there's going to be a whole volume of shapes that your abdomen is going to create based on what you're doing. So again, if you're carrying something heavy on your right side, that's going to be one abdominal shape. If you carry it on your left side, new abdominal shape. We don't want one stiff shape to follow us around all the time. Rather, you want this kind of different lights coming in and coming off in your trunk musculature all the time. But if you pre-tense with everything that you do, you don't really get that variety of shapes. So this is a way of learning how to turn off any purposefully or consciously or subconsciously held tension so that your abdomen can go about doing its job which is to respond reflexively to the environment that you put it in. Then of course, for your hips again, see all the other things above which is not just to get this nice soft supple core and then sit down in a chair with it all the time. Those two things don't work together. \xa0It's to get this super supple core and then move robustly with it so it can do its thing, which is to move all of your parts around; hips and knees and low back and neck and feet all included. Ok, so Jill and I are going to be taking ... this is the first time I've said this on this podcast. "", 'JILL: \xa0Oh yeah. Totally.', 'KATY: So we are going to be co-teaching a ', "" at 1440 Multiversity. February 1 through 3. Which it's in the Bay area California."", 'JILL: Beautiful.', ""KATY: I'm excited because usually when you teach something you're just like teach teach. But since we're co-teaching I can teach and then I can sit down and then move my own body not having to teach. Which I'm thrilled about."", ""JILL: I am so looking forward to it. We've got a really great outline that we're working out for all the people that are there. \xa0And the privilege of actually getting to move my body under your instruction after - before or after I share. It's going to be really cool."", ""KATY: I'm looking forward to it. I feel this is a hybrid of work/self-care for me. Which, again, is awesome for everyone. Even the teachers need an abundant amount of self-care and to learn. And to learn."", 'JILL: Sure. \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: And then you also have an event coming up this month (this will come out in October) so tell us about your hips immersion.', ""JILL: I'm teaching a 3-day hips immersion. It's a "", '. My company is Tune Up Fitness. \xa0You can find it online on ', "". And it's at the YogaWorks in Tarzana which is Los Angeles California. And it's three days where we work from pelvis to feet. Although, of course, in my book, you can't separate the pelvis from the abdomen so of course, we'll be using diaphragm technology some of which I've talked about on my tips today in order to open up this point of view of paradigm shifting self-care fitness for anybody in attendance. And it's for anybody. We will have a lot of teachers and movement educators and clinicians in there but it's also for people who just want to gain more knowledge."", 'KATY: Well you can find out more about Jill Miller at, as she just said, at ', '. You can find all of her therapy balls that she mentioned, including the ', 'which I love, video products and books, upcoming workshops, all available there on that site. \xa0And you can find both of these tips, hers and mine, organized on the podcast transcripts page. Jill thank you so much for coming on today.', ""JILL: It's an absolute pleasure, Katy. Thank you."", ""Today, we’re focusing on Venn Design. I love \xa0Venn Design. Venn Design are these really beautiful - they're stability balls. But it's not really that they're stability balls, it's really what's wrapped around them. It's dynamic furniture. It's the thought that's gone into taking something that so many of us have, cushions and balls around our home, and changing their aesthetic by making them look more like furniture so that we end up moving more just in the context of our own homes. So today I would like to welcome Tyler Benner to Move Your DNA. Tyler, welcome."", 'TYLER: \xa0Hi Katy! Thanks for having me on.', ""KATY: \xa0Ok, so I have many of your pieces of - I mean I don't even know if I'd call it furniture. -Spherical upholstered seats and cushions. I have them in my home. \xa0I love them. I love anything that allows me to add more movement to my space. And the more beautiful it is, I think, the better it is. Not necessarily for me but for people who want their spaces to be both attractive and movement friendly. So at which point did making these items become a priority for you?"", ""TYLER: \xa0Yeah. You know I originally had the idea back in 2012 and that just means that I drew some sketches on paper and was trying to think about covering a round object with fabric which I learned later on after many trial and errors that covering a curved surface everywhere was a challenging prospect to do. And then I just kind of dabbled with it and I wasn't skilled with a sewing machine and I didn't really know how to bring my ideas to life. \xa0So I started talking with furniture upholsterers and there are several years where it bounced around in my brain and my heart a little bit more than it was actually a tangible thing. And then 2015 was when the first Venn chairs were created and it went beyond just trying to cover a round object with fabric to where we really tried to turn it into a furniture item. And by furniture item I mean to make it belong next to your sofa, to have some padding to it so that the temperature of it is comfortable to sit on and have around you. It went through a whole design and kind of transformation in 2015."", 'KATY: I read on your website: \xa0""Originally inspired by stability balls, designer Tyler Benner set out to create a spherical upholstered seat. As his posture improved and his body began to change, his mind opened up a whole new movement-centered design aesthetic."" \xa0And so I love that you link the change in your body with the change in your mind. What did you make of that relationship.', ""TYLER: \xa0Well, for me it also coincides with how I've changed my running. \xa0And at a similar time to when I was creating Venn chairs, I was also trying to improve the shape and structure of my body. And that started some with correct toes which are some prosthesis that you put between your toes to help your toes spread out when you're running and moving. And then eventually through a man named Mark Cucuzaella and Lee Saxby, \xa0I learned to run in sandals, almost barefoot of sorts and they really started to open my brain up to different ways the human body can move. And I started to bridge all these ideas together in Venn chairs as well. And so I was improving my posture. I was improving how force moves through my body. And that was anything from standing, walking, sitting, and running. I started to see how they all met at some intersection point. And that to me was about dynamic stability."", ""KATY: Now you're an archer. I know that you're an archer. A good one who has written books about archery. \xa0And so I know my own way of seeing the world which is through force production, shapes, geometry, efficiency, movement. Like I would say that all of those things are always kind of - they're over my eyes as I've looked through the world. They're what jumps out to me in the same way maybe someone who is a particular type of artist or a photographer might see the way colors and light are in a particular set up. I'm interested in - it seems like you and I have similar ways. You like to create things. I know you've created shoes and systems. So you're more a builder of tools and I would say I don't have that tendency. But why do you think that you too are interested in force and alignment in physical performance? \xa0Is there something at the base of all those things?"", ""TYLER: That's a great question. One of the ways I would try to answer that question isn't deep and expansive, I would say. But a simple way I would try to answer it is, when you watch someone really skillful do what is very challenging motion, they somehow manage to do it with economy of motion and an efficiency that is perplexing to see how simple it can look. \xa0And then when you go to try to do that yourself, you feel very disconnected. And so archery is a good example of connecting to yourself and to this kind of known position of center inside of you. And when you release the bowstring, there's two forces through your legs that are connecting you to the ground and then the two forces through your arms - they all meet in the middle of you, in the center. And your job as an archer is to control this power and position of center so you have a stable base and platform. You can only do this at a skillful level when you practice this a lot. And growth from that first looking like a beginner when you feel disjointed and wobbly to eventually gaining confidence and strength and clarity in your mind, the people who are very skillful at sport, they have a better idea in their head of what to do. Their brain can only think to do a certain motion because that's part of their routine. That's part of their performance routine. And for archers, you might it call your shot routine. But if you're on the starting blocks of running a 100-meter race or you're about to serve in tennis, you all have a particular kind of game plan that you need to run through your brain. \xa0So if you're not thinking the right things, you're not going to be able to create that virtuoso performance."", 'KATY: \xa0Well you essentially started a dynamic furniture company. One of the first - kind of trendsetting. And you made it look fairly easy.', ""TYLER: (laughs) That's kind of you."", ""KATY: Well that's how it looks to me. I think that anyone who does anything well, it always just looks so easy and I don't think that anyone observing necessarily knows all the things that go on behind it, right? \xa0Everyone's an overnight success. Everyone does things with ease. But like you said, there is many trial and error, many hours of practice usually logged on the back end which are not cluttering the performance space. \xa0That is at least your website for your furniture. I feel like Venn Design was originally for yourself but I feel like you, too, because you are creating products and information it means that you are moved somehow to inform or move others. So who is Venn Design for? \xa0And why is that work important to you."", ""TYLER: Yeah, it's a great question. You're right that I set out to be my own first customer, I guess. I'm trying to make things that I want around me and that I use at home and they make me stronger and better. \xa0And as I've used that methodology in my life, I've found success. And then again I'll talk about archery a bit here because I competed for many years. It wasn't until I created this book and started sharing it with everyone that I also started to get this really positive feedback loop of trying to tell people about my experiences and then hear what they had to say about it or what they learned from it. And so, yeah, I just think there's this symbiotic growth between doing something and then sharing it with others and trying to teach it to them, and then learning from their experience too. It's only gonna increase your total depth. It's only gonna increase your total ability to try to tackle a problem or solution. And I get so much inspiration from people writing back to me and sending in pictures or videos of the fun ways that they use Venn Chair or how it's helped them with back problems, maybe, at work or that they have more creativity or more energy throughout the day. \xa0That gives me inspiration and creativity too. So I'm just trying to create as much as I can every day. I'm pushed to try and go share more because I just draw more inspiration from that."", ""KATY: What's the most creative thing anyone's ever done with their chair."", ""TYLER: \xa0Um, I have some hilarious comments. I can probably talk about animals and animals have fun with Venn Chair's too and maybe they're jumping on them or maybe they push them around with their heads or I love that Venn encourages play. \xa0So I get pictures of people doing backbends or bouncing. My little niece and nephews, they love watching a movie on one or just bounce around having fun. I think that's the best."", ""KATY: The thing I appreciate most about what you create is, I feel like I have a particular understanding of what we call minimal to kind of be more maximal. I have one of your spherical chairs but if it was just this big office chair it would just be where I would sit down and work and that's really all it would be. \xa0But I have this chair and like you said, I can also throw down a backbend, I can pick my feet up. I can kneel on it and really do balance stuff. But my kids will grab it and it becomes moved out into the living room or these other spaces and it becomes, I mean I could probably send you videos of maybe not how they're supposed to be ... I mean, maybe there is no way how they're supposed to be…"", ""TYLER: There is no way how they're not supposed to be used."", ""KATY: Right, that's great. \xa0Yeah. So they are definitely inspiring play in me during work time. But it also is one piece of furniture that takes up less space that allows more people to access and move themselves more and also to move more of their parts. So, again, is that minimalism or is that maximalism? You decide."", ""TYLER: That's a great question. Yeah. I want to add to that of, I was inspired by stability balls at first. Except that what would happen is that either myself or friends who were using stability balls as a chair when you'd have guests over you'd hide it in the closet. "", 'KATY: It has to be pretty.', ""TYLER: Exactly. \xa0Right? They just don't belong in your environment or something unless you're trying to exercise. And that was one of the things that I wanted to fix or solve. So I wanted to create a beautiful piece of functional furniture. I don't think when I was first creating them that I truly saw how much fun people were gonna have with them or that they would be as versatile as they are. \xa0Frankly, I'm still in the process of creating the total vision for a space of, what if your home is filled with furniture that is fun? That you enjoy. That makes you want to play. Is good for your body. I think we're just at the beginning of creating furniture and objects around us that actually make us better not just take up space."", 'KATY: Yeah. I agree. And I think that that is ... I wrote an article not too long ago called: ', "" And it was really just the idea that exercise equipment signals your brain to move but classic things in your house whether it be a seat or even a belt for your outfit, these things signal rest time or sitting time or getting dressed time. Even though you could use that belt as a yoga strap. So I think that what's important now is that we start to critically look at our environment. And that includes everything that you put yourself in, right? That's your clothing. The walls of your home. And start doing something very similar to what you did which is by making a small subtle change, a ball, instead of a chair, but you haven't just added another - kind of an ugly exercise plastic ball that stands out as it doesn't fit in your mind for the context of a living room - simply by making it beautiful and aesthetically pleasing and looking like it fits in an office and looking like it fits in a home, you end up circumventing the part of your brain that tells you it doesn't belong there. Or, in this case, that movement doesn't belong in your home. So I think that you've done this literally and figuratively in a beautiful way. \xa0And so I'm looking forward to what you're creating next. So that's my last question: What are you creating next?"", ""TYLER: Yeah. First of all, I want to say thank you for what you just said there because it was really beautiful as I heard you say it and it was like: Yeah, that is my vision in what I'm trying to create. Exactly what you described there. What I'm creating next - it's at an intersection of a lot of these ideas and I'm making some floor pads so that it makes it a little bit easier to kneel in addition to our sitting cushions or depending upon the surface that you have at home, if you have hardwood floors, it's pretty hard to kneel on a hardwood floor especially if you're a little bit new to this. And then in addition to that, I've really been inspired by textured flooring. And this isn't a product that really exists out there yet that I see, \xa0but I think there's a way for our flooring to have a lot more texture to it and this makes our bodies stronger over time but the various textured options for this today, again, are kind of industrial or hideous looking. And by the same token, making something more beautiful, you'll be less afraid to show it to other people or just have it in your daily life. So that way 5 minutes of standing on some better flooring and your body is more awake and alive. I just believe that the objects around us all the time can actually be designed to make us feel better, be stronger, and be happier."", ""KATY: I agree 100% and I'm glad you are out there doing what you do.

All bodies are welcome here. Are you ready to get moving?', 'Music', 'KATY: \xa0There’s a phrase I’ve been thinking a lot about lately: ""In it for the long haul."" It means to commit, to stay with something, what it takes to see it through. We can think about commitment in all kinds of ways. There are long-term relationships of all kinds. There\'s writing a book. Right? That also requires staying in it for the long haul. And how do you do it? How do you stay in for the long haul? Do you just keep showing up and time passes, and the next thing you know, you’ve been in it… whatever it is … for the long haul? But maybe it’s probably more purposeful than that. If things that work over the long haul then it\'s more than just your presence over time. So you doing an active thing over and over again to be in it for the long haul.', 'Take, for instance, long-distance walking. And I imagine that most of you knew that I was going to get around to mentioning long distance walking eventually! So I do a lot of lot of long distance walking. I just got done doing an urban 20-miler last week as research for an upcoming project. \xa0And PS it is totally different 20 urban miles, than 20 hiking miles in a rural setting. And I think long distance walking is actually vitally important, both in my life and for the human species as a group. So I am excited to interview a guest - no not me - who has a lot to say about long distance walking. And we’ll hear some of her tips, and I’ll have a few of my own to share as well, obviously.', ""And it's signed"", ""So if you were here, Zoe, my first question would be what do you mean by backbending. And if you mean having your feet on the ground with your hands also on the ground behind you with your body arched up in between, I would say no, I would not put that in the category of natural movement as I use the term. \xa0Which are motions found in nature at a certain consistency, volume, and distribution. So, any motions say, or some human bodies can do isn't part of that definition. Meaning I'm delineating between motions the body can do because of their natural hard and software motions versus motions you'd actually find ancestrally. Not an outlier, per se. \xa0And note, this isn't a judgement on a move being good or bad or anything. I just wouldn't categorize it as a movement found in nature. Although as I was thinking about your question, a fun side-note for me. I don't know how it is for you listeners. Maybe also if you're a cultural or physical anthropologist if a backbend has become a human movement in a particular culture, it could end up being that every culture has its own set of motions required for the success of that culture. \xa0And a backbend could be in that group. But again, I'm just using the term natural movement differently. Now if you didn't mean backbend but just extension of the spine... So if everyone stands up and if you shift your hips back over your heels. All right? So you're gonna start with a vertical leg where your pelvis is stacked over the back of your foot and not over your toes. So you're gonna start to lean back, but you're not going to let the pelvis thrust forward, right? So there's a tendency when we lean back for the hips to go forward too. So I want you to keep your pelvis where it is. Keep your hips where they started. And start to lean back. I'm gonna move away from the mic. \xa0And you're gonna start extending your spine. So you will, this is where it gets a little bit challenging. You're not going to let the rib cage thrust. Your rib cage is going to rotate backwards. It's gonna sit backwards a little bit but I need you to know the difference between your rib cage tipping backwards through spinal extension or your rib cage just sliding forward at the bottom, which is - it wouldn't really be that you articulated each vertebra, it would be that you've really articulated one a great amount and the others not so much. So you are gonna still drop your ribs even as you start to lean back and into this extension or slight backbend, is probably how I would use to quantify it differently than backbend being a full arch. So this whole body's final extension motion. That's with your feet planted and you've leaned as far back as you can go. Maybe even let your head go back. You're not gonna let it drop back. You're gonna control it. \xa0But you've got that extension. This whole body's final extension motion is made up of each vertebrae extending a little bit. And I do think that this motion, vertebral extension, is natural in the sense that many movements done day to day in nature would call on vertebral extension. Although maybe it wouldn't be the entire spine done at once the way we practice it as an exercise. So, if I'm thinking stack your life principles, I would say that picking up heavy things is where I use it a lot. And I'm thinking of moving rocks. We just build a rock wall from river rocks around our house. And we just got done training with the folks at MovNat. And took a sort of deadlift move. I think lots of people would do a deadlift in a gym. They'll hip hinge, and they'll move forward, bending over at the hip, usually with a weighted bar and then stand back up. So we took that hip hinge to lifting and moving heavy planting pots and squash. We had some really big heavy squash. \xa0Just to think about if you're going out to the pumpkin patch, there would be a stack your life motion. So a good lifting technique uses spinal extension pretty naturally. Because keep in mind that spinal extension being a natural movement doesn't say anything about the degrees of extension that are natural. So just because extension is natural doesn't imply that full end range would be called upon that frequently or even at all. So that's always my call to people studying and teaching movement. If we could communicate in terms of numbers or amounts, things would be less conflated, I think. So anyway, imagine if you were bending over to pick up something off the ground and you kind of centered your body to it, right? So there's not an element of twist yet. When you would go to pick it up, you would usually have an amount of extension in your spine. The amount of extension you have in your spine really will depend on what you are lifting and where you had to move it. But for me, that's where I will often call on the musculature of my back. And if you go back to that standing backbend and leaning back, you're not doing a ton of - it's not really weighted. That backbend is really more a range of motion. You're able to get the range of motion, but the work's more on the front of your body. \xa0\xa0You'll usually feel it in your abdomen. Maybe the fronts of your thighs. When you're bent over though, say you're at 90 degrees with your torso to the floor ... and sorry if my voice is moving around. I'm actually doing this. I'm such a mover as I teach which makes teaching via podcast very challenging... I'm all the way down here by the floor. When you're at 90 degrees now your spine is not only going for that extension motion but that extension motion, those extensors are carrying the weight of your spine. Where they're not doing it through that same backbend. So now you have a question of what ... it's not even the motion that's particularly nourishing. It's the load. Right? So I can have a backbending motion that is the same as me standing, versus me, carrying a 40-pound pot. And those moves are different. And so it's challenging I think to only think in terms of range of motion and mobility. I think it's easier to think in terms of load because then you can figure out oh, a backbend is a completely different load than me being able to pick up something 40 lbs and not only carry it with my legs and my arms but to have my spine be able to extend and carry that load. So carrying heavy stuff, Zoe, carrying heavy stuff would be the forward answer. And if you wade through that 3000 or 5000 word answer, well done."", ""Ok, that was a great question. \xa0Hopefully there's a little bit of clarity there. \xa0Ok, we're gonna get to our interview now, but I just wanted to throw a shout out to our sponsors, the Dynamic Collective. \xa0Later on in this episode, we're gonna meet Mike Dally of "", ' and find out what drives him over the long haul. Earth Runners is a member of our Dynamic Collective of companies that support this podcast. Thank you Dynamic Collective! These companies are ', ', ', ', and ', '. These are all minimal shoe companies, as well as ', ', and then ', ' which makes beautiful minimal home furnishings. I interviewed Tyler from Venn in the last episode. I know their products very well. And you may, too. And this season, we’ve been getting to know the people behind the products. I really love this kind of side interview series. \xa0I feel like I am friends with all of the people who are making things I depend on. There are also so many fascinating journeys out there that I hope as people are listening and just thinking about their life and their work, that they can just see. Like I feel like when I was trying to figure out what I would do that I just had a very narrow model of what was possible. So I just like seeing all the possibilities out there.', ""DAMI: Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to talk to your listeners."", ""KATY: Yes I'm very excited. \xa0So just a little bit of background. When you write books it's like, it's hard enough to write it and then it's maybe even more challenging to edit it after an editor has gone through it. \xa0But then you have to get other people to read it before it's even out so that you've got blurbs and other people who are in your same industry just kind of summing up maybe key points who the book is for and so I was asked to do a blurb for your book. And it was right along the same time as I was finishing up "", '. Or maybe I was in the...', 'DAMI: \xa0Yes it was out already.', 'KATY: Ok, so publicity of doing ', "", so I'm not sure if you reached out on Twitter or what other of these amazing social media connectors, but I was very excited to have this book because "", "" has all these correctives and lifestyle adjustments to get you moving more. \xa0And then it's like Dami had written really like part two. "", 'DAMI: Yes.', ""KATY: Which is the way I looked at it. \xa0Now that you're inspired, everyone but certainly goldeners, right? \xa0There's not that many books written for people over 50 explicitly. And so I want to - before we get into that - I want to talk about how walking and hiking became a thing for you."", 'DAMI: Oh yes. Well, I mean I\'ve walked all my life. I grew up in Holland and without a car. So that wasn\'t anything new, but it became a thing, as you said, bigger thing, when my life fell apart in my late 50s. And my husband had a progressive illness and I lost him quite soon after that. \xa0And so when your life falls apart what better thing to do, at least in my book, is to go for a walk and clear your head and figure out, ""now what do I do with my life? How do I go about this?"" Because I felt very off balance. As many older women that I talk to now, they experience that when you lose a life partner you\'re like somebody ripped half of your body off and you\'re literally not walking in balance. So a walk is good was one of the better things I could do. And that got me started on what incredibly beneficial walking and I went to the Himalayas. I didn\'t just like walk around the block.', 'KATY: No.', 'DAMI: \xa0And I hiked in the high mountains. I wanted to truly - I wanted to get lost.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""DAMI: I didn't want to come back. And I found what I was made of. \xa0I found what it did for me. And so I'm actually working on a memoir about that trip right now. Hopefully that will come out next year. But I really saw the benefits of it, and I thought, I just started using it in my daily life to deal with depression, deal with unhappiness. And I became a hiker and a backpacker. And I started doing the long trail which is not something necessarily that you promote but what I have found, you know, reading your books is like, it's a perfect marriage of these two. Because a lot of people say well I can't walk that far. \xa0Go read Katy first and do what she says and then you'll become somebody who can walk too and use it for other purposes."", ""KATY: Yeah. \xa0I think that the end goal - the point is to kind of reclaim this. \xa0There's a lot of terms for it - rewilding or being able to engage in nature with not much more than your physical self, right? \xa0In the way that humans have for a long period of time. And so definitely long distance walking is a category of natural movement that we cover, and I'm just so pleased. \xa0I have a question. I can see now how walking trekking wilderness engagement became your thing, your salve, almost, right?"", 'DAMI: Right.', 'KATY: \xa0Where you were.', 'DAMI: Yes it was.', 'KATY: How did you make that leap to then want to help others do it? \xa0', 'DAMI: Well I was... no, I don\'t think I was quite retired. I was teaching local women about - \xa0a small class about backpacking for women. Because as you do it, you talk to others, and you realized a lot of them don\'t have the gear, they don\'t know how to go about it. So I said I\'ll do a six-week class. And I put material together and then I thought, I need to have a little book. You know if this is - if we\'re gonna do this, rather than all of these handouts. So I just decided one November to just start writing a little handbook that we could use. And I wrote the handbook. I realized that doing classes as I was here locally was a lot of hard work and then I started thinking a lot more about reaching a larger audience with it. And I thought maybe I can do online seminars. And that was all new stuff for me. So I started thinking bigger, and that\'s how the book grew. And as I was writing it and talked to my publisher, she said: ""oh you know, we need to spice it up."" \xa0And ""I want to hear your stories."" I had stories in there already to encourage people. But then we added all my journal entries and really made it a book that people can just pick up, enter anywhere. That\'s what a lot of my readers say: ""I can just have it laying there, open it up and I read something that\'s like Oh I hadn\'t thought about that."" Or so it\'s very accessible at all points of the book. That\'s what happened.', ""KATY: It is very accessible. \xa0And I think there's a lot of people timid around nature. Anytime I do a post on me being out in nature the bulk of the response is just how scary so many people find some element - whether it's bugs or weather or just some danger. They just perceive so much danger out there. So I have suggested - if you're feeling too timid, at least start reading the journals and stories of people who have overcome that fear and who have - it's not just simply overcoming fear. You've adapted. \xa0You've increased your ability to know what nature is doing and so it is less fearful when you have knowledge. And experiential knowledge all the better."", 'DAMI: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: \xa0So books are so funny. There's how to books. And then there's memoirs. And I would say that Walking Gone Wild is definitely a how-to book, but it had been spiced up. So well done for your editor. Just because you are sharing your experience which grounds the book into a real person did this."", 'DAMI: Yes.', 'KATY: And a real person transitioned from not doing it to being able to do it which is way different than a person who has always done it. \xa0Writing a book, I find value in someone who has changed - who has changed through the process. Their work has emerged because of their personal journey. \xa0I appreciate that perspective quite a bit.', 'DAMI: Right. I had something to say about that. About people and their fear of going out and all the different things they imagine. The truth is, I am always fearful. Or I\'m not a fearful person. But when you prepare for a big trip or to go out into the wild, there\'s an anxiety. It\'s like each time you have to make a transition from this sort of safe, you know, seemingly safe - these days it isn\'t - home environment to where you\'re unprotected and vulnerable. But soon, and this is what I\'m so passionate about, come with me. Feel it. \xa0As soon as you\'re walking and breathing and you\'re out there, that fear just drops. Once you have one day under your belt, it\'s like, ""Oh. I belong here."" And that was, I think, the greatest discovery that I had that I feel actually protected by trees and the natural world. This is my world. And we\'ve lost that in our society. People are just - they\'ve been cut off from that. And that is so sad.', 'KATY: So your work focuses mainly on women over the age of 50. Why did you choose that group?', ""DAMI: \xa0Because I think we're underserved and I know the group."", 'KATY: Right.', ""DAMI: \xa0I'm 71."", 'KATY: Intimately.', 'DAMI: And when I look for hiking and guiding books, there isn\'t one for women specifically. And also, there are certain things that happen in women\'s bodies after menopause. \xa0And those are the things that I address in the book. And when a woman says - when I did a presentation a couple weeks ago - she says, ""Oh thank you. I\'m 50. I had no idea that you could do this. I thought I was just on a downhill.""', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""DAMI: And I'm going no we're not on a downhill."", ""KATY: You're not on a downhill. You are not!"", ""DAMI: No! \xa0And for women especially. That's why, you know, men can learn from this too, but men operate differently. But women have these sort of boosts that they get. That testosterone thing that happens after you've been done - after you're done with menopause. There's an energy that kind of cuts lose which makes some of these what they call the badass women who want to go out and find out what they're worth - what their bodies can do. \xa0And I think it speaks to women like that."", ""KATY: Yeah. Well, I definitely feel - I feel like your book is valuable for anyone who just, like you said, that idea that I belong here in the natural world. \xa0I think that your book is a tool for any human being interested in dipping a toe at first, right. It's very step wise."", ""DAMI: Yes. That's what I did. What I do is not for everyone. And I always say that. This is not for everyone. Because of what you have done in your life, your body, you know not everybody can do what I do. If you've been an athlete all your life? Go for it. \xa0You can probably do this. But if you've never even walked, let's set a different goal here at this point. But that doesn't mean that it can't benefit, as you say in your books. It makes you a healthier person who can enjoy life as we age. We are going to age. But how we age, that's our choice."", 'KATY: It says: How to lose your age on the trail. So what does that mean to you?', 'DAMI: \xa0Well, it\'s actually literal, but it\'s also a metaphor. Because you find you build this confidence when you walk, when you hike, day hikes, regularly. If you don\'t have to think twice about going out for a 5 to 8-mile hike, you are a confident person at 65. And that makes you someone who fits in a younger category. You know? \xa0You\'re not always wondering about will it be dangerous or can I do it. No, I\'m gonna go do this. So in your mind you lose a sense of age. I have that story in my book where I meet this woman who happens to be my same age, and they go, ""well she looks pretty - she must be quite old doing this"" and then when I find out how old she is I\'m going, ""Do I look like that? I don\'t feel like that."" \xa0I feel like I\'m 35 right now.', 'KATY: Right.', ""DAMI: \xa0So that's how you lose your age. But literally, I mean the research and I've put that in my book shows that it slows down aging if you move and walk daily. And I am a lot more stiff when I'm at home."", 'KATY: Right.', ""DAMI: When I'm on the trail for a couple of weeks, and I'm just walking and crouching and bending and doing all that stuff all day, I am not stiff in the mornings or at night. Now I try to not sit that much. But we end up sitting. We sit in chairs. And I am a lot more stiff now than when I'm on the trail. So that should tell you. And the other thing that I found out, I don't know that, I don't think it's in my book is by hiking and backpacking and carrying so much, my bone density which was at osteopenia and a lot of women are concerned about it, their bone density. \xa0Mine has increased in the last four years by 3.75%."", ""KATY: Yeah. Huge! \xa0Take heed everyone. \xa0Listen. Listen to what Dami is saying. \xa0Ok, so I feel like every now who is listening is nodding and going ok, yes, all right. So we want to give - we're each gonna give 3 action items. These are actions that anyone listening can take now in whatever form to help support this, I'm gonna call it long distance nature walking. But again, remember it's scaleable. So if you have never done 5 miles, long distance walking is five miles right now to you. Or 3. \xa0So you just have to scale the words. We're not talking about a 500 mile or 1000 mile through hike. It's just look at where you're moving right now and then just add some to it, and that's the marker that we're suggesting."", 'DAMI: \xa0Well, the first thing is make sure your body\'s in working order. And you know, if you have never walked and I put it in my book, check with your physician. \xa0Do not just start in and then hurt yourself. You can develop strains, sprains, cracks in your bones from doing too much at once. Your enthusiasm may be there but maybe your body can\'t. Maybe you have underlying things that you don\'t even know about, and then you put the stress on it. \xa0And as we\'re older we need to be responsible about that. Young too. But younger people can often do more. They can take on those challenges. But at our age, we need to really make sure am I in good enough shape to go do this. And your doctor will tell you, ""yeah you can walk five miles, or you can do more than that."" \xa0So then you have that. Also as you say, can you do all these different moves? You\'re not just upright. You\'re going to be stepping up and crouching at times and so start doing exercises and get your body aligned. If your body isn\'t aligned, walking is not going to be pleasant. Now we all have things that aren\'t working very well anymore in our late 50s, and it just gets worse. \xa0So you find ways of adapting to deal with things. I have a leg that is not completely straight because of an ACL that I had replaced 20 years ago. And it\'s showing up as you age because you\'re not walking completely balanced. So, I have to find ways to make that work. I have to be aware of that and not overdo it. But as a friend of mine says, well it hurts if I don\'t walk, so I might as well walk and then it hurts also. I know what to do about it. So that\'s the first important thing. Get your body in working order, whatever that takes. ', ""KATY: \xa0That is a great tip. Yes, it's a delicate balance between getting all your parts strong enough to walk before you start walking because sometimes some of the parts are only strengthened through walking. So just everyone out there listening, you're gonna have to kind of self-experiment a little bit. I don't want everyone to feel like they have to stay in at home practicing their corrective exercises to adjust all of their parts before they take a step. Because the steps are where you identify the pieces."", 'DAMI: Absolutely.', ""KATY: \xa0And you might be perfectly great at 8 miles, but once you start going to 12 miles it's something that wasn't bothering you at 8 miles starts to and then you have to revisit those foundational moves, exercises, the stuff that you find a lot more in my work. So just keep in mind it's not one and then the other. It's a relationship that you will keep visiting. Even me. \xa0It takes me to do 30 or 40 miles before I realize a part that is different than its kind of symmetrical part. Like one hip or one side of my SI joint or whatever. And it's only through engaging in volume that I identify it and then know what to do or how to adjust the rest of my time. So it's just, again, it's that relationship. "", 'DAMI: Right.', ""KATY: \xa0It's the feet. It is the feet. \xa0So if you're trying to figure out how to get your body in working order, I suggest starting with the feet and the ankles. That's why "", "" Because I think you can go a long way in your alignment, your whole body gait, just by dealing with your feet and the ankles which keeps it from being overwhelming. And pay attention to red flags that come up. Don't ignore red flags. \xa0You don't just sit down because of them. But you want to note them, and in your training time, I know you recommend lots of training, that you have training specific to whatever flag has come up for you. "", ""DAMI: Ok, so the next tip is training, and you already said it. \xa0You know, for some people it may be training one mile a day. For others, it's five miles a day or every other day. And if you want to go on the long hikes you've got to really put a program together. But if you want to become a walker and be comfortable, you have to do it. And adding to that, so it's not just walking that will straighten everything out, like you said. \xa0You do your foot exercises. You do your pilates or whatever you do to strengthen all the parts of your body that are involved in movement to be able to take the load and to get the endurance. And then the third part is your aerobic training. I became a rower in my late 50s. And I thank, I am thankful when I'm climbing at 13,000 feet, six miles up, I thank my rowing training where we do these long steady workouts at a low rating for my heart that my heart can take it. So for altitude, there's very specific training that you can do. So you have to become comfortable with training. And then the other part is strength training. I don't know if you talk much about that in your book. But you know after 50 ... it starts after 30 anyway ... but after 50 you have to really adopt - it's like a new religion - I have to do my strength training two or three times a week, or you lose muscle. There's no way around it."", ""DAMI: Yep. And as I say to people, walk to your store, get your groceries. But get a backpack. Put them in there. If you can't carry a week's worth, go more frequently and carry smaller loads until you can do it. If you want to do it that way."", 'KATY: \xa0\xa0Yeah. So this second tip is start carrying more stuff in your daily life. And it fits into the training. I can see a lot of people saying ""I don\'t have time to do all this training."" \xa0And I was like, just walk to the store. Load up your groceries and walk back. Because if you can\'t do that comfortably, then that\'s the point at which you train. Because putting a bunch of gear on your back and then trying to go longer and farther is only going to be that skill that you can\'t do right now heightened. The magnitude is greatly increased. So you can train throughout your life and remember that this trekking, these long walks that we\'re talking about, isn\'t really only walking. It\'s bending, carrying, stooping, stepping high, stepping low, uphill, downhill, there\'s a lot of variance to it. And so when you train, you want to make sure that you can do it with weight also on your body. So just look for that more complex terrain as you\'re walking home from the store or wherever else you\'re going to carry your, I don\'t know if you\'re going out to get pumpkins for the holiday right now that you can think about walking there and carrying them back. And then learning great technique for carrying. Alignment isn\'t only about how you\'re walking and standing. There are ways to wear your backpack. There are ways to carry and lift loads in your arms and with your legs that are more advantageous in other ways. So you want to just invest in a little education that gives you more sustainability and also regeneration of your form as you\'re starting to add the volume of movement.', ""DAMI: \xa0I agree. So you know, I always say I don't do my strength training in the summer. But that's not true. In the summer I am outside, I'm gardening. I'm doing all kinds of things that involve weight. And I keep that in my life. Because I don't particularly like the gym or to go to certain reps or anything. I want it to be a natural part of my life. So I totally agree with you."", 'DAMI: The third one is to gather your gear. If you want to become a walker, it starts with your footwear, your clothing, and I always say to people, if you really want to become a walker, have the gear that doesn\'t stop you from going outside when it\'s raining or when it\'s too hot or when it\'s too cold. That it\'s right there by the front door. You know you have the shoes for it, or you have traction devices. \xa0I mean I go hiking in the snow. I have gear for that. I don\'t want to be stopped by weather. And then if you\'re thinking about, of course, going for day hikes or longer hikes, you need to gather stuff for that. And one of the important things is that if you\'re going outside of cellphone range that you have some kind of personal locator, you have a medical kit, you have the real basics to start taking care of yourself in case you fall, you trip, something happens. I always carry all that with me, and I have had to help many other people, and I had the right thing in my backpack. And people don\'t think about taking - ""Oh I\'m just going for a little hike up in the hills here or down the beach"" I just carry my backpack, and there\'s a little weight in it, and so I\'m always carrying a little weight on my back when I do that.', ""KATY: Yeah. For those of you if it's sounding expensive just to be able to go outside and move, just keep in mind, used gear. Fortunately, I live in a very outdoorsy area. So this might be more challenging to find in more urban areas, although maybe not."", ""DAMI: No I don't think so anymore."", ""KATY: \xa0Look for gear swaps. Look at garage sales. \xa0We pick up all of our outdoor gear second hand for very little money. But again, it helps when you've got communities of people. So reach out to your local hiking groups and ask. They usually hold gear swaps. If you have kids, nature organizations. Feel free to reach out. \xa0Our library lets out, leases out, safety gear for Backcountry. So you don't have to buy guides and compasses. They rent it out. In the same way that you can check out a book, you can check out gear. So before you feel an obstacle or a barrier, like you can't afford it, there's a lot of people out there who recognize that this is a barrier who have taken steps to keep it from being such a big barrier. So make sure you look into that as well. \xa0"", 'DAMI: Yes.', ""There's a lot of practices, and there's the practice of movements and how to stand and how to move in an optimal way and the optimal gear. But sometimes we get so used to being super comfortable to have everything that we could possibly want at your fingertips, the more equipment or gear that that takes or the less variance of the situation in which you feel comfortable, that becomes sort of a cast. Right? If you have this huge load that you can't be comfortable without seven varieties of a particular food, or whatever, then that preference for having everything that you want at all times really becomes a limitation on where you can go and for how long. And so one of the things that I've practiced on a 20-mile walk, for example, is I'll take water. I mean I won't take a huge camel bag, but I'll take the amount of water that I feel comfortable with. I'm not saturated in water. And I'll take a couple snacks, but I won't pack three meals if I'm going to be out for eight hours. \xa0I can be ok without eating every two hours. It took me a long time to be comfortable. And the way that you become more comfortable is - they'll talk about it in nature education - is finding your edge. And what Wilderness does or Nature Immersion or even going to a park without bringing a cooler behind you is that you learn how to be ok without having everything that you need and want when you want it. And so that's a personal growth."", ""DAMI: Yeah. You're talking about changing mindsets. And I am so into that."", 'KATY: Right. Yeah. And so I think that when you do through hikes or long hikes or backpack packing or even camping...', 'DAMI: Yeah.', ""KATY: ... you learn how to be comfortable with less. And so are you practicing discomfort or are you learning how to be more comfortable. It's kind of maybe a semantic argument at that point, but it is essential to say, you really want to look at what you require to be comfortable physically. And if that stuff is just a huge pile of stuff behind you, it means that you can't go very far from that space. And so most of us have a range that we could play with through experiencing and growing in the face of not having those things which then actually, it's like minimalism or is it maximalism? \xa0Because now you've minimized the stuff, but you've maximized the potential experiences. So that's my third tip for going out for long periods of time."", 'DAMI: Yeah. And hang with people who do it. Because if you hang out with people who are afraid and especially in my age group of getting hurt and they just limit their exposure, then they will never find out that they can actually do it just fine. So...', 'KATY: Learn from your peers.', 'DAMI: And choose your peers wisely.', ""KATY: Right. Well, this has been wonderful. I really hope your book does well. I hope that people go out and get this book, read it themselves, share with their friends and family that they'd like to be outside again. I feel like it's all ages, all people could benefit from this book."", 'DAMI: Very much.', ""KATY: Let me tell you the title again. It's Walking Gone Wild: How to lose your age on the trail. You can find more about Dami at, I'm gonna give you her website.

I share just tips about walking, but in the group people are teaming up together to find local hiking groups or to create them. They share hikes that they do.

WalkingWomen50plus."", ""KATY: And you're going to be presenting at REI in the Bay area on February. Can you tell me about that?"", ""DAMI: Actually yes. And the last week of February I'm going to be in Santa Rosa, in Corte Madera, and in Berkley. \xa0Three presentations that I have lined up right now. So people in the bay area they can come listen to me. I'm working on some other ones for Portland probably late November, but I don't have exact dates yet, but they would be announced on my Facebook page. So if you're interested in finding out about that, that's also a possibility."", 'KATY: Well, Dami thank you so much for coming on. It was lovely talking to you.', 'DAMI: Well I very much enjoyed it and happy walking to all of you.', "" So today's maker spotlight is on "", "". They're a minimal sandal company founded by Michael Dally."", 'Michael Dally has always enjoyed the flow state achieved in creating functional gadgetry to assist in his quest for growth and betterment. And I can already tell from reading this bio - this is going to be a cool interview! This disposition has led him down the paths of health, fitness, and engineering resulting in the founding of Earth Runners in 2012.', 'Michael, welcome to Move Your DNA!', ""MICHAEL: \xa0\xa0Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure."", 'KATY: Ok, so what happened in 2012 and the years leading up to it. How did you get to develop Earth Runners?', ""MICHAEL: As I grew up I was a kid in sports. I was kind of in a jock family of sorts. And I was also the kid in the garage always very attracted to project - it just didn't exist. Then college came around. It was like, what are you going to do? \xa0It seemed like an engineering agree would kind of back my pursuit of wanting to create things in the world and studied Mechanical Engineer at San Diego State. And was competing with what felt like against calculator brains. And I was more like the creative. So it was very challenging. And I made it through. I feel like it kind of - that sedentary kind of lifestyle took a toll on my body and when I graduated I was so over the concept of actually being an engineer and just wanted to get back to my creative pursuits. So I took a year off. I told myself I wasn't going to do anything for at least a year. And towards the end of college, I kind of got more and more into alternative, kind of progressive health. And so I continued to study that after college. And then a sequence of events after that led to Earth Runners. Read the book "", ' which a lot of people have heard about. And then also the book ', '. Basically discussing our lost connection with the earth as a human species. And then so I had this idea of earthing back in my mind which made a lot of sense to me. And this kind of movement of minimal footwear and people taking it as far as minimalist running sandals. And so one day I was with a buddy of mine, and we taped on a pair of flip-flop sandals using athletic tape. Just your typical ankle tape job that you would get if you had a busted ankle and just fell in love with the experience of running barefoot-esque through the forest in very little footwear - breeze between the toes. And just felt very primal to me. And I feel like I have a pretty strong primal streak in my personal DNA, so it was just like instant love at first experience. So I kind of studied the marketplace of existing minimal footwear sandals on the market and kind of found a niche of crossing the concept of a minimalist adventure sandal with a conductive conduit through the sandal itself allowing for connection between the human body and the skin of the earth. \xa0So that kind of was the set-up. And then started playing around with different earthing adventure sandal designs. And a lady friend of mine who I had kind of just been collaborating with via email a little bit back and forth, I presented the idea to her. And she kind of classified herself as an electrosensitive type of person, so she really saw the demand. And I feel like she saw it before I saw it. And she created the support system. She was kind of like a life coach of sorts, and she just gave me that encouragement because pretty much everyone else in my life was just like, ""Yeah I don\'t know about that. Sounds pretty far-fetched.""', ""KATY: You're just taping sandals onto your shoes and changing careers."", 'MICHAEL: \xa0Yeah. ""You just graduated with an engineering degree and have so many options, and you\'re gonna do this?"" \xa0And I was like, ""yep.""', ""KATY: You know this is funny because I have come across and hung out with and talked with probably about four mechanical engineers in the last 30 days. All of them who had both just a natural affinity for mechanical engineering. Like that is a natural strength or intelligence for them. They see the way things go together. They kind of feel and think in terms of forces. \xa0But, they also were creatives at the same time who had these other outlets. And all of them left mechanical engineering as a field because they found the way that they could express their mechanical intelligence really encroaching on this other equally valid part of them. And almost all of them basically just took mechanical engineering into - the same thing for me. I left physics and mathematics because I was like, there's no grounding in the real world, the touching world, the moving world, the physical world. It was all this very theoretical and lines, and on paper and on computers and with symbols and nothing that met my equal part of me that was my bio ... my biology, living systems, and life and nature. So just for anyone out there who thinks that you go to college to study a thing and then go get a job based on that thing - like you studied engineering and thus you have to be an engineer - \xa0I think that maybe we just need to talk about that. Sometimes we study a thing and the way you're going to apply it you don't know yet. And that there's lots of options available. So anyway, that's what I picked up on for you there."", 'MICHAEL: The definitely was very much the case. And I feel fortunate to have basically been educated in that foundation because there\'s a few things I learned here and there and probably more than I even give credibility to. But it was also the main thing - I feel like I took away from college - it was the confidence to take on projects that seemed way more daunting than I thought I could ever conquer. At the beginning, I was like, ""Yeah I\'ll give this a try. We\'ll see what happens."" And I was just surprised. Every year, I guess I\'m still in it.', ""KATY: Still making Earth Runners. So what has surprised you about - so I guess from the engineering perspective, I had no idea that this would happen when you went to make footwear. Or I guess from the other side, the flip side, like marketing or entrepreneurship. Like actually starting a company. What's been the most surprising thing about developing Earth Runners."", ""MICHAEL: That's a good question. I would say surprising...the way I'm going to interpret that is challenging. What's been the most challenging. The most unanticipated facet of the whole thing."", 'KATY: Sure.', ""MICHAEL: Which has just been scaling up and creating a team. \xa0I work very well independently. I'm easily distracted, so it's just nice to have my space of focus on what I'm doing. But it's been forced upon me that I have to work with a team, collaborate with people to grow this. It's one thing to train people whichI'm pretty good at - finding people and connecting with people. All things I'm pretty good at. But when it comes to managing people, it's just like, I was always just the person who never really took praise very well. This is what you're supposed to do. I'm gonna go do it."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""MICHAEL: And I don't really want thing... I don't want feedback that doesn't feel authentic. So for me to, I don't know, just like me being that person and being a manager. A manager is just ... it's positive reinforcement. And always telling people what to do and what not to do. I never liked being told what to do, so it's been a little challenging for me to grow into that role. But I think it's the best kind of situation for me. Because it's kind of making me focus on my weaknesses, I would say. "", 'KATY: Yeah. Personal development through a shoe company.', 'MICHAEL: Yeah, spiritual development.', ""KATY: Exactly. Ok, this other word keeps popping out at me. Functional gadgetry. So I have this idea of technology, and I think technology as a term has kind of been co-opted to mean electronics. \xa0But the way that I understand a technology is really taking something that didn't exist before. Or taking elements and making something new that didn't exist before. What is a functional gadget? Are you saying that your shoes are a functional gadget?"", ""MICHAEL: Yeah. I mean it kind of was the best phrase that kind of sat in that sentence. And the other kind of funny note about the birthplace of Earth Runners was that it started in my parent's garage in the Silicon Valley. And the Silicon Valley is surrounded by mountains that are beautiful. So it was like this very progressive, grindy, innovative place with a lot of access to nature. So it was just kind of the manifestation of its surroundings. And yes, I would say it is a gadget. I feel like you talk about it in your books of just the footwear in general's technology. Even if you go to the most basic of footwear like a minimalist sandal, it's still a technology."", 'KATY: Yeah.', 'MICHAEL: And a gadget. Like you said, you had some association with electronics with it. And we do have an electronic component to our sandals. So that kind of brings it more into the realm of gadgetry. And that was kind of describing not only the sandals but all my project.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""MICHAEL: And it's like I'm trying to create something that's functional that I can use and not just art that's un-useful."", 'KATY: I can just hear a bunch of artists out there saying ""What? Art\'s not useful."" \xa0But these are terms. We are in a critical place right now as a species. Or at least as a culture - like a group of a species who are behaving in a particular way. So I just looked it up right now. So technology comes from the Greek word that is in Greek that I can\'t read. But it means science craft. So it\'s the art, skill, or cunning of hand. So I\'m thinking, I just did a big interview with a technology company that I think everyone would agree is a technology. \xa0And talking about what decisions our family has made in light of this tremendous amount of technology. And I was like, well you\'re gonna have to define technology for me because I think of it as anything created that didn\'t really exist without human\'s fashioning it to make it this thing. So we\'ve kind of segmented technology to mean electronics. So we wouldn\'t put shoes in a technology although they are still the same. So I think there\'s going to be a time where in order for these conversations to progress, we\'re going to have to find what constitutes a technology and I think I\'ve probably talked about it before probably in other podcasts which is we might have to start defining things by the wake that they leave behind them. Right? BEcause there\'s a big difference between a mass-produced shoe and something that someone has just kind of made out of fewer parts in their own home. You know what I mean? \xa0That\'s just my - that\'s my own interests kind of going off on a tangent right now. So let\'s go back to Earth Runners. You have some new products in the pipeline? You have some new functional gadgetry that maybe you want to talk about? Like maybe a new performance sandal? And I was excited to see you might be doing stuff for kids. So what can you tell us now about that?', 'MICHAEL: You know what\'s funny is I feel like we\'ve been connected for three to four years now. And about two\xa0years back you had been wearing our sandals for a while, and I\'m always \xa0kind of prodding people, ""you can tell me what you like about it, but I want you to really tell me what you don\'t like about it.""', ""KATY: It's more helpful. Right."", 'MICHAEL: It\'s way more helpful. And I was like, what could be better? \xa0And you were, very simply, ""better traction."" And I was like, ""I feel you."" ', ""KATY: On the footbed. That was on the actual part that the foot's on, yeah?"", ""MICHAEL: Well there's two components to that. There's the foot traction on the sandal bedding, and there's the sandal tread on the earth, and I've been working on both. WE've had the canvas top which we call our Earth Grip top in circulation now for about 18 months, and that really helps with foot traction on the sandal, wet and dry."", 'KATY: Yeah.', 'MICHAEL: Which is great. But then there\'s also the traction of the sole onto the earth in loose gravel and wet rock applications which are probably some of the most difficult. And I\'ve honestly experimented I would say with hundreds of different treads. It\'s slightly sad because there\'s quite a bit of waste in that scenario, but I feel like that\'s kind of what it takes to come up with new combinations of existing materials. Kind of like what you were describing with technology. And we\'ve landed on something I\'m really really excited about. This really grippy outsole. It\'s got like a profile and a frequency of tread pattern that really grips into the earth. And those two applications I was describing and the actual compound itself is very sticky but also holds up very well over time. \xa0And I\'ve been testing them for the past six to ten months, and we\'re gonna get more people testing them very soon. It\'s one thing to find the materials and put them in these unique combinations. But then it\'s another task to develop the system to streamline it for manufacturing. And that\'s been the second - people even say that that\'s more than 50% of the development process. And that\'s what we\'re in right now is kind of ironing out that process. But yeah, really excited about that. Making the sandals kind of more adventure ready. Able to connect with the earth on more terrains. And like you also mentioned, the kids\' sandals. We recently had a poll with our audience, and it was like, ""What do we not offer that you would prefer us to offer?"" Like what do you want us to create? And it was crazy the feedback we got. I think it was...let\'s say we had like 100 different feedback points. At least 20-30% of them were children\'s sandals. That\'s a huge percentage.', 'KATY: Wow.', ""MICHAEL: So that's in the works. We're excited about it. We've been making those - we've made those in the past, but it just wasn't very streamlined because we were making them all custom and it took forever. And we couldn't really charge enough to make them - like a viable business situation for us. So now we're just making standard children's options and pretty excited about it."", ""KATY: Yeah. That is so challenging. There's a general idea that minimalist footwear should cost less than non-minimalist footwear. The idea being that a shoe is solely, that you're only charging based on the mass of a shoe. \xa0And not really paying the same amount of people to fashion them no matter what shape it is, etc. But children's shoes is a big deal because, like I feel like the investment in foot development, it's better to invest when they're younger than when they're older. When they're really setting ranges of motion and bone shape is really based on use. Yet kids need shoes ... they grow so quickly. Shoes get expensive. Shoes are way more expensive for kids because you're having to buy much greater volume. So I appreciate you coming on just kind of sharing some of the work that goes into making something that I forget non-makers might forget. You know, the idea that you're testing. You're sampling. You're seeing what fails. And you're going through many failures before what you end up bringing to market is brought. \xa0Anything else you want to let us know?"", ""MICHAEL: Not really. I mean, I just appreciate the opportunity to get on here and talk about our story. I mean I feel like it's something that's just been such a huge part of my personal story and it just keeps growing and getting out to more people. So I think it'll be interested for people to hear little tidbits of the backstory of me kind of utilizing my skills to leverage what I feel like is some of the most accessible technology out there to kind of assist in a healthy and happy lifestyle."", ""KATY: Yeah. Footwear is ubiquitous at least across our culture. I like talking to people who make shoes because almost everyone out there has an entire closet full of them and may have never thought about. But at least these listeners they're thinking about their shoes. Maybe even more than they should. All right. \xa0Well, Michael Dally is the founder of Earth Runners.

I want to go back to gratitude for a second. \xa0Gratitude that the microphone and the computer and the internet are, too, things that are fashioned from nature, that are allowing us to share this conversation with you. And that my intention is that you walk away with some easy ways to incorporate more of nature education into your life and feel inspired to do so. So look at that. We've already done - you already have a takeaway. Just add a bit of gratitude, you know, and you're way to ..."", 'SARAH T: \xa0Gratitude can change everything.', ""KATY: Exactly. \xa0Ok. So I guess before we go too far into the interview, there's a lot of terminology around various elements of nature education. So I made a list of some of them. There's forest school, nature school, nature kindergarten, forest kindergarten, coyote mentoring. What are some of the other terms that you might...?"", 'SARAH T: Those are the big ones.', 'SARAH G: I would agree.', 'SARAH T: Especially when you\'re talking about schools. There can be a lot of distinction between nature immersion, immersion curriculum. So these are different methods that people use in the actual ways of teaching. Coyote mentoring is one that we use as well. And then there\'s, you know, kind of some of the big names that people know out there: Montessori. Waldorf is kind of a big one out there - they use a lot of nature in their curriculum. \xa0So, and then there\'s like, oh Reggio Emilia - so these are, especially in the preschool and early childhood education models, a lot of these things come together and synthesize at certain points too. And they kind of create - every nature school has its own unique kind of combination of these things. So let\'s talk about some of those definitions. But before we even go there, I\'d like to open up our minds to the idea that nature is everywhere all the time. Just like you said - we\'re using a microphone. We\'re using computers. We\'re using showers. But all of these things come from nature and I think that one of the fundamentals of nature education as far as my experience goes is, reminding us that we are part of nature. And sometimes we have to go outside and immerse ourselves in a forest or a pond or a beach. \xa0And that is the gift so that we can remember that we are a part of nature. And come back to feeling at home in ourselves and in nature. However, once we get that kind of switch turned back on in our bodies - which is why it\'s so helpful to do this at such a young age - because children\'s belief formation is really malleable at this point. They are literally developing their beliefs every day. And that\'s why nature education at such a young age can be life changing in some ways. So I guess I just want to remind us that that malleability of our beliefs is available to us all the time and going out into nature, into the forest and things like that can be a way to help us turn that switch back on. We are part of nature. Everywhere we go is nature, even when we\'re in the jetliner, you know, 50,000 feet above the actual firm ground. However, we can also access nature through our beliefs, through our ideas, and honestly, in my experience, in gratitude. \xa0Even in the jetliner. Even if you don\'t spend a ton of time in the forest. Or you live a city and it\'s hard to get to a place that seems like a ""natural"" (quote unquote) environment, you can still access nature when you drink water. You are drinking a river. It\'s like a tiny stream the way I think of it. Or a tiny pond. And we are almost as modern people, have water within... we\'re extremely lucky. We have water within easy reach or easy walk most of the time. And so I think that\'s the first thing. Reminding us that nature is everywhere all the time. And I\'ll be talking a lot about that today. So then when we go into well how do we educate children in that belief? And there\'s nature schools which are kind of any form of a traditional school which uses a curriculum that\'s heavily based on nature. They meet in a building and maybe they take excursions outside. Or maybe they have a percentage of time that\'s spent outdoors or indoors. We belong to a regional association and we\'re creating a definition of what we mean by nature schools. And our state is piloting a program and it is also defining what nature school means and it\'s for us it\'s about 50% outdoor time at least and a strong environmental education component. So those are some pieces - nature school. Forest school often means that only maybe a little bit more time outside or often can even mean no building at all. Nature kindergarten or forest kindergarten often means that. Often forest kindergarten means no building - completely outdoor. Which is what we operate. We operate a totally outdoor program. What are some of the other ones that we were talking about?', ""SARAH S: \xa0So now I've gone over kind of the types of schools, right? There's nature school, there's forest school, there's forest kindergarten. And then those might be looking at is as a structure or maybe as an overhead of the - overhead's not the right word."", ""KATY: I'm thinking academic. Where you get what you think of as school stuff. And I say that as a different to like, bushcraft school. For some people think where nature school means where I would go on a weekend to learn bushcraft skills. And it is a school in that sense meaning I'm learning something. But I think the programs that we'll talk about today for the most part and the ones that you are operating are often times, instead of going to one type of school, you go to this type of school for children."", 'SARAH S: \xa0Right. And so I think what would be clarifying is what I was just describing - those are formats.', 'KATY: Format. Got it.', ""SARAH S: So when we're talking nature school, forest kindergarten, and forest school we're talking what is the format of the school. And that's what you're touching on."", 'KATY: Right.', ""SARAH S: I go to a building. I go to not a building. I go to this beach. Whatever the format is. \xa0And then now we'll talk about curriculum models. And so I mentioned a few early childhood education curriculum models that we're familiar with often is: \xa0Montessori, Reggio Emilia, Waldorf. Those are well-known curriculum models. There's also the forest kindergarten curriculum model. And that relies heavily on nature immersion which means you go out and you're just surrounded by nature. This could be, this can literally be a lot in the middle of a city or public park. Or it can be a forest or a pond somewhere that you go to. Then there's Immersion Curriculum which is you go out and you allow whatever comes up, the nature immersion, to be what you study. \xa0So there's a, you know, you're walking along on the trail and you see worms. And everyone stops and you explore worms. And maybe you have tools on hand to help you explore worms more like magnifying glasses or you know you might create a little terrarium for one and carry it around with you for the day. Or maybe you sit still and observe it. There's a bunch of different tools. So that's Immergent Curriculum. You allow whatever come up to be the curriculum."", 'KATY: To immerge.', 'SARAH S: \xa0And then we use a method, passed down from ', "", called Coyote Mentoring. And it's a way of - you can speak to this please too ..."", 'SARAH G: \xa0Sure.', 'SARAH S: \xa0It\'s a way of using immergent curriculum as well as a planned curriculum to really deepen nature connections. So to get you to become really engaged and understand and feel like you belong. And understand that there\'s a relationship between you and the worm that you find. It\'s not just about, ""oh pretty worm. Let\'s put it in a box and have ownership over it.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH S: And my understanding of Coyote Mentoring and Nature Connection through ', '\xa0model, it\'s more about ""oh this worm is a being and we can respect it for its own life."" \xa0Which might only last a few months long or two days depending on if the robin comes. And we can see a reciprocal relationship. And so that is the kind of the heart of what I consider to be deep nature connection. And so Coyote Mentoring is one method. \xa0There are many many. And there are tons of ways to do that. Immergent curriculum is one. Structured curriculum is another. There\'s tons of ways to do it. Coyote Mentoring is a way to synthesize kind of a structured format with immergent curriculum so that you can really deepen the experience.', ""SARAH G: \xa0I agree. I would say that the coyote is the trickster, right? It's like the kids don't even know they're learning. They're so engaged in wonder and curiosity about what you are finding. And you have all these tools you can pull out to engage them in that worm. And they don't even know half the time that they're learning something. \xa0And I think that's one of the most wonderful beautiful things. They're just so engaged and curious in the state of awe and wonder."", 'KATY: Interesting to that. I interviewed my kids about nature school and one of, I think a lot of parents, you know, ""What did you do today?"" \xa0When you pick them up from school and it\'s always nothing. But my son went on to explain that he\'s actually learning less now. Like his perception is he used to learn more. \xa0And I think it\'s because there was maybe more of one type of curriculum and as he\'s been in the program longer, his perception is he\'s learning less because all he\'s doing all day long is playing and just being. But he\'ll constantly be rattling off all these things what I would consider to be facts or things that he\'s picked up or understandings that he has. But his perception is, he\'s not learning. Because he associates learning with sitting down to memorize or be tested. \xa0You know what I mean? And I was like, ""Yeah. Right on."" Ok, so I\'m just trying to think of more clarification. So it\'s... terms...', ""SARAH S: You know what I think is important is, these terms are not as important if you're not going to go out and start your program from scratch. If you are going to go start your program from scratch, all you have to do is put these, let them be a touchstone once and you will find everything you need along the way. In the show notes we're gonna link to a bunch ..."", 'KATY: So many resources.', ""SARAH S: So there will be - we're putting on there some of the regional national players in the United States. I apologize for international people. I don't have as much knowledge about the resources out there internationally. but there are some. There are definitely quite a few. But I think we don't have to get too worried about it. We will be talking about them a ton. But I think the important things is just like any model of idea, there are a lot of variations. A lot of shades of anything. So there are different ways to educate in nature. Some education models in nature schools are very skills based and some are more what we call soft skills. Really delving into the connection side or the "", 'SARAH G: Natural history.', ""SARAH S: Exactly. So there can be so many different formats. I remember hearing one of your podcasts where you talked about nature school with Dani, and I think even between the two of you there was the experience of multiple nature schools. \xa0And so they're very different. And they're each evolving as well. "", 'KATY: Right.', ""SARAH S: Depending on the teachers, the skillset, the history, the culture, the resources available, the training you're including. So I think when we're talking about Nature schools, \xa0what we have to understand is, you can not paint them with one brush stroke."", 'KATY: Right.', ""SARAH S: \xa0They come in various palates. And if it works for you awesome. And if not, you don't need a nature school to connect with nature because it's everywhere."", 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH S: What we want to happen, actually, is to help ourselves figure out how to turn on that belief that we are a part of nature all the time. Everywhere.', ""KATY: Well and I think, too, the word nature that's sometimes confused with wilderness, you know, right? So I try to use the word green space. Because you can find a green space on a roof in Portland."", ""SARAH S: You can find nature in the McDonald's parking lot."", 'KATY: Exactly. So I think some people listening to this will be thinking of starting something but probably a much larger percentage is like, ""I want this for people that I know."" And then there\'s maybe even a broader group of I don\'t have anyone to put into this but I\'m gonna put my energy towards the idea that yes, this is something that the world can benefit from. And maybe applying it to community gardens or anything else. So the term nature shouldn\'t be scary. It\'s not necessarily something that you can transpose with bushcraft or survival skills. We are simply talking about a space, whether it\'s a physical space or a psychological space for considering the idea that you are nature. We are nature. Which might be the first step.', 'SARAH S: And we feel better when we think when we understand that.', 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH S: I think that\'s where gratitude can come in so powerfully. When you can remember that actually you wake up every day and there\'s water somewhere near you and you have access to it. And there are resources available to you like food, and connection and all of these things are made available because the earth is spinning with consistency for millions of years depending on your belief system. And nature is already, you know, almost when start to think about the magnitude of the earth and the systems and the biology and all of it, you almost kind of get ... you almost can allow yourself to be like, ""Woah, that\'s crazy. This has been going on for our whole lives and I keep forgetting because I live in the middle of the city. And I walk along the city streets and I take a bus. And I forget that I\'m actually a part of the rotating earth system."" \xa0It\'s so nature.', 'KATY: I know. I find it relaxing. I\'m like, ""Oh, this is going on. And this is here. And I\'m just an ant and it\'s fine. And guess what? I\'m part of this beautiful thing.."" \xa0Ok, so let\'s talk a little bit about ', "" which is, I would call more an organization than a school because it embodies or includes many different programs. So there were nature schools that we were talking about but then there's also these smaller commitments, smaller time frame programs like adventure club. So if you were to quickly break down, maybe the arms, the limbs of "", ' what would they be?', ""SARAH G: \xa0Right. So we do an early childhood education program which is our nature pre-school or forest kindergarten program and we call that Owl's Hollow Early Learning. And we meet the needs of 3-6-year-olds right now. \xa0\xa0And then after that, we found that some of our kids wanted to stay with us and they weren't ready to leave and so we started introducing homeschool enrichment classes we're calling them. And those are for, we have a kindergarten-aged class and then a first through third grade age class. And those are just to deepen and enhance the skills and to enrich whatever you're doing at home with your homeschooling. Some kids we've even had them come from one day at public school. \xa0They take the day off public school and they spend the day outside with us. And that is really neat. And then what Katy was talking about is Adventure Club which is our family playgroup drop-in program. And parents come with their kids. It's happening this morning for the first time this season. I'm really excited to hear how it goes. And they stop in. We meet in front of our local Audubon center and then we go. We put on our creature powers. We go for a hike. We have a snack. We tell a story. And parents and their kids are with a trained naturalist and mentor who can give them the tools they need to spend time outside with their kids if that's something that's not comfortable or is comfortable and they just want a community of people to do it with them. \xa0Would you add any other arms to our..."", 'SARAH S: And then we do some camps.', 'SARAH G: Yeah.', ""SARAH S: And this year we're trying to focus on having camps that run a little bit more accessible to public school kids so that when they have like a holiday from school then their parents can have some nature school childcare options. Or just an opportunity for them who might not be able to come to our enrichment programs all year can come at small points throughout the year as well as during the summer. So we do camps as well."", ""KATY: So let's talk about a typical day. I mean I'm laughing at the word typical but let's say a typical day of forest kindergarten. What does that look like?"", 'SARAH S: \xa0So they arrive and we have a curriculum mapped out and as one of our teachers said and I love this line: \xa0""There\'s what you plan and there\'s what is."" And so they arrive, there\'s a first half an hour. We call it inspiration time. So there\'s an activity out. There\'s a game that we\'re thinking about running. And then there\'s also free play and almost anything else you want to do. So for example, this week we\'re learning about the letter p so we brought in plants. So then we dissected plants and they\'re laying out with roots and there\'s mud on them and maybe we are pulling a bunch of leaves. And I had a bunch of beans that needed to be shucked and they were shucking the beans and sorting them. And maybe they quickly tire of that because they\'re preschoolers and so then they want to take the leaves and they want to put them on as a hat and run around and play a different game. \xa0And they make that up. So that\'s allowed too. That\'s part of the nature immersion and fostering their imagination. And then we\'ll have a game so we\'re playing a different game. So that goes on for about a half an hour. Then we have a circle, we meet. We make agreements. That\'s how we do a lot of our safety in our school is by creating agreements with the children instead of creating rules. And then we\'ll discuss whatever we need to as a community. Maybe some of the children want to share something. And then we will go out on a hike and we\'ll hike anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on how far they, depending on the time of year. Depending on how much they need to move to stay warm and comfortable. Their age range. How experienced they are hiking. Where we are in the school year. \xa0Beginning of the school year we only hike a little bit because we have children who are getting used to carrying their own backpack and hiking in a group. And that might be scary. Or challenging. And then at the end of the year you can go so far because they\'re just ready. They know how. Also their parents know how to pack their bag a little bit more efficiently maybe. And so we hike and we often do natural history studies along the way. We saw a newt and so we\'re talking about a newt. And we observe the newt. And we might pull up some tools to explore. We might just sit there and observe or maybe we\'re not interested so we move right past the newt. You know? And then we go to a place and then we have a snack or a substantial snack. It\'s a lunch pretty much. And we have lunch and we talk and again we share gratitude before we do that. And also at our circle in the morning we have a song that we sing that is about gratitude and kind of saying hello to everything. So then we practice gratitude. We have a snack. There\'s also a lot of opportunity to discuss things as a community. Make observations. The kids love, ""Whoever has apples raise your hand."" \xa0\xa0You know they love this kind of exploring together. And then we have what we call wonder time. So that lasts for about an hour and a half. And so we have stations out. And then again, free time and nature immersion is what we\'re doing. So we have fine motor, gross motor activities out. We have maybe a writing activity out. We might have a science activity out. And these things are all extremely efficient because our teachers carry everything in our backpacks. So one of our gross motor that we\'ve been doing for months now because they\'re just enamored with it is mud kitchen. So it\'s just a bag with stackable aluminum containers and maybe a couple of dinosaurs in there. And we just put it out. And then they just, they dig, or they find grass. And they make a bath for the dinosaurs or whatever it is. All they need is just a tiny manipulative to get them totally immersed. And then maybe we just have some beads out with some cord and they can string beads on cord for a fine motor skill and then maybe we have some papers out that are a plant and they get to paint on it and learn about the different pieces of plant. So everything is very efficient. It fits into our bags. We bring some books with us. And then we\'re just helping them engage in nature for an hour and a half. Doing what they want as they\'re called to do it. And then deepening the learning so you know, this is where the coyote mentoring is really valuable. So they want to play with the dinosaurs. And the dinosaur might be trying to kill the plants because they\'re just young and they\'re exploring and they\'re trying to root up this plant. Well that\'s an opportunity for us to talk to the dinosaur and tell the dinosaur that these plants are what dinosaurs eat and what are these pieces that you\'re pulling apart. \xa0Oh these are the roots. So it\'s really engaging with a lot of questions and a lot of curiosity and through that we\'re able to deepen their learning more and more and give each child an individualized learning experience. So if one child really wants to - we\'ve had this before - only learn about planes, because they love planes. So we\'re not gonna try to say, ""Well you need to learn the parts of the root, I mean the parts of the plant."" Instead we say, ""Oh well we need some leaves so we can make an airplane."" And then, so through their own passion, their child passions, we\'re able to access what it is that we want to try to expose them to. And get them excited about it. Now they\'re learning about leaves and stems and roots of a plant because now we\'re making - we need the roots to tie the sticks together, the stems together so that we can make an airplane. So there\'s an hour and a half of wonder time and we\'re doing this kind of ... it\'s like a tension back and forth between following them and then kind of invisibly leading them. And then after that we hike back. Oh we have forest music. So we\'ll sing some songs, make some music with whatever nature objects that we can find - rattle some stones in your hand or hit some sticks together. And then we\'ll return hike. And then we have a story collecting at the end of the day where everyone gets to talk about their experience for the day. Which is really an important part of gathering in nature together - is to collect the stories. Because that\'s where a lot of the children will learn - process their learning. Reinforce their learning and also re-engage with the passion and the wonder that they have. And then we have pickup.', ""KATY: Is that the best part of the day? \xa0It's the most relaxing."", ""SARAH S: \xa0Sometimes it's actually the most chaotic."", 'KATY: Well you have a bunch of adults ruining your flow.', ""SARAH S: Everybody's in, yeah."", ""KATY: So you guys are moving a lot clearly, as instructors. This is a podcast where we are thinking about movement and the ways that humans move. So Sarah G you were trying to think of some of the movements that... I mean there's probably not that many movements that the kids do that you don't do at least in some way. At least the duration of them. \xa0So what are they?"", ""SARAH G: \xa0I was brainstorming. We walk on uneven surfaces. \xa0We're all carrying our backpacks. Our heavy loads. Sarah was talking about those buckets. Sometimes they fill them up with mud and water and they are like these heavy things that they're carrying round with them. They're hiking on the trails. They're climbing trees. They're navigating obstacles. A lot of time we're going through big tall brush and that's challenge for a lot of kids."", 'SARAH S: \xa0Andover and under logs. With a backpack too.', 'SARAH G: Your backpack is definitely... the other day we were playing a game on the trail and you run off and hide in the bushes. And there\'s just backpacks littered on the trail because they\'re like, ""We can\'t take these into the bushes.', ""KATY: I'm not gonna lose hungry bear because of this backpack."", 'SARAH S: Exactly.', 'SARAH G: \xa0Let\'s see, what else do they have. Navigating their layers of clothing in the winter. \xa0I was thinking about temperature regulation. The other day it was sunny and beautiful and they all took off all their layers and I looked at Sarah and said, ""They\'re gonna have to put all those back on.', ""KATY: That's right."", 'SARAH G: And then digging. Construction projects. Balancing on logs. It was snowy a few weeks ago and they were climbing up this log that was on an angle. And ti was really slippery. And they were managing and balancing and helping each other. \xa0So those are some of the movements that came to my mind right away that we do.', 'SARAH S: And lots of up and down. Up and down. Up and down.', 'SARAH G: Yes.', ""SARAH S: That's what I notice all day long."", 'SARAH G: Yes.', ""SARAH S: Even in our office which you all will be happy to know is largely furniture free. So I'm always noticing down on the computer, I sit at the desk and then I go walk across the room to go get the office supplies. And walk across the other side of the room to go get ... so it's like that in nature school. Up and down, up and down."", 'KATY: So I can hear people\'s minds like tick tick tick listening to this. And we get a lot of emails when I put out a question about what do you want to know about nature school and there was a lot of people who were like ... they are looking themselves for a connection to nature. I think so much of this came up around children with Richard Louv\'s book: A Child in Nature. \xa0This idea of Vitamin nature being so important for kids. But it\'s important for all human beings. For all earthlings.\xa0 And there were a lot of grown-ups who were interested in changing their path to lead some... seeing this is a hole in their community. And they have a passion for it and desire. But they themselves are not ""woodsy"". So I wanted to.', 'SARAH S: Neither am I!', ""KATY: Right right. So I wanted to break down the idea that you two, while you are excellent teachers and leaders of your nature program, you're not McDodge coming fresh from the woods. \xa0You don't - you're not fairies. You wear shoes. You have cars."", ""SARAH S: I'm not wearing a leopard print skirt that I made myself."", ""SARAH S: Yes. I'm excellent when there's dry weather. Hot outside."", 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH S: My wood is warm and chopped and I have all the tools like a hatchet and a knife and a lighter.', 'SARAH G: Firestarter.', 'SARAH S: And newspaper.', 'KATY: And massage!', 'SARAH S: Exactly. \xa0No children around. \xa0So I, yes, I can appreciate that it is intimidating and that we can have these ideas that you have to embody a certain skill before you can a) either go out and practice it or even do it safely. I think that\'s a big thing for people is, ""I want to do this but I don\'t know where the safety margins are."" \xa0So that can be very intimidating. And also, who am I to go out and try this thing. People are gonna see I\'m a poser. If you\'ve ever had those thoughts, rest assured other people have had those thoughts too. Including myself. So, I heard, and I did read the questions on one of your ', ', people saying ""How do I start this? Where do I? \xa0What are my first steps?"" So here are some steps that will be helpful. First, you want to really enjoy your connection with nature whether it\'s a tiny, tiny little seed that you\'re planting right now and just going outside and noticing where the trees are. How many trees are on your block? Walk it once a week. You probably are already walking some amount of the time if you are listening to this podcast. \xa0So notice where the trees are. Notice where the nature is that you aren\'t already noticing. When you\'re driving in your car, just start to notice, are their birds on the wires? Are their birds on the side of the road, you know? This might be weird but are there dead animal carcasses on the side of the road. A lot of us aren\'t even registering that. So the first thing is to just notice. If that is where you are, just start to notice. If you are already a naturalist, you\'re used to noticing. \xa0If you want to deepen your nature connection, a program that I really found valuable through ', "" is the Kamana Naturalist Training course. And it's a self-led naturalist training course and they teach you how to notice. And they teach you how to begin to learn how to be safe out in the woods."", ""KATY: And it's all online right?"", 'SARAH S: \xa0It is a book that you send away for and you do it. And then you can send it away and you get a certificate. And I found it really valuable. What it does it it start to tune you into your senses. It start to turn on in you the belief that ...or that knowing that I am part of nature. Nature is everywhere. Even if I live in a city. They even give you tips for ""if you live in a city you can still find nature."" \xa0I live in the country.It\'s very quiet. I really appreciate quiet. I went to the city for a conference over the summer and I was staying in a hostel right in the international district. So it was very loud, extremely loud. Very busy. I\'m staying in this little tiny room. The only way out of the building is through the fire escape or the elevator thing. And it was kind of intense for me. And also, it\'s the summer so it\'s a nice place to hang out and be quiet. So I sat on the fire escape and I was doing my sit spot time, essentially, you know. Just looking at the tops of the trees and the doves and the pigeons that were flying around over the buildings and watching the sky. And it\'s loud. And there\'s people everywhere. But there was still so much nature to be had. In the middle of the city. In the middle of this crowded place where there\'s a lot of people who are hurting and there\'s a lot of homeless and drugs and things like that. \xa0And you can see sometimes, sometimes we have to break out of our box of what nature is to be able to access it. So noticing is one thing. If you want to get in to really practicing of noticing, Kamana is a good resource. Or any kind of place where you can go and start to learn about the birds. Birds are an excellent resource in to learning about nature because they speak a lot. And they, they\'re everywhere. Even in the city. And there is so much to learn from them. So going to a nature center and taking a birding class or looking online about birds. So there\'s so many resources there. Then if you want to take it a step further and you want to start something, whether you\'re a homeschool parent and you want to bring more nature connection into your child\'s life, whether you are taking care of elders or somebody you want to help them connect with nature, or you want to start a program because you just think this is a need in your community or it\'s a calling for you, basically you get comfortable with your relationship with nature, get very very curious about everything you\'re seeing all the time. There\'s a worm. Where\'s it going? Why is it doing that? \xa0Is this the time for worms? Just asking questions constantly. And then just start somewhere. You know, for me, I started adventure club 6 years ago, or 7 years ago now because I wanted to start a nature school and I didn\'t know how. So I just started this little walk in playgroup and it\'s really shifted formats over the years to figure out what would work for me. What would work for our community. What did people want to attend. I spent a lot of time showing up and nobody was coming. So it was really a slog in some ways, but it was also such a joy in other ways because I\'d bring my kids. And we would play. And many years later that program is still going. So start something and there\'s resources out there. The Hike-it baby is a place where families get together and they hike together. There\'s Tinker Garden. There\'s different places out there where people group together and meet and do that kind of thing, play with young children outside. Or start something. Just start a playgroup or a meetup or something on Facebook or social media or something like that. So you could just start. On the show link, on the bio, is that what it\'s called, the notes.', 'KATY: \xa0Show notes.', ""SARAH S: Show notes, thanks, we listed some regional players that we know in the United States. So if you're interested in really getting something started more significantly, go check out the Natural Start Alliance, the Children in Nature network, some of these regional players. Eastern region of forest and nature schools. "", "" on the west coast, there's the "", '. The ', '. So these are the big players that I know of in the United States of places that support nature schools regionally and train nature schools regionally. ', ' and ', "" also train teachers. So those are all in the show notes. Those are just names to put in the back of your head if you're interested in starting something more significantly."", 'SARAH G: I would just add that I like to remember that I\'m not the expert. And I don\'t need to be the expert. \xa0One of my favorite things to say to the kids is, ""I don\'t know the answer to that. That is a really good question. Let\'s look it up together."" \xa0Because then you\'re teaching them the skills to be able to find the answers to their questions. They\'re critically thinking. They\'re engaged in science using a field guide if that\'s the type of question that they\'re asking. And you get to find out the answer together and you get to engage in being curious together. You\'re not the expert and you don\'t need to be the expert. You can find the answers with them.', ""KATY: You're going to school too. You're going to school."", 'SARAH G: Yeah.', 'SARAH S: And one of the last pieces to that too is get curious and allow yourself wonder.', 'SARAH G: Mm-hmm', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'SARAH S: You know, that is like, ""Woah. The flower is blooming. Can I pause and be in wonder with that?"" That is such a touchstone for, I think, nature education.', 'KATY: I feel like we\'ve lost a lot of wonder because of the magic Google box that we all have in our hand. Anytime you want to know anything you just are so quick to look it up to be told what it is. \xa0There\'s no speculation. There\'s no time of ""Maybe it\'s this or that."" So it\'s been fun, I\'ve written before about sometimes putting away guides or digital look up pieces when you\'re out there just to have the phase of ""what is it? "" And that goes for nature and also for movies and songs from the 90s that you can\'t recall. \xa0Just let yourself wonder. Let yourself wonder about what the lyrics were and who sang it and what movie it was from. Because I feel like my brain is losing its ability to search and create because all of the answers are given to by someone else.', 'SARAH S: And that\'s actually a part of the - that\'s exactly the heart of the type of teaching we do. Because when a child says, ""What kind of tree is that?"" And you say, ""Oh, that\'s a cedar tree."" They stop being curious. They think they have the answer and that\'s the end of it. But we don\'t know a million things about that cedar tree. We might know a lot about cedar trees but we don\'t know what that cedar tree is doing.', 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH S: In that moment. Is it drinking more water now than it was in the summer? Is it drinking less? How much water is it giving off? \xa0How much, is it, how many micro causal connections does it have to all the trees around it? What kinds of roots does it have and can we use those for anything? \xa0There\'s a million questions to ask. And when we start to realize how little we know, we can be not only in the sense of ""I wonder"" but in awe.', 'KATY: Right.', ""SARAH S: That sense of wonder as well. \xa0And so there is so much that's gained by being curious and also knowing that we don't have the answers. We don't have to have the answers. That gigantic earth ball is still holding us with all the things going on."", 'KATY: I\'m on the bus and on the ball at the same time. Well and to that point too, I\'m, and our personal family, we\'re really trying to watch classification systems like being from a really traditional biological mindset, really trying to go well, ""some people would call that a cedar. But even if you\'re ... but it isn\'t\' \'a cedar\', that\'s a name for it."" Here\'s five names for it. \xa0I feel that that\'s really important in these times where we\'re really trying to understand inclusivity and diversity. To recognize different but equal perspectives on things. You could consider it part of social science. I consider it a part of really great biological science is to recognize the various classification systems. Which leads me to another question. Which is like what are some considerations around accessibility and inclusivity, diversity with nature education? Are there hurdles that you are jumping or thinking about? \xa0What can you weigh in on that?', 'SARAH G: The Natural Start Alliance just did a national survey of nature preschools in the United States and they found that we are mostly serving white kids and most of those kids can access nature in some way other than nature school. Nature school does not need to be their primary avenue to access being outside. \xa0And so at our organization, we started talking a lot about what barriers we can reduce in order to be more inclusive of all kinds of people and kids who want to do our programs.', ""SARAH S: \xa0And it is a big conversation in the movement - in the nature school movement. The Natural Start Alliance did a national conference in the summer in August and the topic was Inclusivity, Diversity, and equity. And they did a really nice job of bringing in various perspectives and helping, I'll speak for myself, helping me understand the different types of diversity and the different types of inclusivity and some of the barriers. A lot of the times you create a barrier because you don't know. You create a structure that works for you but you don't realize that it doesn't work for other people so you're inadvertently creating a barrier for some people. So understanding that that is happening and being open to the idea of seeing it from other perspectives is really valuable. \xa0So it is part of the conversation. RIght now we are working with the Department of Early learning in Washington state on a pilot program to license outdoor preschools and nature preschools. And there is a big conversation and some of the team, some of the other nature schools are really doing an awesome job of continuing to advocate for diversity and inclusivity. Recognizing that if we make these considerations or set up this structure that we are really limiting the ability of some people of economic means or of social structures or culture and heritage and ethnicity...they're not going to find it as accessible. So how do we lower those barriers? And how do we constantly take them into consideration? It's a challenge for us. Extremely challenging. We have to, of our primary concern of all times is safety. We are operating in public parks, in woods, heavily wooded areas. \xa0In one of our parks literally, there is a cliff, not super close."", ""KATY: It's there."", ""SARAH S: Then there's like roads and people that are out in these public parks. So having a child run away is extremely dangerous. Now, there's all kinds of ways to consider that. And there's all kinds of things that we do to set safety and protective measures. But it's very challenging for us to accept a child who can't stay with the group to a certain degree."", 'KATY: Right.', ""SARAH S: And we have all kinds of ways that we work with the children to make sure that they can. So we don't have to have children that are super excellent at following directions and staying with the group but we do have to have children who are going to not consistently run away from the group either. And so it's challenging because sometimes we'll have a child that isn't ready for that and or if we have a child that has some special needs, maybe we can't accommodate it because we're running at such a lead ratio. There such so many things to consider. So it is a question we're asking ourselves. It is something we're working towards."", ""KATY: There's a couple things that that brought up for me. For one, I followed that conference. It had an excellent twitter feed so you can search the hashtag. I'll see if I can find it and put it in the show notes and you can see people quoting takeaways of various presentations as well as if you go back to the line up of who was speaking you can connect with them and their work which is much bigger than the 30 minute presentation that they did. Sometimes there's entire books on - I love that word barriers. Someone has thought a lot about a single barriers. That's what it is. There's an expert in various barriers and that you just have to kind of cultivate an exposure to many different people who have thought deeply about many different aspects and then glean what you can and what you can change right away. The other thing was, and I just put this out if you get my newsletter, schools aren't the only thing going nature. We're starting to see therapists go nature. So there's new occupational therapy that's offering therapy in nature. And so I think sometimes we put it on the school to provide the sole source of nature but one of the ways I think that trying to figure out how to get more nature when the school isn't prepared to handle everyone all of the time is to look for other avenues. Like maybe just as parents adding a little bit more exposure to nature so that we're not just dropping someone at school who has not had previous exposure to nature. But if someone is getting therapy, I've seen speech-language, OT, and PT now in parks with small groups. So it's almost like they're seeing as more as understood about how things work, how therapy works, how movement works and that nature provides all of these - well natural environment for these things to happen, I think that the benefit is not only are they getting therapy, we're also getting exposure to nature. So I don't think it's going to have to be only schools. Eventually, I'll see this Vitamin Nature stuff happening in other elements of our day."", ""SARAH S: That's really cool."", ""KATY: Yeah. It's exciting. It's exciting. Ok, my kids go to your school. I learn a lot from them all the time so I'm constantly being educated. So it's outside of their education that I think is benefiting from the school. What other sort of benefits do you see coming from children who have deepened their relationship or their understanding of nature? Have you seen it trickle into other elements?"", ""SARAH S: You're asking how does it affect people's lives out of school?"", ""KATY: Yeah outside of the child is now getting the thing that they need, you know, like, I have found that yes this is what they need but I'm am being enriched for their enrichment. And the trickle, I guess trickle down or trickle up or out is I'm more motivated to bring more people in the community to it. I want to make it more accessible. So I'm motivated to do that because this is so much more than Vitamin N for a kid, and their brain and their muscles. To me, it's a salve on the planet. On the giant ball I'm swirling around on. So what are the other..."", 'SARAH S: One of the things I think about nature education is it\'s so contextual. So, you know, yes we\'re learning about plants and the letter p, but what we\'re really learning about is how do we create more resiliency in our bodies. How do I stay comfortable when the weather is changing? How do I stay comfortable when I am intimidated by this log that I have to climb over? How do I find comfort or soothe or bring in emotional regulation tools? \xa0There\'s so much learning that\'s happening in nature. Not that that\'s not happening elsewhere as well, but there are so many variables that are outside of your control: the teacher\'s control and the children\'s control. And so there\'s this constant practice of resiliency. As well as, then, critical thinking. Responding. Curiosity as we talked about. Wonder. And awe. All of these things, in my opinion, and my experience, develop a love for learning, create critical thinking, problem-solving, resiliency, emotional... yeah resiliency is the word - the ability to respond creatively to things. \xa0And I think that children take that with them. And so then when they go into - and there\'s a lot of studies out there that talk about that. Not only that but nature itself is soothing to the regulatory system. And so they go outside and it\'s been, I mean anyone who has been - especially if you\'re on the east coast - you\'re inside in the winter and you\'re getting a little stagnant and you\'re like, ""Oh it\'s so nasty out..."" It\'s cold, it\'s wet. Maybe it\'s just to get in your car. Or maybe it\'s to go for a 10-minute walk. Or maybe it\'s a to go for a 40-minute walk, or 2 hours or whatever. And maybe you\'ve had this experience: you go outside and it\'s really uncomfortable. The kids are crying. Everyone\'s cold and what or whatever the experience is. And when you come back in, you always feel better. Almost no matter how bad the experience is outside, as long as you\'re not hypothermic maybe, you feel better coming back inside. So I think that is what nature does to us. It helps us create - go outside of our comfort zones, go to the edge of the comfort zones. Create a little bit more space there and flexibility there. And then when we are fully inside our comfort zone we actually have a lot more tools to play with and we are ready. We\'re honed in. Our nervous system is more in regulation and we can focus more. There\'s so many studies and books and things out there that talk about those kinds of things so in my opinion, children, whether they go to nature school, whether they free play outside, whether it\'s on the playground at school for 30-40 minutes whatever, it\'s always of benefit because they\'re contextualizing their environment and learning all these things. That being said some of the other benefits that we\'ve seen are: empowerment, you know, this resiliency in friendship. We really teach the children to lean into each other and ask for help and things like that. And then those things also trickle into the families from what I\'ve heard. They\'ll say they\'re more enabled as a family to go outside because now their child isn\'t as resistant. Or ""We like to hike and now our child can actually hike with us."" Or we do have some families that say ""we want to get into nature but we don\'t know how. Now we feel like we\'re around a community that can help us like that so our child is more comfortable so we\'re learning to be more comfortable."" So there\'s a lot of trickles. Trickles out.', 'SARAH G: That is a good question. Do you have your answer?', ""SARAH S: My top three. \xa0It's a trifecta of awesomeness. I love singing the nature songs outside. They bring me a lot of joy. So I personally sing a lot on nature school. Sing a lot of these earth wisdom songs as we call them - or I call them. And looking up at the trees and seeing the wind passing and seeing \xa0- just looking up and seeing nature. We were at this overlook, it's like a trail and there's a little hill that goes down and paths and you can see the mountains in the distance and then there's a meadow right there and sitting in the sun. And it's just like, playing with the children, rocks, dinosaurs, buckets and then you look up and there's mountains or you look up and there are the trees swaying. So that is my second favorite thing. And then laughing with the children - I just love it. It's such a joy. So those are my top three. Sorry.."", 'SARAH G: I would say that I get my daily dose of nature and to be outside with amazing little humans. And the sense of community both with the families, with the staff, and with the kids. I know them so well and I get to be with them and see them at their best and their worst and their challenges and their successes and I think that that is probably one of the most rewarding things.', 'KATY: I love that you say that it\'s a community with the kids because we had a stressful even at our house and Finn came up and said, ""Try this breathing technique. Sarah\'s husband does it all the time and it calms him down."" He\'s just as interested in what your lives and you and I love that that\'s what you brought home from that. \xa0It wasn\'t a curriculum thing but it\'s a relaxing breathing technique. Ok. And so, the other question was, I have to laugh because ... and I have this recorded because I was recording when I was interviewing them. The question from Roan was: What will nature school be like in the future but it was amended by Finn which is, what do you think nature school will be like in the future because you don\'t know.', 'SARAH S: Awesome. \xa0Well - contextualize future. Are we talking 2 years or are we talking?', 'KATY: I think that you can answer however you like.', ""SARAH S: I would like to envision that nature school is accessible to everybody so that it is in public school. It's part of the public school curriculum. It's accessible for free to people and there's so many ways that it is available that it is not even a thing anymore."", ""KATY: Yeah. It's not school and nature school. It's just school. Pick your poison."", ""SARAH S: Yeah. Exactly. And that we are all so in the mindset of that we are nature that we're thinking about, you know, at this point, we're thinking about nurturance and attachment and things like that in how children are raised and I wanted to be at some point part of that conversation. \xa0How are children, we talk now in the United States about read to your child from the youngest age, but we also at some point be, remember take your child outside every day. Let them touch and explore and put things in their mouth or whatever it is at every age too. So I hope that's the future of nature school. That it is nature all the time."", 'SARAH G: All the time.', ""KATY: It's like tooth brushing right? We have had many successful public health messages come out that are based on, hey we have realized that this early is something that decreases the need for things, therapies, down the road. So take care of your teeth, brush every day, make sure you exercise a little bit. That nature will be one of those things which will be more efforts to make sure it's available to everyone. \xa0We'll have to be lockstep with that. Ok, so before we go I get a lot of questions I answer to per podcast. And we have a collective that sponsors them. Each part of the collective sponsors the second question. Today it's MyMayu."", 'SARAH S: Oh great!', ""KATY: MyMayu outdoor boots sponsor this kind of question or tips section that we're about to go down because they are also a sponsor of your nature school."", 'SARAH S: Thank you, Suzanne.', ""KATY: She's so great. \xa0So I get a lot of questions about gear. I'm sure you do too. I remember, Sarah, when you were starting before you launched the big school, you were trying to figure out gear. And gear is so essential. And I like to broaden the idea of gear to be beyond clothing but also the food that people pack with them. Because I think that if you're used to sitting all day, that your nutritional needs, energy needs, ratio needs, would be different than if you're out moving. So that gets lost sometimes. Kids aren't hanging. Like I'm having a hard time taking my own kids out for a hike. And it's like, you might want to check their gear, including what they're being fed because that might be the key. I mean I have figured out the balance of food that can make for a 10-mile hike for little kids. But it's like a chemistry experiment."", 'SARAH S: Does it include a lot of chocolate.', ""KATY: It includes some chocolate. And it actually includes the promise of chocolate. They're not fueled by chocolate, they're fueled by the promise of chocolate on the other side. But anyway, what are some gear tips that you have? General. I mean you guys filmed a ton of amazing videos that hopefully some day will find up on one page of your website so someone can just watch and look at all of them and see all that work that you did. Because it's super helpful. But what is your best gear tip?"", ""SARAH G: \xa0Best gear tip? \xa0I think it's what's comfortable for your child, right? \xa0Sarah and I were actually talking about this the other day. You could spend $40 on a pair of rain pants and they're never gonna wear them."", 'KATY: Right.', 'SARAH G: Because it\'s not comfortable for them. So finding what\'s comfortable for your child. Asking other parents what\'s comfortable. We have a closed family facebook group and a lot of the times new families will come on and will ask ""What does your child wear? What do they like? What\'s comfortable to them?"" \xa0And if it\'s not comfortable to them they\'re not going to wear it, and they\'re not going to keep it on so what\'s the point of sending them to school in them.', ""SARAH S: Although please still send rain gear. Even if your kids aren't gonna wear it. We might still just get on them if they want to ... \xa0I would like to say for MyMayus, one of our families in particular found that putting cornstarch in the boot at the beginning of the day, maybe that came from your family even. I know it circulated around, putting cornstarch in can help the child navigate getting their foot in and out. \xa0So that's been helpful. A lot of parents in our school using MyMayu. "", 'KATY: Which has got Roan yelling every morning, ""Where\'s my flour?"" \xa0I was like, ""What do you mean?"" And then she\'s like, ""my corn starch"". It just slips the boot right out.', 'SARAH S: And then I understand you just pour it out at the end of the day. \xa0So I think that finding the right gear is great. I joke that nature school uniform is pajamas. Because fleece is easy to come by in pajamas. \xa0So you know, layers is key. Being flexible. And I think, you know when you want to talk about gear and having it be bigger than just the clothing you\'re putting on. I think you have to include mindset. Recognizing that when you are going outside, especially if you\'re going outside to go to the edge of your comfort zone, whether that\'s a 30-minute hike with your kids. Which I did for the first time yesterday. I\'d never taken my kids hiking all by myself before. And we got on the trail for about 30 minutes and everyone was melting down and I was like, ""Awesome. We did this. This is great. Let\'s go""', 'KATY: Better than being inside.', 'SARAH S: And also that was the edge of our comfort zone. I learned a lot. Why am I uncomfortable with this. Oh for x, y, z reasons. So you know when you go to the edge of your comfort zone, recognize that you\'re actually learning a lot there. So the mindset is really key. We\'re just going to go out to the point where it\'s no longer fun. Maybe that\'s what you do. Or maybe you just say we\'re just gonna go out for 20 minutes. And then you\'re still having fun at 20 minutes so you stay for another 10. So you don\'t have to make it epic actually. What you want to do is make it attainable so that you have a positive experience. So one time my husband went outside with our children. He got them all bundled up and they literally played in the puddle in the road in front of our house for 20 minutes, got sopping wet, and then he took them back in and he\'s like, ""I think I took longer to get them dressed than I actually was outside with them."" But they came back in and they had that experience of ""oh we feel so much better."" So making it attainable is part of the mindset I would like to encourage as part of the gear. And recognizing there are going to be challenges. \xa0And if you can mitigate those challenges with promises of chocolate, maybe that\'s the right tool. Or recognizing that sometimes you need to experience - we do this at the school - it\'s ok to experience the meltdown, actually.', 'SARAH G: \xa0Yeah.', ""SARAH S: \xa0Sometimes, not every time. You get to choose when you want to do that. But you can experience the meltdown because there's a lot to learn. Oh this is why we put on that extra coat. This is why we x, y, z. You know later when you're calm and comfortable again then you can talk about and learn from. So, you know, those are part of the gear options too is the mindset. I think food is a bit one."", 'SARAH G"" \xa0Yeah.', 'SARAH S: One of the parents taught me recently that they pack four proteins.', 'SARAH G: \xa0Yes.', 'KATY: Protein is a game changer.', ""SARAH S: It's a game changer."", ""KATY; It's a game changer"", 'SARAH S: And if that means that you pack some foods that you buy special for nature school day or special for the hike or whatever it is. So having a lot of protein. I would say also having a decent amount of carbs.', ""SARAH G: Or a warm drink in the winter. The kids who have a warm drink and who are warming on the inside there's such a difference in how much they can handle for being cold if they have a warm drink with them."", 'KATY: Very comforting.', ""SARAH S: Another thing is fear. Recognizing that we are modern people and we probably have a lot of fear. Conscious or subconscious. \xa0And recognizing where you're taking your fear along with you. So it doesn't mean that it has to inhibit you. Maybe you just go to the edge of that. So, for example, I took my kids hiking and I had some fears. So I went to where I felt like I could still be safe and comfortable. Explore the edge of what I felt comfortable with but not go outside where I felt safe, you know. I stayed where I felt safe. So we went hiking for a half an hour and I realized there are no more people on the trail and I'm an hour up a mountain with no cell service and I have three kids. I'm like, I'm not feeling safe anymore."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""SARAH S: We were at the edge of our comfort level for other reasons before that but now I'm not feeling safe so I'm gonna honor that and move back to where I feel safe. So recognizing that I've seen some discussions on Facebook and different forums and things like that about how people feel around being safe outside with their children. And safety is a huge one. Especially when you're trying to role model for your children. So if you feel uncomfortable touching bugs or being out on a trail, you can subconsciously model that for them. Which is ok. Because it's better than not going at all maybe. \xa0But you just have to recognize where you have your fear and just maybe honor it and also when you can notice it and recognize that it's at play here. Because I think that fear is another piece of the ..."", 'KATY: Gear.', ""SARAH S: This is the gear that we're taking with us. So, that might not be the heart of the question."", ""KATY: Well I think it's actually better than the heart of the question because it recognizes that you're showing - you're showing up"", 'SARAH G: Yes.', ""KATY: With things. And you can move things around or choose things or be aware of different things and how those things that you're bringing are affecting your experience."", ""SARAH S: Especially if your fear is that your children will get too cold and then they're gonna have a meltdown and it'll be uncomfortable. \xa0Then you notice, I feel fear about this and then I bring extra clothes even if that's not what they're gonna wear. Or we plan a shorter outing or we make sure that we can be successful so that we want to try it again later."", 'KATY: Well that was amazing. Thank you, both. Where can people find more about ', "" and see pictures of what's going on daily?"", 'SARAH G: So our website is ', '. And you can find us on ', ' and ', ' as Olympic Nature Experience.', ""KATY: All right. Go follow them. It's inspiring. And it's just the little videos that you post are great ideas for someone who is thinking - you don't have to start a nature school but you can do almost everything that's on there in your backyard. you can do it in a park. I used to do nature babysitting. Where I would say I'm going to this park and I'm going to do this one-mile loop. I feel ok with five toddlers, or whatever, and that would be my contribution. So there's a lot of ways to do it."", 'SARAH S: \xa0Absolutely.', 'KATY: All right. Anything else that you want to leave the peoples with?', ""SARAH S: Thank you so much for this time and I would just like to encourage, you know, you to enjoy a little bit of nature today.

He’s fed thousands of in-need people on his walks and has used ultramarathons to fundraise tens of thousands of dollars for community causes; from Toronto all the way to Tokyo. \xa0If you've read my book "", "", Ben's name and story will be familiar to you. \xa0He wrote the forward. Ben Pobjoy, welcome to Move Your DNA."", 'BEN: Thank you so much for having me.', 'KATY: \xa0As many listening know, I work on clarifying definitions around movement. One, for better science. And two for better application. If exercise/sports/athletics are the only entry points into movement this makes it very challenging for all humans to see how movement fits into life from both a biological and a practical standpoint. So I personally recognize the ""exercise as movement"" phenomenon. Personally, after having my first child and still having this full workload. And I was like, ""Oh, I\'m going to have to choose between mothering time, my creative production, work time, and exercise time."" \xa0And I found that I didn\'t want to. Because I had a strong desire for challenging movement. Like hours of it a day. That desire had not gone away but now I was in this new scenario where I now had kind of an equally strong desire to be with this tiny human and also to still do which just defined me for a long period of time. And I couldn\'t reconcile it and it made no sense to me why I was having to choose. Which sent me back to researching cross-cultural data and trying to understand why I had to make a choice. Which led, ultimately to the content you can now read in ', ' and ', '. \xa0So, in short, that exercise is one type of movement - a new type of human beings was my takeaway. \xa0There was more to the science of movement story than a daily bout of exercise. So I had the pleasure of hanging out with you, Ben, at the book release party for ', ' and you shared the story of how you had a different but yet similar jolt of recognition about how you had perceived movement as a youth. So could we start by you sharing some of those insights?', ""KATY: Let's get physical!"", ""BEN: Let's get physical. So I always found it kind of off-putting. And I have quite cultural parents who always took us to museums and galleries. So definitely being more into being a book nerd as a kid and that kind of, you know, led to being in my teens and being into music and getting into punk. And what I found in that community, there was always kind of this antagonism between the punks and the jocks. Which to me is part of a larger kind of divisiveness between brain and brawn. And I think, in a lot of ways it relates to the division of labor. Right? Specifically to capital itself. That the more you have the less you tend to physically do and the more you kind of like minimize people who work physically. So I've always thought about it in these two silos of like brain and brawn and they always seem to be at opposing ends of the spectrum. And then I realized the third pillar missing is balance and connecting the two. So I kind of arrived to that in my own way after being, I guess, a bit of a hater for a while."", 'KATY: You started to add more movement as you wrote in Movement Matters, about how you started to introduce more movement into your life simply by walking to and from work. So why did you start there?', ""BEN: \xa0I started with walking because a few years ago I was radically out of shape. And I found that one thing that I kind of come into my own is, is essential learning physical literacy and learning about my body and learning about what it can and can't do and even moving beyond what I think it cannot do. And at the time I was so radically out of shape that I just arrived at walking because it was the easiest, lightest thing on my body. And I found I could actually integrate it in my life in a way that was seamless and function, versus group exercise classes which were embarrassing for me as well as a detour from a busy life. So, I found that the sweet spot for me was utilizing movement in a way that had function to enhance or enrich my life verse this perception that it was detracting from it or an inconvenience or something I had to schedule."", ""BEN: Yeah. I think a bit of both. I think that when you are out of shape and you are heavy and you don't fit conventional standards of beauty, you feel exposure and vulnerability walking into any gym. Especially if your skills aren't at the level as other people at the gym where there's technical equipment. Where you might not have the know how-how to use. There's no camouflage. So I don't find that those environments are fundamentally inviting to people who want to learn because they're technical. \xa0They're literally surrounded by mirrors. It's just, for me personally, it wasn't an inviting place at the time."", ""BEN: Hell no. \xa0Even to this day I've never gone back and told him. So for me, I just liked that it was casual as opposed to this big application. And it was seamless."", 'BEN: \xa0\xa0Exactly. And even to this day, I don\'t like the word ""exercise."" \xa0It speaks to programs to me. ', 'BEN: There\'s a conceptual cast around what it is and what it isn\'t. And to me, I principally don\'t like the word ""exercise"". I like the word ""movement."" And because I think it\'s just tied to however you want to express that whether it\'s dance, whether it\'s walking with, you know, various loads. Walking your groceries home. IT can be whatever you want it to be.', 'BEN: As opposed to some projected notion of what exercise is or has to be.', ""BEN: I just found that I enjoyed being outside. As someone who spends his days in front of computers or clutching smartphones on calls and reviewing emails, just being outside and being present, I found was an unbelievably amazing benefit of just being outside walking. Not only just inhaling fresh air but being kind of a first-hand witness to the world as opposed to receiving broadcasts of it through social media feeds. I just felt so much more present out in the world and saw so much magic out there; really funny things that you don't notice blazing by in a taxi cab or inside in a gym. So it was just very humanistic to me in its appeal."", ""BEN: \xa0Well there is a lot that I saw but equally a lot that I felt. So obviously I made a bit of a new year's resolution to get fit and it became a big initiative in my life that I started to prioritize every day. And so I was aware very early on that a lot of my time is being put into me and my improvement. And while that's great on a personal level, what I found was I was doing that often outdoors on walks whether it was before work or after work, I live downtown. I work in an area where there's a big mental health building. \xa0And you know, I just started to pass the same people on the streets and you know, it kind of - there was this reckoning moment where I realized I was focusing so much on my improvement walking by so many other people that I just couldn't reconcile it. And so I thought one thing I can do is kind of integrate my - or reform my physical movement to have more social movement and try and do a bit of good in the community."", '\n', ""BEN: \xa0That's a... it's a really tough one to answer because..."", ""BEN: Yeah, I guess the way I thought about is that as the weight came off my body - you know I ended up losing 100 pounds going from someone who was completely out of shape to someone who has a pretty decent level of fitness now. \xa0As that weight came off, I would walk more and I would see more. So when you see more and you're receptive to what you're seeing and it leaves an imprint on you, you inherently want to do more so even though, I think looking in, people can see how I've kind of retooled my physical movement to do social work, to me it's just like, its still never feels enough. Because of, quite honestly, a lot of the suffering that I see out there. So that's why I'm constantly challenging myself to re-imagine how I can make a bigger impact and do more. So that's why, kind of, the journey of how I've used movement to unlock social movement has kind of grown larger and deeper. \xa0Effectively trying to change more."", 'BEN: \xa0Yeah. Yeah. \xa0I think in athletic terms, people talk about personal best and trying to - is it run further, achieve a faster pace, swim more lengths, or what not. \xa0So for me, my personal best is simply how can I be a better person.', ""BEN: Yeah. I think my ability to go far, I think is pretty remarkable and what I've been able to achieve. So my feet have gone through a journey on their own from being these supple cherub feet that never really been worked out. Then I got into walking where, you know, they were so raw. And they went through this phase of them becoming so calloused they probably looked like cavemen feet. And now they've kind of evolved to be regular looking feet with this, I don't know, they're like superhero feet now. \xa0Look normal but still, I'm out there tracking more than ever. So, I have seen these weird almost evolutionary changes in my body. And even just how it feels to move. I remember when I'd go before where walking for an hour felt a long time. And now I regularly go and just do continuous marathons which can take 6 hours. And just through focusing on breathing I can get lost and hours sail by. So yeah it's been fascinating to just experience how different movement can feel."", 'BEN: So it\'s kind of been a few years in the making when I kind of entered into this world of trying to use physical movement for social movement, I was doing it alone and you know, at first I was handing out sandwiches to people on the street. And obviously, it\'s quite a tactical approach where it\'s just me out there giving someone one meal and providing just one meal that reduces a tiny bit of suffering. It isn\'t really changing anything systemic. \xa0So then I kind of segued into doing these DIY organized ultra marathons for causes where I\'d raise a lot of money. And they were great but they were always this kind of prevents where a big pulse - a lot of people would rally behind them. We\'d raise tens of thousands of dollars that would go to a cause. But it was a bit of a pulse. So I was like, ""How can I create something that is more holistic?"" And just seeing politics in the US and politics in the UK with Brexit, I saw more and more divisiveness. And then online I\'m seeing virtue signaling, I\'m seeing echo chambers. And I just realized there\'s this strange kind of reality right now that we\'ve never been more connected yet we\'re so less inner connected in terms of how we interact. So I came up with this idea, essentially, of having this walking program of putting strangers together over a cup of coffee to walk and talk a mile in each other\'s shoes. Just to have the 30 minutes of exercise where one walker answers a question on the first mile as the other listens and on the second mile that inverts. Simply to power human exchanges from people - no pun intended - from different walks of life to create these heartfelt exchanges. Because I believe knowledge exchange isn\'t only at the basis of a strong democracy but is fundamental to having empathy for one another in a way that\'s a first-hand account.', 'BEN: \xa0So luckily I work for a really cool company that has always been super supportive of all the initiatives and we moved into a really awesome new office last year that\'s kind of street level in Toronto, right in the hub of the community. And it\'s actually an old church that was retrofitted to later being a community center. It kind of languished for a bit and then we took over it. So it\'s always kind of had this role in the community and we\'ve always kind of thought about how we could kind of like celebrate that. So I\'ve just been generating this idea to take advantage of our new physical footprint. And so the idea is essentially, it\'s, if you were to dumb it down, it\'s essentially a walk in coffee club where you show up, you\'re given a free coffee and on the java jacket there\'s gonna be questions, you know, and these questions are kinda - they\'re just intended to span conversation. So they\'re not yes/no questions. They\'re questions that can be about just highly personal things. So could be, you know, ""What is your greatest fear."" \xa0Or, ""What was your first heartbreak?"" To questions that kind of connect back to maybe more political subjects. Like, ""Does your individual vote make a difference?"" In Canada right now we\'re going through the legalization of recreational cannabis. So we might ask, ""Is that a good or a bad thing?"" It\'s just meant to let people share a point of view and compare and contrast and have a discussion. So the two individuals as well as a map that has a unique little trail on it that\'s color-coded to show mile one and mile two. And it\'s just essentially a conversation where one person answers their question as the other listens and vice-versa. And then it\'s up to them basically to determine the extent at which they want to get into a discussion.', 'BEN: Totally. So I guess like you know I always kind of thing like about like any project I do; Why am I doing this? What\'s my right? \xa0What\'s the greater purpose? And so, I\'d be very fortunate to be able to walk all the way around the world. I think I\'ve knocked off four continents, major cities, some areas that are super sketchy. I\'ve been made acutely aware through my experiences that I have a level of freedom in my movement that is unparalleled. I\'m a white, probably upper-class person that can drop in and out of areas. And so I just had this realization of ""I can move through the world in a way that so few others can."" That\'s obviously unfortunate. So how can I use my movement as a means to open the door open for others to move. And so I was just kind of trying to conceptually frame it in my mind and that led to the declaration of human rights where it kind of like argues for people\'s right to life, liberty, security, and then I read freedom of movement. And that really resonated with me. Obviously, it speaks to the fact that citizens within a country shouldn\'t have their movement suppressed moving from a to b. But it also connected to my belief in how free movement, which is movement that can be freely done or movement that has no cost outside of exercise and gym memberships, can promote some of these virtues. Especially later in the UN declaration of human rights, it speaks to freedom of thought and expression in a peaceful assembly. So I just feel that a walking program where people are free to go where they want and free to speak as they choose really helps strengthen some of the core principles of a democracy. And quite often a lot of us aren\'t exercising that muscle of democracy. And we should.', ""BEN: It's a big question and it's a tough one to unpack. I think it's definitely made me more present when I walk. Everything from obeying traffic lights to not texting while I walk so I don't trip over a curb. So it definitely added a level of presence in my life that was unforeseen. And I find that really calm and meditative. \xa0And I think because I've been able to walk not just in my community but around the world, I've been able to see a lot in a way I wouldn't have had I been in a taxi cab. And it has increased my empathy tenfold, one hundred fold, I think. The more you're out in the world you realize that the world is a radically different place but there's also a ton of patterns. So just seeing how in cities poverty disproportionately affects women and children. And it's made me confront my privilege as well as what I think people of privilege should do to challenge their privilege and how to unlock it for others so all boats in the harbor will rise. And I happen to try to do that just through movement."", 'BEN: Oh man! \xa0So many. I mean I was in Istanbul right when the Syrian refugee crisis started to happen. And just seeing hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, I think, was like a big wake up call that no matter how busy you are, most of us can do something. So in that instance, I just did something small - just giving out water. \xa0But being confronted with a witness a humanitarian crisis, which I\'ve seen tens of thousands of time through television. But to experience in person was incredibly powerful. And that spanned to, you know, I walked through the redwoods when I was out in the San Francisco area with you. And that was just amazing in terms of you know in one area you can be so significant and make a difference and then you walk in the redwoods and you just realize we\'re so insignificant. We\'re so small within the grandeur of nature. So just been tons of moments like that, I\'ve seen countless people propose, do marriage proposals. Just a lot of beautiful, small, moments that are so small and nuanced but I think just helped me have a positive because I get to see so many little magical moments. \xa0And a lot of the time I find people are like, ""Why don\'t you just go biking. Why don\'t you just go running?"" And for me it\'s like not about blasting through space and time, it\'s about enjoying space and time. And walking has a slow pace that allows me to see slow small nuanced things.', ""BEN: Yeah. It's funny because I don't even think about physical fitness and that component. \xa0It's funny. I love going and walking around the world because I find the world so inspiring for both the positive and the negative reasons. So I think, without sounding corny, it's soul fulfilling. Just to be out in the world and be present and to witness it first hand versus clips on the news or people's photographs on social media, so, for me I think it's about being out in the world and walking through it lets me be a participant in the world as both an observer and as someone who can enact small forms of change."", 'BEN: I think my pursuit of - it\'s kind of funny. When I first started walking there was definitely this - the impetus was to get in ""better shape"". But I kind of arrived at that years ago. People were ""Why are you still walking?"" \xa0They\'re like, ""You\'re fit now."" Kind of like the program, the credits have run, the movie\'s over. And I\'m like, my belief is health is never something you can just contain. You have to walk towards it every day. And secondly, I\'ve had a kind of revolution myself where walking to me isn\'t about fitness or exercise. It\'s about being present in the world and being a participant and being inspired by it.', ""BEN: \xa0I'm on Instagram @benpobjoy. \xa0I typically use it just to share photos from my walk, so if you are curious where I walk and the funny things that I get to see, that is a place to find me personally. And then on Facebook and Instagram, we're launching Democratic Exercise all one word, and "", "" is gonna be our URL where people will be able to find information about the program. I live in Toronto so we're launching the program there but the aspiration is to create a module that other communities will be able to download and freely organize programs in their own communities to kind of borrow from an open source model."", 'BEN: Get out there. The world is beautiful. It can be inspiring and depressing but every day you will see something magical and it will make you smile and inspire you to walk the next day and be out present in the world.', 'BEN: Always a pleasure. And vice versa you. Thank you for ...not many people know that you are the catalyst- hearing you on a podcast that inspired you. So if I can now be on your podcast and inspire that in someone else it really shows how movement has these reverberations that can improve all of us.', ""KATY: Yes. Community. Right? It's just stacking back with some community. So I appreciate you doing that in real time. Real human to human connection. Thank you so much."", 'BEN; Thank you, Katy.', 'KATY: Ben Pobjoy is an avid walker who is passionate about converting his physical movement into social movement. His latest endeavor is called ', '.

You can find out more at ', '. And we’ll put a link in our show notes to that website, and to the ', '. \xa0', 'Time to answer one more question. This is from Charles. Charles asks:', '\n', ""Charles,\xa0ok, I've never met you before. I don't know what other types of movement that you've done so it's challenging to answer this question for you but in general, anytime anyone expresses an issue with the knee or the hip, I always recommend checking your foot mobility and footwear. Because as you step through life you've got all this mobility in your foot. And one of the reasons you have so much mobility in your foot is when you step on a surface your foot has the ability to change drastic shape. So that your knees and hips can kind of move in the direction that they were going. So if you have very stiff feet but if you have really mobile feet but very stiff shoes, when you repeatedly step on that then that kind of complex deformation doesn't happen at the foot. It gets kind of passed up to the knee or to the hip. That's one scenario. Of course there could be a hundred if not a thousand other factors. That all being said, I always say start with your feet. And start checking out the way you load that particular hip. So clearly you've loaded that hip in a particular way - you load your whole body in a particular way and that includes that hip. The way that you loaded it eventually changed the state of that hip. \xa0And then you started changing that load away from that hip to the other side and now that knee is dealing with maybe carrying more weight. And it's not just weight. It's the angles and the acceleration that are new to that knee. So I would recommend starting with your feet. And you can find a bunch of stuff on my website. "", ' is also a great resource to go, ""Ok, so here\'s some ways I can introduce motion to my foot and my ankle"" as well as practice some motions where, as you\'re moving let\'s say doing some calf raises, as you do calf raises can you keep your weight even between both feet? Do your ankles fall out? \xa0Does your rib cage slide to one side? Are you able to use your musculature to in a way that maintains symmetry. So a lot of my books are just helping you put your body on a grid. Say, I want to move in this particular way and see what you\'re able to stabilize and what you\'re not able to stabilize and then you scale the exercise to be able to recruit more of you too when you are walking around from point a to point b. Now the other side of that is you use your hip in a particular way over and over again. So kind of the idea of corrective exercise. That\'s just a name for it but the idea is maybe try to diversify the movement of that hip a little bit. \xa0So it\'s not like you\'re trying to change the state of the tissue. That\'s not your primary concern. You\'re going to diversify. You\'re gonna do some different exercises of both of your hips. Of both of your knees. Of both of your ankles. And you\'re gonna start playing around with, ""When I add maybe"", you think about nutrients. ""If I introduce some other movement food does that change kind of the resting state of how my hip feels."" What\'s expressing the experience that you\'re having of your hip. So you\'ve got looking at your feet. Looking at your shoes. Doing some exercises, not with the intention of making your hip better - to fix the problem, but rather, what happens to the issue when you add a little bit more nutrition to the movement of the hips. And that is to use it in different ways. That\'s through exercise. Now the next part of that would be through non-exercise ways which would be, look at, or try to quantify what you walk on most of the time. \xa0Is it mostly city streets? Is it the same path? Is it the same shape over and over again? Because I\'ve worked with people who have had various pains or more serious injuries in certain areas and they found that when they diversified what they were walking over that the natural byproduct of changing your terrain would be to not create that same load in the hip over and over again. So someone who couldn\'t walk comfortably down their normal urban route could take to a park or a natural landscape and find that they could walk just fine the same distance. But because of the lumps and the bumps it never placed the same load on the hip. So you can play with that too and see if that changes it. But again, I would maybe deal with the first two first and then maybe hop into the third as you feel comfortable. ', 'So thanks to the ', "", sponsoring these listener questions.\xa0Today we're going to talk about "", "" for a second. And I was just looking again at Venn Design's website because I've had, I have one design ball which is just - they make really beautiful covers for regular exercise balls but I've been wanting some of their cushions because I've had our cushions for about 5 years which means my floor cushions have kind of grown up with two children that are now five and almost 7.

I am Katy Bowman, biomechanist and author of Move Your DNA and a bunch of other books about movement. This show is about how movement works on the cellular level, how to change your position as you move, and why you might want to, and how movement works in the world, also known as movement ecology. All bodies are welcome. \xa0Are you ready to get moving?"", 'Music', 'Ted, ouch! \xa0Sorry. Ok, so I\'m reading this and I\'m thinking a bunch of different things. So I don\'t know what your running is like, so minimal running can be off-road, it might be cement. I\'m gonna assume that your crossfit is probably done inside. I could be wrong but that would be my assumption. I\'m not certain of the consumption of moving on hard, flat, and level that you had. So, here\'s the thing. \xa0It\'s interesting with ""I\'ve been doing this for this long period of time and now it\'s bothering me"" where we think just because we\'ve always done it that that means it will always be fine. But rather you can always do something and be slowly kind of like slowly working through a tissue or creating a cumulative tissue damage which then appears, and you\'re like, ""I want to go back to doing the thing"" but maybe there was something all along that was kind of in-process a little bit. I\'m not able to know that. And maybe you\'re not able to know it as well. But these are some of the things that you\'re going to think about. \xa0""Was I running varied courses in varying ways or would I have had the same type of foot strike over and over again?"" I\'m also not sure if you have plantar fasciitis in one or both feet, because when it\'s in a single foot versus both then I\'d be kind of like, ""ok, well, given that your structure is fairly evenly distributed there\'s a way that you\'re loading one foot versus the other."" If it\'s both feet that could not be the case. Then you also, though, know that you added, at one glance it looks like you added two things: karate and a dynamic workstation, but that could also be that if you converted it to hours, that could mean that to your feet you added 6 extra hours of daily motion. So maybe if you had a form issue, meaning a distribution of mass. So not only just the arrangement of your pieces but the mass distribution that the arrangement of pieces creates, now you are loading that maybe imbalanced structure (that just means that you\'re not distributing your weight evenly on both sides), you added a tremendous volume load to your feet. So if you had some preexisting damage that at that lower volume of movement you were tolerating but then this greater volume caused you to then get back to what you were saying - square one. So then I\'m wondering; Did you have plantar fasciitis before? \xa0Or all these things. If I could just ... maybe I\'ll interview you for my next episode. But anyway, this is going to be helpful for a lot of people to begin to think through their own situations. So, you did add quite a bit of volume, so I would look there. And I assume that in doing karate you are barefoot, so is that your only barefoot activity? So then the question is; ""Is there information in one of your books?"" I guess I\'m thinking ', "" because the exercises in that would help you see if in your resting position if you are more on one side versus the other so can you start doing some of these few, simple exercises to help you figure out if you're distributing the work of moving your body forward when you're walking or running evenly through both sides or do you have one side that's kind of like rowing harder a little bit - so to speak? \xa0Play with terrain. Maybe not when you're in such an acute state. But is there a way to vary the load to your feet once you're better. So try "", "". \xa0There's a couple of "", "". It's challenging to learn movement through text. So if you're not a text lover ... I mean I do think there's enough stuff in "", "" that would give you - like calf raises. \xa0Can you do some calf raises? I call them elevators because instead of just going up and down I want you to be looking at your ankles in a mirror to make sure as you go up and down you're not noticing your ankles dropping out to the side. And then you can check out a couple of "", "" and start playing around with those including using a ball on the feet. \xa0So in the end, all those correctives are trying to diversify the load that your feet are experiencing. \xa0And so, another thing, thinking back. You've been wearing minimal shoes for a long time but I don't know what correctives you did before you got in there, so that's the thing with shoes. \xa0Shoes offer a bit of support in kind of like a hard flat world. When you don't have a ton of foot strength. And maybe because we sit so much even hip or leg strength. So when we transition to them over time without adding that strength back in you can see kind of an issue. But you've been wearing them for 10 years. That's quite a bit of time. \xa0So anyway, try that, check that out, and hopefully that helps. Thank you Ted for asking and thank you to our "", ' for supporting listener questions.

Kia ora, Ihi welcome to Move Your DNA."", 'IHI: (speaks in Māori language) That means Hello back to you in Māo.', ""KATY: \xa0I love it. That was good. I was rushing to get my Māori dictionary so I could respond appropriately! \xa0I'm very excited that you are here. There's a lot that we could talk about but I have to kind of narrow it down to be respectful of time. So there's two things that I wanted to start off talking about and the first is, what is a Atua Matua Māori Health Framework - is the first part of the question. The second part of the question is how does that relate to this line in your bio which is: \xa0Dr. Heke is a strong supporter of mountain and river connections that can be converted into traditional physical activity and training opportunities suggesting that gains in health can be incidental outcomes that begin with connections to rivers and mountains?"", ""IHI: \xa0Well it sounds really hardcore when you say it like that but I don't know that it is. We as Māori are the youngest indigenous population on the planet. \xa0New Zealand has only been populated for something like maybe 1500 years. It's a difficult island to get to. No natural currents or winds push this way. But Māori are moving all through the Pacific and this is one of the final places that we came to rest. \xa0Because of that, in terms of indigenous views on the world, we were the last to have the colonizing effects of the English here. So we have held on to our customs and our traditions fairly strongly. And when we disagree with our government, we tell them, very vocally. \xa0And if we still don't like what they're doing we build our own and design our own Māori health framework such as the Atua Matua option. It was something I built in 2014 more to monitor my own approaches to how I work with Māori communities so that I wasn't further institutionalizing or colonizing their minds by using university-based concepts with Māori communities and embedding those colonized views even further. So, in 2014 I looked at some of the environmental representatives that we as Māori use a lot. We call those Atua. Atua are personifications and guardians that overrule or look out for things that happen in different environments. At the moment most Māori could tell you seven or eight of those but as we uncover more information we're at around 150 different environmental representatives and their roles. Atua Matua looks at 12 levels of Atua influence. \xa0And the 12 outcomes that we have as humans that can be learned from knowledge that's collected together from mountains and from water. So, if you like, in essence, Atua Matua is ways of knowing, learning, and practicing that come directly from the environment."", 'IHI: I could talk you to death on this topic. You know that, Katy.', 'KATY: I know. Do it!', 'IHI: \xa0You\'ve got to bump in now and then or I\'ll just get carried away and forget we\'re even in an interview but, what\'s happened ... around early 1900s - 1908, I think it was there was the\xa0Tohunga Suppression Act passed by our government which meant that any traditional practices that were conveyed to Māori communities were illegal. So this information I\'m talking about has been gone for 110 years. We\'re reinstituting it and saying ""Well actually if you want health to change in someone Māori, it can\'t be about people."" \xa0So health, in our opinion, has nothing to do with people. Health is more of an understanding of the environments that cause you to be the way you are. And so in our country, we have tribal groups that live near mountains, some that are near rivers, some that are on plains, and some that are near the ocean. And for that tribal group to survive and flourish, they need to understand the environment at its peak and know the ways to align to it so that they can survive. Collect together the attributes for them to do that and to develop in a way, both physiologically, psychologically, and spiritually in ways that allow that tribe to align best. And that\'s what we\'ve done. Albeit subconsciously for quite a few. They don\'t know that they have the muscularity, the intellect, even the skin color and stature that\'s required to exist best in that place. But we have. And so this discussion and the framework that I\'ve built was to contextualize why. Not what we do but why we would engage, or not. And use that as the basis for making changes. Because, and I think is probably the same for non-indigenous groups, our biggest issues are recruitment and sustainability. First, how are we gonna get Māori to come through the door and have a look at what we\'re suggesting? And if they do, how are we going to keep them there? And at the moment physical activity and health don\'t do that. They won\'t sustain effort from Māori. Even though intellectually they know it\'s in their best interest to do that. But after 4 or 5 weeks they\'re not sustaining effort in those places because it\'s around the concept that humans are important. And to be blunt, we\'re not. \xa0We might exist 80 years but we have mountains that are millions of years old and in that million or so years, they\'ve collected together a lot of knowledge that has huge amount of potential benefit for the way we conduct our lives. What we\'re doing is contextualizing that information better for ways that they can learn and move forward. That make sense?', ""KATY: Yeah. So it's like health is something that's an anthropocentric perspective which means you do something purely to keep yourself well but if you don't identify as being the most important thing in your environment then pursuing health for that reason makes no cultural sense. Is that right?"", ""IHI: \xa0Yeah, well there's a lot of different models around this but a well-known one from education is the Chet Bromfield that talks about the social-ecological model that begins with the learner or in the health context that's the patient at the center and everything else should be structured around them for them to be able to improve. We don't think that's the case at all. The environment is at the center. And every other aspect spins out from that ending in the individual on the periphery sometimes, if they're smart enough, understanding whatever the water and mountains are trying to teach them. And stars are too actually. \xa0And by that I mean that it's not as though you have to have - well in some ways you do I suppose but - at the moment most Māori are the wrong set of glasses and have the wrong hearing aid on. So they can't hear what water's trying to do. But if you sit next to the ocean or a gurgling river, what happens after a half an hour as you feel more relaxed - you feel reinvigorated and ready to do something else but can't quite put your finger on or verbalize what's occurring, that form of language when it's coming from a river when it's slowly burbling away - there is a form of healing. I don't want to get into that space of thinking that I'm a little bit way out there that I can talk to rivers. It's not that case at all. \xa0If you want to have it in a more concrete form, that means that when we go to the river, that's why I want to improve agility, then I understand the knowledge base that caused the rock to be a smooth shape so that I can move my feet across it and cause agility to be shown in me. Our river did that. Not me. But I have the potential to benefit in the way that I might play a sport because I understand that a river caused that round shape by its flowing across it."", 'KATY: So movement is not really separatable from knowledge in that way, right?', ""IHI: \xa0No. That's an interesting part there that some of the early intellectuals - if you want to call them that - Descartes, a number of other Greek authorities on that sought to separate the mind, body, soul concept. \xa0As Māori, we didn't believe you could. That all of them were interlinked. And that when you engaged with the environment there's a spiritual, there's a psychological, and a physical aspect of that place and of us. And that each one of those lines of thinking can connect up. Mostly what happens is people try to connect up on a physical level but they don't understand what psychological and ... spiritual is probably the wrong term for ways that we connect to environments but, in essence, when we're talking about spirit we're talking about an ability to connect up to the essence of a place. For example, one of the things I see a lot in surfers is that people think that they're looking for the perfect wave when they go out surfing. We don't think they are. They're looking for the essence of the representative of the place that comes from the ocean. And once you understand the personality of the Atua, of the ocean, then you'll be able to stand up on a wave which is a representation of pure essence that comes from the ocean. And that's what you're looking for. Not a wave. Just an expression of essence."", 'KATY: Now I have that as a quote to talk about later because that really stood out for me when you were talking - when I heard you speak at the ancestral health conference and the quote is: \xa0""Even some surfers think that they\'re out searching for a perfect wave but from a Māori perspective they\'re not at all. They\'re searching for the life force that the ocean represents."" End quote. \xa0That was you by the way. It was beautiful.', 'IHI: \xa0Was it.', 'KATY: It was great. Fantastic. \xa0', 'IHI: Sounds like me.', ""KATY: Exactly like you. \xa0So I'm actually processing what you're saying right now but my mouth is going to say something else which is not unique for me at all. So the quote that I pulled - and there's a lot of videos of you out there so if anyone wants to sit and listen and kind of let these ideas wash over you, you've done plenty on "", ' which are great. \xa0But the quote is: ""At the moment we are practicing someone else\'s model of what health looks like. At the moment we\'re focusing on health as something we have to pursue. Health should be an incidental outcome. It should be something that pops out at the other end when you understand ancestral knowledge.""', 'IHI: \xa0No. Not at all. As your husband knows, I\'m half Irish. I\'m from Aerana. So there\'s part of me that has a tendency to understand the Irish landscape and the way that\'s caused me to- and formed certain personality traits. One of the things that I often hear from New Zealanders, as is non-indigenous people that live here as well, is ""How does this affect me. What does this mean to me if I\'m a New Zealander?"" And what I say to them is whether you\'re indigenous or not, you have experiences from four or five years old are connecting to a beach or a lake or a river or a mountain that cause you to want to continue to return to that place. And it\'s those experiences that are universal - right across all humans. \xa0We make connects to people and sometimes to places but what I\'m suggesting is that connection to place is in a space that has longevity - that will continue to drive us to return over and over and over. And I think what happens and I\'ve used this as an example with some of the Māori communities that I\'ve worked with is that ... In a coastal town, I was working at, I had two boys come to me and they said, ""Oh we want to do the Boston marathon."" And I said, ""Oh great. Are you from Boston?"" And they said, ""No."" So, ""What are you going there for?"" And they said, ""Well, it sounded like a good idea."" I said, ""Do you know your own mountain? Do you know your own area? Have you run over these places first and got the experience and the knowledge base that can come from your own mountain?"" \xa0""No"" ""Ok then start there."" So we started and I said each morning we\'re gonna run up there but we\'re gonna change the reason that we\'re there. So the first morning was there because we wanted the physical run from it. I said that\'s ok. We\'ll run up, up until we get tired. Run on a spot, carry on a little bit more. The second hour said we\'re here for a psychological experience. So today we\'re not gonna run the track. We\'re gonna run straight. And whatever you come across you deal with it. So on the way from our house to the mountain is the river. So I said, we don\'t go across the bridge, you go through the middle of it. The third day, was about the essence or light force of the place. And what we found on the mountain was that there had been locations where particular formations had developed. There were places where waterfalls were flowing. \xa0There were places where there were natural divots that were big enough for us to lie down on. So that\'s what we did. We went there, we laid down and we talked about our connections to place, our connections to why we were doing the things we were doing. But each time we did it it was creating a connection to a place. Now as Māori we can show a more recent historical ancestral connection to that quite a few non-indigenous can\'t. But my point is that you still have those same feelings. You still have those experiences there. You may not be able to verbalize them and ironically neither can ours. Neither can Māori but, you still have that connection to place that is equally as valuable as non-indigenous. The way you discussed it with others is different. And sometimes what I see happening is non-indigenous people trying to claim indigenous process as theirs. \xa0And especially information. I said that\'s not right. You can\'t do that part. But you can talk about the similarities between the way you engage with a place and the way someone indigenous does as well. Not to say one is better or worse. But I do because my way with things are better.', ""KATY: laughs. \xa0Well, you have to be right. You're the expert. Right? \xa0You have to say it how it is."", ""IHI: No. I mean to say that my understanding of my rivers from my district is mine. And it's the way I do it. So for me, it has to be the best way. But all I can do for other people is show them examples... that's what the videos and the discussions are. \xa0An attempt to show our model of examples that contextualize the way I think. And once I understand why I think some - in a particular manner, the rest of it's quite easy. But until I can get to that why do I do the things that I do, then if I try and in a more what about cross fit or what about a running program, it's not gonna work. Because there's no contextual relevance for why I would sustain it within that place. And non-indigenous are exactly the same here. That unless you can prove why you connect and why it might be relevant, the chances of you carrying on are very slim. \xa0And if it was for health's sake or for physical activity, none of us would be getting overweight and none of us would be unfit. We'd all be fine. But we're not. So in essence what we have to pursue is the knowledge that's represented by different environments. And that's universal for sure."", ""IHI: \xa0Well that's surprising. I didn't even think you were listening to me most of the time I was talking. Because I was just flapping head."", ""KATY: I'm sorry what? \xa0Did you say something?"", ""IHI: Yeah, what's that noise. So when I was discussing those ideas it's that subconsciously we tend to reflect the attributes and personality traits of environmental attributes as Māori. \xa0And we personify environments for a couple of reasons. One of them is that if we do that we have obligations to it which means we can't leave behind. We can't understand our existence without knowing those places. But we've been forced into a space where we do at the moment because we're trying to use the New Zealand government version of what health looks like. And in that space, you don't acknowledge the environment. You forget all of that and it's about you as a human. And we say that's actually a load of crap. \xa0Secondly, when it comes to understanding the reasons that you've developed the way you are, there's some consistent aspects that continue to show themselves in people from certain places. Now some of these things that ... and some of them are quite tongue in cheek as well but we laugh and my grandparents from that year and backward, they were very astute at being able to pick where someone was from before they even spoke about what their tribal area was. But in general, we have some of those traits. If we're - and I'm from a river. I'm from the Waikato river which is the central north island of New Zealand and it's a big strong flowing river that comes off one of the central mountains as well as the central plains. And I tend to have the personality traits that come from a river. I'll listen to people for a while. I'll put up with it. Put up with it. Then I'll go around them or over them but I'm carrying on. I'll continue to postulate and espouse certain ideas to get to the end point that I'm after. Which is, in this case, I'm looking at what benefits we might be able to glean from understanding the environment. \xa0So that's my main driver. Even though I can't use health and physical activity in that discussion, I would like our people and especially our tribal groups to last longer. Five weeks ago my brother died at 53 and my father died at 46. So our people don't make it very long at the moment. So we're trying to, in essence, make sure that we have more longevity and through the pursuit of knowledge that comes from our environment, make sure that our tribal groups strengthen their genetic material by understanding the things that cause us to think a certain way. So I think in essence being able to understand why a person will react a certain way, why they'll reflect the place they come from. Another funny example and I teased them often about this, is the ones that come from the coast is - we have a monthly cycle of concepts called the maramataka - and you can find these online and you can read about them. What they are is that in districts Māori would put out each month depending on the lunar cycle which days were better for planting, which would be good for fishing and what I've been proposing and which days are better for certain types of physical activity depending on lunar cycles. So these are hundreds and hundreds of years old, the ones that we use for hunting and fishing and so on - and gardening. But they haven't been applied to human performance in a long time and we're reinstituting that. And these are things like on days when we have an incoming tide arriving on sunrise means that we're bringing new nutrients and then we have the sunrise or a rival of a full-blown sun that we're - those are double power days. So we're good for producing power outputs. Versus other days when the moon is waning and we don't celebrate the death of the moon. As Māori, we tend to have quiet periods during that but those are rehab days. And on other days we have agility. On other days we have quickness training. On other days we have balance and coordination. So each lunar day changes in terms of what we can show as an output. \xa0And my point is and my example here is that for fellows that live near the coast we often tease them and say that well, we can't afford to come and meet with you on an outgoing tide because you're not going to be there. We come to lecture and you're not interested. But if it's an incoming tide you're happy for new information to be brought in to your community. And they are. But what we say about them is that they're only good for 12 hours. The other 12 they're gone somewhere."", 'KATY: Well you\'re a river. And the quote I have is: ""I\'m from a river. \xa0The way I deal with things is to go around them or to wear them down."" Which I love. \xa0But let\'s talk about your bike trip. What are your favorite modes of movement? The ones that connect you the most.', 'IHI: \xa0Well, I think cycling is the dopiest of all of them because you\'re in one position with your neck stuck out and your lower body is doing everything and your upper body is going ""bugger off"". However, I grew up in a very mountainous area which didn\'t quite suit my background as a river, but there are a number of alpine rivers that are coming off those. So I spent a lot of time up in those places, looking at rivers and getting out into the far reaches of alpine areas and a mountain bike suited me to do that. So I learned from a really young age that I could access more information, subconsciously - I didn\'t really know what it was that I was looking for. And I\'ve only really been in the last 7 or 8 years been able to verbalize what had achieved. \xa0But, I like the idea of being able to use a mountain bike for the mountain\'s sake and not for the bike\'s sake. And often a lot of the people I work with will tell me how new the technology is on their bike and I really couldn\'t give a rat\'s backside. It\'s got wheels and it goes round and that\'s lovely. We\'ve got to stay grounded in the idea that a mountain bike will connect you to mountains in much the same way as an outrigger canoe will allow me to experience the ocean and the sea. So they\'re mediums for delivery. And with the concepts that we\'ve been promoting around Atua Matua frameworks is that in the past our ministry of health and education has presumed that to deliver any interventions aimed at indigenous people, they have to use indigenous or Māori methodologies and modes of transport to deliver that. \xa0And there were only four. And, for example, that was outrigger canoes, Kapa Haka performing arts, Mau rākau, which is a form of stick fighting, and Mamau which is like a type of martial arts. What I\'ve been suggesting is that the medium is just that. It\'s a medium for the delivery of concepts that come from a Māori origin. So I can, for example, I\'ve been teaching through snowboarding and skateboarding Māori assistant procedures by having groups of 3 people and in that group of 3 one of them is going to experience what we call, and it\'s come from my name Ihi, where you\'ll be on the edge of a mountainside, looking off the edge and you\'ll be crapping your pants saying I might die but I might be able to do it.', 'KATY: Wow, have we gone to snowboarding before? \xa0It seems like you just read my mind.', 'IHI: \xa0No. Not sure but the second person is a rather interesting one, they\'re watching the other person. And I call it the wehi phase. And the wehi is where you feel fear for someone else because you\'re not sure if they\'ve got the capacity to pull off what they think they can. But you\'re gonna watch anyway. \xa0It\'s kind of like that train crash kind of thing - ""I\'m gonna watch and see what happens."" And there\'s another person in the wonder phase. Watching the interaction between the two: the ihi and wehi phase. And what happens is the person starts or doesn\'t but a few minutes later there\'s a discussion between the three of the things that went on. And it\'s an assessment procedure that comes from Māori. \xa0And the medium of delivery is snowboarding. But the snowboarding doesn\'t matter. It\'s the knowledge that the mountain caused to happen to all three of them. Because they\'re on the side of the mountain. And if the mountain wasn\'t there, none of this would have begun. Does that make sense?', 'KATY: Yes. Beautiful.', ""IHI: Good. \xa0Never been called that before. People just look at me as I'm a bit odd."", ""KATY: We call you beautiful behind your back after you've left is what we say."", 'IHI: \xa0Yeah. I bet that happens.', ""KATY: It does happen sometimes. \xa0Well, and I'm thinking, you know, these modes that you're talking about to me, I've heard you talk about the relationship of your mountain bike with the mountains and I also think of you the river. It gives you such a fluid, a fluid downhill motion to. At least the downhill part where you can still, still be a river even on the mountain. You know you're still a river - you're still riverish moving down a mountain. But let's talk - I want to talk about your bike trip a bit because to me that adds the medium. The medium was cycling that you used to go check out the water of your people.\xa0So can you talk about - just give us a little information about what the trip entailed and what the purpose of it was and maybe what the experience of it was."", ""IHI: \xa0Well there's a couple of things that come up there. One of them was, you know you were just talking about my background as if it was snowboarding but I also use mountain biking - they kind of connect to rivers and so on. But, depending on which area you're from, when you're talk about water we have ways of showing a genetic connection between humans through those places. And if I'm from a mountain area then what I talk about is that there's a god of storms that produces the first snowflake that becomes the first raindrop. And as Māori we talk about the life essence of water and that everything it touches it removes some of that life essence until you get to the polluted form that has no life essence. And when you step into that as a human that's what causes you to lose life essence from you into that water. And that's why we say it is a dangerous place to be. Because it has to balance itself as water and it's trying to do that. And why I'm telling you this is that when that rainfall drops and then it touches the earth, then it shifts into another phase that makes it palatable and ready for humans to engage with. That then turns into the first, what we call lacuna which is the first drops coalescing into a stream and then it becomes the awa which is the river, then it becomes the roto, which is the lake, then it becomes the fana which is the harbor, and then it becomes the tae which is the ocean. And what I just told you there is for a mountain person it gives the hierarchical preference to the mountain of the origin of water because it formed from the first drop that touched the mountain but it ends in the ocean. If I'm from the ocean and I live on a coastal area I'm gonna start from the other end and have Tangaroa, the god of the ocean at the top of that hierarchy. And move in a different way of what causes water to form. \xa0So from an ocean person's perspective everything ends up being salt water. Because no matter where it is it's gonna end up out in the ocean and becomes the culmination of all forms of water. And as Māori, we know there's quite a few types of water. We have water that's in swamps. That's wairepo. We have water that's in areas where there's estuaries. We have puna, which is water that comes up out of the ground. And incidentally, those puna that we have we would use them for different activities. So some were for healing. Some were for post warfare, for cleansing. Some of them were our equivalent to Gatorade and we would use them before we were going to do physical activity. Each one of those springs was used for a different activity and rationale. We have different types of ocean water depending on the color of it. We have different colors of lake water and ocean water depending on which wind is interacting with it. If we have a southerly wind - because in the southern hemisphere the cold winds come out of the south - not like the north for you. But when we have a south wind come in, it changes water to a dark black before it arrives. So we know which wind is on the way by the color that we see change in the water body that we're sitting next to. So we use them as predictors for how our personality traits will therefore change because when a southerly comes we start to hunch our shoulders and close down because we know the cold is on its way. So you see the connection between all those different forms of water. And there's a whole range more. In fact one of the things that happened with the ministry of health here is they talk about hauora which is a new word for health, and oranga, that's another way of looking at health. There's not much discussion of that in the pre-European context. What we've talked about was the waiora tinana. Wai is water so it's the life essence that comes from water. So pre-European times we were very interested in water and what it caused in us. But that bike trip we're talking about there, 2016 "", ""KATY: Yeah. \xa0Will you do another one, do you think? \xa0You did one for mountains, one for water. I'm thinking you don't really need to do one for stars but I wonder what it would ... would the stars change as you..."", ""IHI: Yes absolutely. We'll do another one for stars but hopefully what I would do with that one is show a collection of videos that are spread across a year. For example one of the things that I talk to schools about at the moment is the idea that we can get risk assessment based on what shifts we see in our environment. At the moment most schools tend to use meteorological service where they go online and it tells them what weather is coming. In the past, we didn't have internet so we used a system of understanding. For example, this is a reasonably simplified version of it, but we had five indicators that we would follow from the environment. One of them was looking at insects. Another one was looking at birds. \xa0Another one was trees. Another one was fish. And the last one was star movements or what was happening in the atmosphere. That last phase of looking at what stars do - for example, we can predict weather changes based on which stars have shrouds or have halos or have changes in them that will help us predict 2 weeks ahead. Sometimes further. And we're trying to teach our children to be able to read what those signs are and they can feed that back to us via a risk assessment process about whether they should leave the school grounds to engage with outdoor education. So it's reasonably simple\xa0"", ""to us, but some are finding we are in a bit of a struggle to get their heads around. But it's quite cool stuff. And our kids are really enjoying it. So one of the schools that I work with up in the north of where I am here, we've got a bunch of spiders that we've asked the janitor to leave on the school grounds. And we read those spiders fairly regularly. One of them is that, if we pull the spider web apart and then go off and do an exercise and come back, how much of it's been rebuilt gives us a measurement of time from the insect that's based in that area. We also use it for tracking people so that we can see how many bikes have been through an area. \xa0Because if they go down one pathway then the cobweb will still be there. Verse one where it's been broken if they've traveled down that path. Spiders, for us, have three different web types so we can see from that which type of vehicle is being used. So if they have the sheet web that lays on the ground we can look early in the morning we can see how many people have passed over it. Pretty basic stuff to us but there's a lot of people who have forgotten how to do that. But, in essence, those bike rides and paddling and so on is to reintroduce that information back into Māori communities. So from those bike rides the aim was, 100 kilometers a day, 3000 ks over thirty days to make the Maramataka that shows us what lunar effects might be happening to us physically and show a video of environmental science that coordinates or explains occurrences across a month from a Māori perspective."", 'KATY: Did you do it by yourself or did you take a group - meet a group?', ""IHI: I did it by myself because I'm not that sociable. \xa0And not that easy to get along with."", 'IHI: Well it\'s a funny situation with the environment. Often what you\'re looking for isn\'t in the place where you would suspect it being because we have a particular way of expecting knowledge to be presented to us that we\'ve learned from institutes such as schools about how information is unloaded. The environment has a different way of teaching you that is often convoluted and odd. And the way that it delivers at times when you don\'t expect it to. And in mediums or domains that you weren\'t focused on but make the connections to. Before this - I\'ll explain this a little more - those lads that were wanting to and run the Boston marathon, they ended up running quite a few local mountains and then some national level mountains that were big ones and doing 8 and 10 hour runs. These are boys that are 140 kilos. \xa0They\'re big lads. Big Māori boys that had never run further than down to the local shop and back. But the motivation for them was they wanted to pursue higher and higher levels of knowledge. That didn\'t mean running to the top of a mountain and standing on the head of an ancestor and saying, ""I\'ve conquered you."" I said that\'s a non-indigenous process that we\'ve got nothing to do with. But through the process of getting up the side of that mountain, the mountain will have different steepnesses that will challenge you about whether you have the right to access the next level of knowledge. So a mountain will lay itself out with ways that you can recover, ways that are steep to filter whether that can get delivered to you. Now those lads that I had that were looking at how they can engage with the environment and in ways to understand things better. They came there for themselves initially - wanting to lose weight and get physically healthy. I said to them it\'s not sustainable otherwise you would have done it before and you would have made some changes. But I said what about if we look at say 20 different soil types. Or 20 different surfaces and we record the sound your feet makes when you move across wet grass, across gravel, across sand when there\'s a big swell and there\'s a wave that will come and will cover the sound of your feet every three or four seconds and then it will cover it again. I said why don\'t we go out and try to record 20 different soundtracks from 20 different soil types and surfaces. \xa0And then review those at the end and see if we can define which place it was that we were at. And the incidental outcome of that was that they learned to run. But it was never actually what we were after was to make them feel better or healthier or better runners. It was the pursuit of the knowledge about what sound was produced by their feet when they moved across and interacted directly through their feet with a different source of land. And my point is (there are always bloody long points, I\'m afraid Katy, there\'s never a short explanation) I\'ve found that information in gardening. I was looking at Maramataka, gardening came up and it led me on to the idea of wow, Māori explain 45 different types of soil. It was something like 10 different types of clay. Red, blue, yellow, some with bramble, some with sand. I didn\'t know the names or the intent of all of those different types of soil, but my application of it was I\'d like to know what they do, how they interact with each other and more importantly what happens when I move across it. But the incidental outcome was, if I did 20 days of recording, I would have four weeks of running from 5 days a week from taking these people out. And after a month of running, it\'s self-sustaining.', ""KATY: As I understand it, your perspective was created and is geared for the Māori people and the needs of your indigenous people maintaining their ancestral knowledge. Did you also write it for yourself? \xa0Did you gather more insight as you were assembling the framework? Which came first? Did you sit down to write a framework or was it just you're out in the garden and you have this experience and you recognize it needs to be included in the framework?"", 'IHI: \xa0It was a funny situation. \xa0You know I\'ve been an outdoor educator for more than 30 years. And not knowing that I was being taught all the time. And having a couple of close calls where I nearly didn\'t make it home. I thought, ""Wow, I nearly died today. That was a close one."" \xa0Realizing that I was trying for - the environment was trying to teach me life lessons. And you have to be open to those when they occur. And I wasn\'t. Until seven or eight years ago when I went to a Māori community and I said, ""Well we\'re gonna do this for physical training today."" And one of them said, ""Why? There\'s no food there. I\'m not going there. \xa0Can\'t see the point of it."" I said, ""Well, fair enough."" And then as I pushed further and further on, one of the communities said, ""I\'ll engage in some of these activities if they have a connection to my ancestral understanding of that place."" So they kicked me off into introducing or re-introducing traditional Māori games. And we had some, one called Ki O Rahi. This is blood interesting, this one. It was sponsored by McDonalds into 31,000 schools in the US in 2004 to be taught because they sponsored 3 indigenous games to be taught in schools. Māori here had never heard of the game because it had been long gone for over 100 years. I started teaching it here 18 years ago and there wasn\'t much interested in it. When I had a Māori community and started teaching them, they got it straight away. And why it was interesting to McDonald\'s and non-indigenous it\'s one of the very few games that has two teams playing against each other but with completely different outcomes that they\'re trying to achieve. One side of the team is trying to touch a post that\'s in the middle, the other side is trying to touch 7 posts that are around the outside and then come in the middle to score a touchdown. Those 7 posts represent the 7 stars of what we call Matariki. Which I think you call Subaru or Pleiades. So there was a whole range of high level knowledge they were teaching through the game and that\'s what people were actually after was the knowledge base of why we would do something. Now the interesting part about trying to get these fellows re-introduced to some of these old games was that they didn\'t know that that was what they were after but it felt as though when they engaged with these traditional knowledge bases, health and physical activity came more easily. Because knowledge \xa0became the center of why we were there. It became the overarching principle for why we would engage with each other through the environment. And so after a time of thinking about the way I actually had been making it worse for Māori communities by trying to teach institutionalized views of what physical activity looked like. It changed me. Because these people said ""I\'m not doing it."" So I had to reinvent a way of engaging with communities that wasn\'t about health or physical activity. And as a consequence, this Atua Matua and this new framework that I wrote, I wrote it for my own uses to ensure that I had an authentic way of connecting to communities that didn\'t have anything to do with health or physical activity. So when I first wrote it I didn\'t expect anyone to read it. And I\'m still surprised. And I know that quite a few people struggle with that. So out of - 9 out of 10 people that have read it said, ""I have no idea what you\'re talking about."" That it\'s just too complex. There\'s too much information and it seems like you\'re just talking out your backside. Well, in a lot of ways, I don\'t actually care. Because it only has to mean something to me because my particular lens has come from a river. So the examples I present are, if I was in this situation looking at it from a river knowledge perspective, this is how I would react. This is a model for you to maybe apply as a mountain person or as an ocean person that might convert what you\'re trying to do into those same incidental outcomes that could affect a change at a health or physical activity level. But with a focus on environmental knowledge first. And that\'s the essence of it. I wrote it to try and sort out my own crap. And I don\'t know if it made it worse.', ""KATY: Well we're almost out of time. But I know that other people are using the framework or are considering or you're helping other people apply it - other indigenous populations maybe or maybe even other areas who are Māori. \xa0Who are you working with and if there are people out there who want help within their own communities or have you come as a speaker where can they find you?"", ""IHI: \xa0Well, funny enough, that ancestral conference that I went to, I wasn't even sure I was there. Nice ideas and so but I'm not sure that I align with it and didn't know what the intent was for inviting me. \xa0And I enjoyed it and they're great people and so on. But I wasn't sure whether we would be in phase or not. Some of them were. Some of them weren't quite sure what I was up to. It just depends on that state of, or phase, of which you are and whether you're ready to assume this mantle. To be able to take on environmental knowledge takes a shift in your head. To be able to see things for what they might intend. It's a bit like that matrix moment of the red pill and the blue pill. You can carry on doing physical activity and health pursuits the way you are now and be moderately successful, but if you take the red pill or take the other rabbit hole, you'll find out a whole range of stuff that you never knew. And it opens up a whole world of information and approaches that give you a new insight into why you might do something. That, in essence, is why I've been following this pathway is that I'm not sure where this rabbit hole is going to go but I'm enjoying the process because it has more contextual relevance to the communities I work with and to the way I conduct myself and my roles in trying to promote health to Māori. As far as that's concerned in working with other communities, there's a number of videos that are on "", "". There's a Wānanga mobile facebook page called "", ' \xa0And there\'s a bunch of information on there as well. On teaching people how to build google earth virtual tours that show locations in their district, which pre-European Atua used to exist there, and how we can obtain physical activity and nutrition from those ancestral bodies of knowledge but deliver it via a medium that\'s come from google earth and it\'s digital. So those are going out at the moment. I\'m being funded through develop those for four schools in South Auckland. It\'s a 3 year program. The other ancestral check I was talking about, Zee from Ancestral Meeting, he\'s working with a group of powerlifters in San Diego and applying a Maramataka link to the way he\'s asking his powerlifters to lift on certain days and not others. That\'s aligning with lunar movements. I\'m working with groups in Japan that have had the Shinto religion which follows the environment and has been lost to a certain degree and now are interested in what we are doing here. \xa0I\'m working with groups in Ireland that I just visited. They\'ve been developing their version of Atua approaches which are called Trisula which is a set of 3 spirals that talk about different institutes of their lives and how they can engage with the environment better. And a number of first nation groups in the states that are starting to engage with some of these ideas. Non indigenous academics are accessing this through systems dynamics because when we talk about genetic connections that start from an environment and end at a human, those align really closely with systems concepts. So just put up a paper for review that does a comparison or an investigation of what systems dynamics does and what an Atua Matua approach does and how they mirror each other very closely. There\'s a bunch of information floating around out there. It\'s humbling that people would want to read it. I never intended anyone to. Often when they ring me and quiz me and want to know what it was I was talking about I\'m fairly abrupt and say ""I don\'t think I have to explain myself to you.""', ""KATY: You're gonna have to give the red pill. You're the red pill now. So you're the guy."", ""IHI: Yeah well maybe. \xa0I'm reasonably sure a lot don't actually want the blue pill and don't want to know."", 'KATY: They think they want the red pill but they really just want a slightly purple blue pill. \xa0Well, we can handle what we can handle.', 'IHI: Yeah, exactly.', ""KATY: Ok, well thank you very, very, very much.

So its like: \xa0watch your rib thrust in the water, vary your strokes so that a single bout of swimming can move more of you. I'm a wild water swimmer. My preference. But if I'm in a swimming pool my favorite way to be moving through that pool is just repetitive deep diving. Actually throwing things and not moving along the surface of the water but really trying to get myself down low and back up again. Sometimes I'll bind my feet, like pretend like I'm a mermaid. So I have all kinds of playful ways that I engage in pool swimming for example. But Ihi has made me want to pause here and suggest something here to you - to everyone. \xa0What makes swimming? Especially wild swimming (which is in natural bodies of water). What makes it possible or not? Is it the safety of the water, what we share the water with, how we’ve treated the water in the past, how maybe there is no water now, in the areas we in which we live? How does our lifelong relationship to water and everything really, affect how each of our shoulders end up moving through water - in a pool for example - during a bout of swimming? What does the capacity of our shoulders say about our historical relationship to water - moving through it or moving to get it? And what does the current state our shoulders say about our current relationship and knowledge of water? I'm just gonna leave that out there."", 'I’m going to thank Ihi and also the podcast sponsors for this last answer, which is really just a tunnel to a pile of questions that we can continue to consider.

I was trying to figure out which ones I was gonna read today and I'm not just flipping it open and, you know, wherever I land is the one that I read. I'm trying to go through some of the essays and pick out what my intent was when I was writing them and I found three essays that were done quite a bit apart but they all have this idea of definitions among them. And I think it's really interesting that a lot of my personal growth has been relating to the idea that words matter, obviously. Words hold lots of meaning and the way that you use them definitely changes what happens when you use them. And in my own personal work, I have always really been interested in definitions. So I don't tend to think in words I tend to think more in ... math would be the easiest thing to say but I really see physical relativity. That's how I understand the world. When I look at something - when someone's talking to me - I'm much less likely to perceive the words that they're using. It's just not the medium for me. But yet, I am, ironically, someone who uses a lot of words to process verbally. I write a lot and I think a lot of my writing and especially in "", "" times was me processing what I was perceiving spatially. It's like it's coming into me in lines and points and orientation of parts relative to other parts, and then I'm having to convert it into language which are symbols and not everyone holds the same meaning for symbols. So it's an unnatural state for me to really talk and write. And so the three essays that I've picked today are about the definitions and kind of how that changes how we feel about movement and the body and health and wellness and medicine and all those pieces. \xa0That definitions ultimately do matter because in this case - and I just recognized it right now as I was talking - at the end of "", ""I really call out the importance of definitions in a science that's really trying to figure out the structure, the spatial orientation. You know all of science is trying to explain natural phenomenon. So they can't ever do it sufficiently because we're using words to do it. An equation can be a little bit tighter but even then the phenomenon is not the equation or the words that are placed on top of it. Anyway, it was fun to go back and watch this personal evolution in myself. So, here we go."", 'I’m going to explain a little what is missing from the field of human science, but first, a few definitions.', 'Biological Science. Definition: A natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.', 'Physical Science. Definition: \xa0An encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. However, the term “physical” creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena.', 'Physiology: The science of the function of living systems. It is, I guess technically, a subcategory of biology.', 'Physics: A natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through spacetime, as well as all applicable concepts, including energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.', 'Anatomy: A branch of biology and medicine that is the consideration of the structure of living things.', 'Geometry (this is my favorite): “Earth-measuring” is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space.', 'Kinematics: In biomechanics and kinesiology, kinematics is a term for the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies without considering the forces (which is how the motion was created).', 'Kinetics: In physics and engineering, kinetics is a term for the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the relationship between the motion of bodies and the motion’s cause, namely forces and torques.', 'Engineering: The discipline, art, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials, and processes that safely realize solutions to the needs of society.', 'Medicine: The science and art of healing humans. It includes a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.', 'And don’t worry, there won’t be a quiz.', ""So here’s my point. The current academics in charge of researching disease, setting parameters for health, outlining function of human tissues, and engineering products for all these categories, are almost entirely students of the biological group of sciences. They are missing a fluency in mathematics, or physics, engineering, human movement science, kinetics, and kinematics. Because of the very unique way we have compartmentalized our education system -(and I would probably interject here too, it's not really a compartmentalization, necessarily, of an education system. But probably greater of a knowledge system. And the education system is going to reflect how we've kind of put parameters around what is defined as what. And I'll read that sentence again from the very beginning.) \xa0Because of the very unique way we have compartmentalized our education system we have segmented “life science” from “things in the universe” science, meaning the average healthcare scientist (keep in mind this is a very, VERY educated person) has minimal comprehension of how flow, pressure, force, electricity, heat, and energy (just to name a few) might affect cellular processes. All forces in the universe impact cellular processes, just like pharmaceuticals do. Not knowing these other, non-biological sciences places a limitation on our ability to figure out possible causes and solutions to ailments. We dynamic creatures are entire universes of physical matter, subject to physical laws, suffering the biological consequences when, frankly, we don’t know how to operate."", 'Enter biomechanics (do you hear angels singing? I know I do!), an academic option that requires all of the sciences above. That explores how the human body works under the physical laws. And when you know all of the information, (and keep in mind this is Katy from 2018 going - and there is no knowing all the information) the optimal level of health and beyond (what most of us like to call WELLNESS) is attainable. And I’m happy to see that at least one major university is beginning to offer a Medical Biomechanics option, where graduates are required to know ALL of the sciences that govern the human body, instead of half of them. I want the person in charge of my body to know a hundred percent of the science.', 'Oh wait. I’m the person in charge of my body. And you are the person in charge of your body. And the time has come to no longer hand off your health to someone you see five times a year. It is time to become an expert in human science, or at least your own personal body, because, well, you’re all you really have.', 'And, P.S., you already know a lot more physics than your high school experience led you to believe. You are a Master of the Universe. You’ve got your physics down, really, it just needs to be brought to the front of your mind.', 'It’s getting to be that time on Mother Nature’s watch. Indian summer winds down and the winds kick up. And I just realized right now that wind (like a clock) and wind (like blowing in a storm) are spelled the same way. Which is tripping me up and making me lose my train of thought.', 'I flew home through a thunder and lightning storm last week. Thunder and lightning in California. In L.A., if you can imagine. And it was awesome, once I was no longer flying through it. I haven’t noticed a large population of sick people yet, but as winter weather starts to develop, colds tend to develop too. Which is why I thought it would be fun to talk about your immune system today.', 'What is this “immune system,” anyway? If I had about thirty hours and the ability to type ten thousand words I could tell you, but frankly, I have to do laundry. So, to simplify, your immune system is all of the organs and actions that go into protecting you from the super-tiny, almost invisible things in your environment. There are a lot of things that can weaken this system, including: poor sleeping habits, and alcohol consumption, and stress, high-intensity exercise sometimes, and poor nutrition.', ""There's also one major mechanical component to a well-functioning immune system. And no, it’s not wearing that necklace from Survivor. The superhero of health this season is your lymphatic system. The fluid in this system, lymph, is the worker bee of your immune response. And when this fluid fails to circulate, the body has a decreased ability to fight off various ailments."", 'And “Circulate” is the key word here. The word implies movement, and a lot of it.', 'And here’s the deal with lymph. It doesn’t move very well on its own. It doesn’t have a great pump like your heart, so the less you move your muscles, the more your lymph resembles scuzzy pond water.', ""(And I'm gonna jump in here to say just to explain a little bit more, the vessels of your lymphatic system are put within your muscular tissue and between, like around your muscular tissue. Everything's packed so tightly. It has a little bit of force production on its own but very very little. It is primarily dependent on the muscular action. The musculoskeletal action to move it. It's motility, if you're not considering the musculoskeletal system, the motility of the lymphatic system, which is the movement of the fluid, is very low. So this is why I bring this essay to this series of three, because the way we have defined our systems, it is not a natural take away that the performance of your immune system relates to any other system. So your musculoskeletal system, if its operation is really essentially part of the anatomy of an immune system then talking about them separately, having separate experts in each that have little cross over into each other's system makes it very challenging to formulate hypothesis and tests and questions and models that aren't missing a huge piece. And so I love movement and I'm always questioning the lack of movement or physical sciences in a lot of what we've put under the heading of biological sciences because I do think it is directly involved in why we are where we are with our understanding of how to take care of our own bodies. \xa0Ok, we'll go back to the book.)"", ""Another deal with circulation is you have to move all of your muscles in their ranges of motion to get the lymph to move. When your muscles are tight, limiting the motion of a joint, the lymph tends to back up in that area. And here's some not-so-great news: Your largest lymph node clusters are at located at the areas we tend to be tightest—the neck, the armpits and chest, the groin, and in between the ribs."", '(And I\'m going to jump back in here, KB 2018, and say I frame it as not so great news. \xa0One thing that I think is important to point out here is the cluster of lymphatic nodes are fortunately located in these areas because these are the areas that have the potential for the greatest amount of motion. And so this is kind of what mismatched theory is all about. What we have in an anatomy that is heavily dependent on movement to get a full operation out of its tissues, out of its systems. In the modern world, these areas that have the greatest capacity for motion, therefore where your immune system is fortunately situated so that you get basically immune support by moving, it\'s relatively much more strenuous on the immune system to not be moving because they\'re located where they are. If they were located in areas of lower motion it wouldn\'t be such a strain. So that\'s what mismatchedh theory is - your immune system is dependent on motion at these large joints and we don\'t have it. And we actually have not just no motion we\'ve got restricted motion. So if you decide that you want to go move, that motion is not really even available to us without doing some serious restoration. And so I just like to edit the idea that ""oh what a terrible design we have here"" where we\'ve got our nodes here when really it\'s the other way around. So anyway, back to the article.)', 'The good news is this month’s Martha Stewart’s Whole Living magazine has a feature with ', ', designed to improve the mechanics of your lymphatic system.

You should have the shape of an arch in your feet, yes, but if you cut your feet open, there's no fixed anatomical part that's shaped like an arch. The shape of the arch is created by healthy tone in the many muscles and tissues of the feet, that pull bones here and there until the arch is intact. So, no arches?

We\'ve kind of - I\'ve always made it about your health or your movement. I mean you can take these series of questions and do it for anything. You can just do it for remembering 2017.

I have a picture of you loitering on Facebook, like, if Facebook had a corner you'd be in like leaning up against it. Like I'm not lurking around. I'm not loitering. I'm getting in, I'm getting out.

You know I had done a long one the year before but the thought of having it... and you recover from a long one the next day - you definitely feel it - so the idea of waking up and to do another long one the second day...', 'DANI : What was that like? Waking up and thinking... I mean how did you....what was going on in your head?', ""KATY: Well, the first year I did 30... I think I ended up doing something like 36 miles, 36 or 37 miles in one day and I had that ankle that just wasn't aligned very well and so I beat it up. To the point, I think I might have even given myself a precursor to a stress fracture. I don't know if there's an actual stress fracture but there was definitely some swelling."", 'DANI: Mm-hmm.', 'KATY; And so I wasn\'t walking really well the next day and it took a few days for things to smooth out. And that ankle kind of bugged me for a good couple of months. But I sorted out what the issue was. I sorted out the issue of the shoes and the movements that my ankle was and wasn\'t capable of doing and I fixed that. So the next time I had no foot issues at all, either day. So it wasn\'t actually a big deal at all. It was a mental game. It was a problem with me mentally because I was like, ""What\'s it gonna be like to get up the next day?"" because of the year before. But because I did my leg work, point wink, it wasn\'t even an issue.', ""DANI: That's cool."", 'KATY: I just got up. And the first day was freezing rain. So it was about 17 miles the first day and then the second day was close to 30. So yeah...', ""DANI: Wow. That's awesome."", 'KATY: \xa0It was fine. Yeah.', 'DANI: I hope to get to go on one of those with you sometime.', ""KATY: I'm gonna do another one. March 4th's coming up.

Wasn't it I was going to walk 2017 miles or something like that."", ""KATY: I don't know."", ""DANI: I can't remember. \xa0I didn't look at my answers this year. That is so weird.

You did a chin up!', ""DANI: Good job Philip! \xa0Let's move forward away from that."", ""KATY: \xa0You're like now be quiet. \xa0Ok. What was the smartest health or movement decision you made in 2017?"", 'DANI: Oh that one is easy because it\'s been an interesting year for health for me. I got a new dog. I have one old dog and one cold dog - doesn\'t like to go out in the cold in the morning. So I got another dog who has to walk. He just has this kind of energy and he has to go and move like seriously every day. And so because my schedule changed with working 40 hours a week, I was always an early riser anyway but now I have to get up. He makes me walk every morning. So even though I have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, I do it because this dog needs it so badly. I need it. But I would find a way with this new schedule to kind of be like, ""I\'m too tired. I don\'t have time."" \xa0It\'s extra early but he makes me do it so good one on ya Rubin.', 'KATY: That\'s actually a great strategy for parents or anyone who is like, ""How can I get my partner or my kids to move more?"" It\'s like act like a dog. Like just every morning go into their room at 5 am and start poking your nose into them and be just like whining...', 'DANI: Chew up their stuff and...', 'KATY: A little whining and just arf arf... just make it so uncomfortable to not go with you that they\'re like, ""Fine.""', ""DANI: Yeah it would be detrimental if I didn't walk this dog every day."", ""KATY: Make it detrimental if they don't go with you. Chew up their stuff."", 'DANI: What about you?', 'KATY: You will love this. And I think just you alone can super appreciate it. I came up with and actually set in motion a new book.', 'DANI: Oh my gosh.', 'KATY: And then I canceled it.', 'DANI: HUH? \xa0What?', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'DANI: Wow.', 'KATY; Yeah. I\'m still writing the book. This was an extra book. This was a hail Mary in before like right before 2017 was over I was like ""oh my gosh and another thing it\'s gonna be so great and it\'s gonna be so easy..."" \xa0And I just got it in and I pushed it through, you know, and then I just, I saw my own behavior and I canceled it.', ""DANI: That's pretty good."", ""KATY: This just happened within 48 hours. It's within 48 hours that I made this in 2017 improve my health decision. \xa0"", 'DANI: How do you feel about that decision?', 'KATY: Fantastic.', 'DANI: Good for you.', 'KATY: Fantastic. And then my husband was like ""good decision."" And I was like, ""Why didn\'t you say that as I was ramping it up?"" \xa0He\'s like, ""because no one can tell you what to do. You have to do it."" I was like, ""Oh yeah.""', ""DANI: Yeah. I'm really proud of you."", ""KATY: Cancelled a book. Thank you. I'm proud of myself as well. And it's not that I'm not gonna do it. It's just that I'm not gonna do it now in a way that makes stress or chaos the momentum for my work."", 'DANI: Mmm.', ""KATY: Like I'm gonna actually have to become less lazy and manifest my creativity in a different way."", ""DANI: Wow. That's pretty cool."", ""KATY: And it's going to have to be ... yeah, so we'll see. It could be that this book never gets written now, but whatever. \xa0Ok, well... what single word best sums up your 2017 health or movement experience?"", ""DANI: Ok, I'd like to say the single word but my answers that are coming after will explain it. So don't make me explain this word, ok?"", 'KATY: Ok. Ok.', 'DANI: \xa0My one word that best sums up this 2017 health experience is ""confounding."" Go.', ""KATY: I don't even want you to explain it. \xa0Well, mine I could say something similar to mine but it's essentially grieving."", 'DANI: Wow. \xa0Are you not...are you gonna not... ok.', 'KATY: I thought it was ""you\'re not gonna live right, I\'m not gonna..."" \xa0And actually, it\'s interesting some of my subsequent questions will also explain it, essentially...', ""DANI: Ok, yeah. I'm cool."", ""KATY: Let's do it. Let's let it happen naturally. \xa0Ok. Greatest lesson you learned about health in 2017?"", "" DANI: Ok, so this is part of the explanation and I know that you've said this and I've said it but when you live it, it's kind of like your husband kind of not being able to tell you to not write the book. You have to figure stuff out. Sometimes on a cellular level. My greatest lesson was you cannot bank health."", 'KATY: Yeah.', 'DANI: Dang-it!', ""KATY: \xa0That's so true."", ""DANI: You cannot do it. I just think for the last, what, 7, 8 years since I've been doing your work? That's really all I've been doing, is just you know getting to a much better spot. And I was but then with this new gig I had to let some of that fall off and I got into some old patterns and it was just weird to have some stuff that I had shrugged off 8 years ago come back because of old movement patterns."", 'KATY: Wow.', ""DANI: You're just never over, you're never to a place I think where you can sit back and loiter in the corner. I mean it's always an active thought and motion towards your health."", ""KATY: Yes. And I think that that - that's so profound because that is one of my big issues with movement as therapy or movement as medicine versus movement as nutrition."", 'DANI: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: Because nutrition is: hey these things go away from adding these in to your daily diet forever and ever because if they're not there the same issue arises and so many people are struggling to fix their physical structures through a short bout of therapy and then when they don't see things get better, or get better but then come back to where they were once they've, not stopped with the inputs. Then they think that there was an issue with the therapy rather than going this is just like nutrition. You have to keep doing it."", ""DANI: Yeah. You can't just eat vitamin c one time. It just doesn't work that way."", 'KATY: No no.', 'DANI: And I know that but to actually see it happen. It was like oh wow.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""DANI: She does know what she's talking about."", 'KATY: Well like, you get it. Awesome.', ""DANI: Yeah, it's real."", 'KATY: Ok are you ready for mine?', 'DANI: Yes.', 'KATY: This is the greatest health. This is the greatest lesson. And I think it\'s, you could say it\'s about health, it\'s really for me about everything but since everything is the environment for my physical structure and my mental structure then this is what I learned. It\'s a flowchart. It\'s a flowchart I saw in a presentation. The flow chart was ""Do you have a problem? No? Then why are you worrying?"" \xa0""Do you have a problem. Yes? \xa0Can you do something about it? Yes? Then why are you worrying?"" and ""Do you have a problem? \xa0Yes? Can you do anything about it? \xa0No? \xa0Then why are you worrying?""', 'DANI: Mmm.', ""KATY: And it just, I don't know why. \xa0Maybe I like geeky diagrams but it basically helped me see the difference between taking action to solve something and expressing or expending a lot of personal worry or internal negativity and having constant turmoil and mistaking that for taking action. "", 'DANI: Right.', 'KATY: Like the thinking about it and ruminating on it was, in fact, improving the situation when it doesn\'t, wasn\'t impacting the situation at all, much to my own physical detriment. So now I have just really come to see deep-seated discontent as a separate issue from what\'s going on externally and I know that that\'s probably the foundational tenant for a lot of ways people are pursuing their lives but for me I just needed this flowchart and I was like, ""Oh, this part doesn\'t have to be tied to working towards improving the situation."" So...', 'DANI: Right.', 'KATY: ...that was powerful for me.', ""DANI: That's good. I'm happy for you."", ""KATY: I feel like I used to really know that but it kind of faded like the more you know then you're like, Oh my gosh and then..."", 'DANI: Well the world is always changing though.', 'KATY: Sure. Sure.', 'DANI: I saw a quote years ago, like 4 years ago, that said, ""Worry has never fixed anything."" And I just like, it just hit me. It\'s like, ""huh, yeah, you know action cures fears."" \xa0It is a huge energy suck internally.', ""KATY: Well especially if you're not processing what you're going to do about it."", 'DANI: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: You know what I mean? If you're just..."", 'DANI: Right.', 'KATY: \xa0I was just like ""Ok wait stop. Hold On. \xa0What action were you proposing?""', ""DANI: Right. That's awesome."", 'KATY: And also verbalizing. In the beginning of Movement Matters, I had heard Ashley Judd say to point out an issue without simultaneously proposing a solution was a particular form of, I don\'t know what she called it if it was abuse or whatever. But I was like, oh ok. So then when I have that feeling of like ""Oh I don\'t want to change this."" Ok well then sit down. What\'s the action that I propose. And then the negativity that I feel about it is converted into the steps that I think would solve it. I don\'t know. It\'s just been helpful for me personally.', 'DANI: Excellent. That is good.', 'KATY: Ok. Most loving service you performed in 2017.', 'DANI: Ok. That was just being really present and loving and patient with two teenagers. Because it requires, and you will see, ', 'KATY: I know.', 'DANI: ...it requires a lot of love and fortunately, I remember what it was like to be a teenager. Like it really hasn\'t left my head at all. It\'s a little bit easier for me to remember and understand what\'s going on but it can really be rough on you as a parent no matter how awesome your kids are. Because it\'s just part of the natural human progression. I mean I think at this point the things they go through as teenagers is really nature\'s way of helping us let go of them because up until they became teenagers I would look at them every day and think, ""I love their little faces so much. How will I ever live without them? I love you. Oh no, I\'ll die if they move away."" \xa0Then they hit teenagers and you\'re like, ""Yep, it\'s ok.""', ""KATY: I'm ready. I'm good."", 'DANI: You can go and I\'ll live without you. \xa0I really think that\'s the progression. It\'s just nature\'s way of holding our hand and saying ""you\'ll be fine.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'DANI: That is it. That is, I think because it requires a lot of love. And a lot of presence. \xa0', 'KATY: Are they aware of your love and presence?', 'DANI: \xa0That\'s the thing. Is even when they\'re saying ""get away"" you kind of just have to be there anyway.', ""KATY: Oh... you know this is just hearing that it doesn't change my answer. My answer is the same but I see my answer in a different way. So for me, it was, I'm gonna cry. If I cry just go with it. \xa0It was midwifing the death basically of my father."", 'DANI: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: And it's the same, for me, you know especially coming from so much work in the birth in the first few moments of a life coming in, you know, and all the different ways that that can be and then to see basically the bookend of that is not something that a lot of people have experienced. \xa0I certainly, maybe people listening to this podcast there are certainly plenty of people all around the world who have been in that role multiple times but it's kind of something that in our culture isn't as prevalent. And it was like an at home death. It was like a bookend of what you call what you'd consider a home birth. So it was a non-medicalized home death. Very peaceful, but having all of these same movements of tremendous love or space for basically the experience that the person was going to have and to observe it and to be there to respond to it but to not direct it with how I felt it should go. You know what I mean?"", 'DANI: Yeah.', 'KATY: So it\'s like a cycle. \xa0You have a kid and you\'re like, ""oh, this is what love is."" \xa0And then you have a teenager and then you\'re like, ""No THIS is what love is"". And then to become the adult child, as a parent...', 'DANI: Oh wow.', 'KATY: ...you\'re like, ""Oh, this, this is ... THIS is what love is."" \xa0And it\'s all like that.', 'DANI: I know. So many phases.', ""KATY: It's all the phases of it and you get the full picture of the capacity for it by moving through all of the phases.

Well, I\'m gonna have to say the pull-up. This is 3 years running. It\'s just OH, I have to talk to Philip because I find it so dreary to work on it. It\'s just not... I have to make it interesting. Well, I found out this spring that I was trying to do a pull-up and that starting with a chin-up was easier? \xa0Is that true? Because I was showing somebody what I was doing and she was like, ""Oh, well try it underhand. And that\'s easier."" \xa0So that was one thing that I did change. But I didn\'t complete that and I didn\'t work that hard on it. So that explains why I didn\'t complete it.', 'KATY: \xa0This is no mystery.', ""DANI: I didn't worry about it though so that's good."", 'KATY: There you go.', ""DANI: Also I had set out to walk and document on Instagram my 2017 miles and I stopped, the same time I got my job, so my available hours kind of shifted to walk that amount of time every day. So it had to be 5 and a half miles, seven days a week to make that happen. So that shifted, the available time. And then also I stopped documenting. So I still was walking every day, just not that huge amount. Who knows. Maybe some day I'll achieve it, but maybe not. But that's unfinished for me. Did not complete it. And I'm usually pretty good about completing those big things like that."", 'KATY: \xa0Well we all have to have a mountain.', ""DANI: Yes. How about you? What's your unfinished health business?"", ""KATY: Well, I was kind of looking back at last year and I didn't give up coffee. \xa0Like not like, I didn't even come close to it. I didn't even try.

I'd like to thank coffee too."", 'KATY: And all of the people and labor that goes into it.', 'DANI: Yes. Thank you.', ""KATY: I mean it's not even the coffee. It's that this life's work..."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: ... I'm so grateful to it. \xa0And I know that changing my relationship with it is in the future and it's always conscious as I'm participating in that cycle and I'm going to be grateful for it and also continue to strive to deal with my own heavy preferences, right? That I'm unable to negotiate."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: Like that's always a personal effort that I'm trying to make. So coffee, you're on the list. So... what about your health or movement that you're most happy about completing in 2017."", ""DANI: Ok. So this isn't huge but it kind of was for me. So I stopped dying my hair, right? I think before the end of 2016. Like I made this decision to do this. And then it took until late this summer to have all the dye job grown out. I think it's just growing out the dye job and letting that white and silver show has been awesome for me. I have dyed my hair kind of reddish for 20 some years and then once I let my hair grow out I realized I did not look good as a redhead. Like my natural color, the color I was born with, made my skin look the best, and most glowy, and I just, I look younger. Even though I have grey hair, I look younger in my opinion."", ""KATY: I just saw you. You do! \xa0It's like your skin..."", ""DANI: I know it's so weird."", ""KATY: \xa0That's the color your skin is supposed to lay against your hair sort of warm and glowy."", 'DANI: Exactly. Had I, you know, woulda, shoulda, coulda. But I\'m so happy I did it now and people said, ""Oh you should color it so you don\'t have any transition"" and you know last year you were like, ""There\'s no ugly transition, it\'s just transition.""', 'KATY: Right.', 'DANI: So I just let it be a transition. I took pictures. I enjoyed every minute of it. I never once was like, ""Aaaah!"" \xa0I was just present and loved it and now I\'m so happy I did it. I loved it. That was my big big thing. Because it wasn\'t really so much, yeah it\'s physical health because you\'re not coloring your hair and you\'re not buying all these chemicals and stuff but at the same time...', ""KATY: And also you're more comfortable with who you are. Accepting."", 'DANI: Yeah. Yeah. \xa0How about you? \xa0What was your - what are you most happy about completing?', 'KATY: \xa0When I was reading that question I was like does that mean like thank goodness this is over or like... or just the fact that you made it through?', 'DANI: I did it!', ""KATY: I think it was just two months of basically living out of a suitcase with two small kids or two young kids. I mean they're 5 and 6 so they're not toddlers anymore. So yeah, two months of uncomfortable living. Like in single...it wasn't hotels. I mean sometimes it was tents. Sometimes it was a small studio apartment, you know, and just being completely, because we went out of the country. So just that. \xa0And it was uncomfortable and I don't mean unpleasant. The discomfort was planned and welcome."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: But I am glad that I completed it. Like as a family unit we negotiated tiny living without very many of our comforts. Although will full acknowledgment that we are heavily comforted all the time even when we're going without our comforts. But just being slightly outside of this comfort zone and the awareness that it brings. So I was glad to make it through that. \xa0And be back home now. We just got back so it's just kind of still...two weeks today."", 'DANI: Oh cool.', ""KATY: So yeah. I'm glad we did it. I'm glad it's over. And I'm glad we did it. And we might do it again."", 'DANI: Oh good!', 'KATY: Who are the three people that had the greatest impact on your health 2017? Or your movement.', 'DANI: \xa0Ok. \xa0Yes. \xa0So my daughter and my son and my father-in-law. And I will tell you why. My daughter she just has listened when I have been always be like, ""keep the edges of your feet straight."" Like she listened about that stuff. So watching her transition that way and grow up with that kind of stuff under her belt has been really good for me and not just a pat on the back but also just like ""keep doing what you\'re doing for yourself."" BEcause you can see the difference it\'s making for her. So that was good. \xa0My son, who actually can do many pull-ups, like he set out to do them and he\'s so driven that now he\'s just all lean and muscle-y and can do many pull-ups over and over again. I\'m gonna ask him to actually coach me in my pull up adventures. And my father-in-law because he got really sick. He\'s 84 and has always been in very good mental and physical health. Always taking care of himself, always moved all the time. And he got pancreatic cancer and he was supposed to be dead already but because of his mental and physical attitude and some great surgery, he is still alive and it just, it\'s good to look at him. I was with him in Mexico last month and he wanted to go ride ATVs through the jungle and he had just gotten out of cancer surgery two months before. For me, just seeing that mental attitude of, just let\'s keep doing stuff. Let\'s keep moving, is good for me. So he\'s been very inspiring to watch. Who are your three people?', ""KATY: \xa0Well, I'm thinking again because it's again it's like a bookend to your answer where we're just on the same page. I talked earlier that grief was my word for this year and that's because I lost three people within six weeks, I think. So, my father passed away who was almost 90, just to kind of get a sense of the spectrum of the experience, right?"", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: So there's a spectrum, definitely. So it was my father who was 90. My best friend who was 50, who had cancer. And then the other, he's not my father-in-law but he's my sister's father-in-law, the other family patriarch who, was still... he moved into living off of the land like some time just living in a teepee or cloth shelter..."", 'DANI: Oh wow.', 'KATY: ... when he was in his 40s and was still, I think he was 87 or 88. He and my dad were very similar in age. And they all three passed away within six weeks and they all had different elements that really impacted my health in the way that how I was afterward. Not just that they impacted it during their process because I was so integral with the process with at least a couple of them, but just in the understanding that came after the fact of, you know, my dad who was 90. He was taking supplements when he was 30. His mother, my grandmother, was like a super health nut, kind of back in the 60s and 70s. He took 12 supplements a day and he exercised every single day and he had, what we on all perceptions, to be a very stressful life. He was an air traffic controller...', 'DANI: Oh wow.', 'KATY:... the most stressful job, I think, statistically. Smoker. Also a crop duster in the DDT era...', 'DANI: Oh my gosh.', ""KATY: ... open cockpit, DDT, for decades. \xa0I don't think he smoked while he spraying DDT but I'm not sure that he wasn't. \xa0And then 10 kids. So it's like as far as like all of the things that we would say are hyper-stressful..."", 'DANI: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: ... he had them all but he was just a lighthearted, generous, funny, positive person. Who did not worry. And even when he was at the point when he was landing airplanes and dealing with catastrophes and stuff, he didn't have a lot of negative processing and turmoil. He was just fixing the problems as they came in and he did not have an issue with that inner voice or whatever. He just didn't have that."", ""DANI: That's awesome."", 'KATY: Yeah. And like someone really choosing to be like, ""I\'m good. Here we go."" And then you know to someone who has cancer and is not really to go but who is accepting going through this period of acceptance. So I just, after this year, I just want to recognize the gift that every minute is and everything that I do, I\'m just, ""Is this the most authentic version of what I want to be doing."" What I would actually say is a way that I behave. So it\'s been a way to calibrate my own behavior, my own thoughts, the way I prioritize things. So, they impacted me in 2017, but definitely also going forward. It\'s just a huge perspective to have so much transition in a short period of time of lots of different types so I\'m definitely grateful for this year.', ""DANI: Mmm. \xa0Yeah, it's been kind of an intense year."", ""KATY: Yeah. But at the same time, so I'm gonna give my answer for the greatest health risk and I'll ask you after.\xa0"", 'DANI: Ok.', ""KATY: It's related because there was so much travel involved. My dad was here with me but my friend wasn't and my brother died too within...this is just so much personal information ... but within also the year. About 7 months before my dad. So I think I counted and it was 36 flights."", 'DANI: Wow!', ""KATY: Within 12 months and that wasn't even for only, like for work. I might have left some work ones out of there."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: And it was just like. I feel so - I know people travel professionally, especially on planes. But it was risky. It was taxing for sure. And I don't know if that's what they mean by the question but I felt like it was risky to do that much, not the flying, but it's three hours to an airport from here and just the standing and the driving around."", 'DANI: Oh sure.', 'KATY: It was just... and I would have easily done it again, but it was taxing. \xa0What about you?', 'DANI: And I think that question could be interpreted however you want. I think before I\'ve taken it to mean ""Ooh what exciting thing did you do that was scary?""', 'KATY: Right right.', ""DANI: But this year I interpreted it the same way as you, like something that was really taxing on my health and it was getting a full-time job. \xa0Because I have worked from home and kind of kept my own schedule for the last, what, 15 or so 20 years. And having to be somewhere for a time, at a time, has been really intense. And I'm fortunate in that my job is so varied like I'm never sitting for any period of time. I have a standing workstation. I can have all my gear there and my rock trays and my calf stretch and wear what I want so I don't have to. I can't go barefoot. But, you know, just wear what I want because it's casual. So that part's been cool but it's just, it's been huge getting text neck from being at my computer too long or holding a phone between my shoulder and my head, you know, when I'm in my office.and so that's been really intense. \xa0And why it is intense, I think, is because you don't realize how, I didn't, how much your old patterns related to your stress can come into things."", 'KATY: Mmm.', ""DANI: You know, I think I'm good at my job and it's exciting and creative and varied and I'm never bored. But when the pressure comes in, I started getting lower back pain. I'm like, why? My back hasn't hurt in 8 years since I started doing Katy's stuff. What is the deal? \xa0But I was tucking my pelvis. My psoas was shortening in response to the stress. And it wasn't anything that was precipitated by conscious thought. It was just a natural regular human reaction. So my body was following suit and all of these problems that I had gotten rid of ... That's why I said you can't bank health. And that's part of why it was so confounding for my one word. Because it's like, wow all these things I'd gotten away from but a month and a half of doing something stressful, or high pressure, and you fall back into those patterns that we'd so very carefully thought we'd trained ourselves out of. Constant vigilance. \xa0\xa0That was a long answer, huh?"", ""KATY: Well, you were explaining another one. And I think, too, for the people listening\xa0you know, I think there is, there's always two things going on. When you start to move differently or hold yourself differently it's easy to do that within the space of an exercise class or exercise time because that's what you're doing. So it's hard to delineate what is beneficial. Is it the physical adjustment of the body? Or is it the awareness - is it the fact that you're clued into your body. That you're paying attention to your body."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: So there's two things going on that are beneficial and they might both be necessary. So as we try to figure out how to move differently within a life that we're not changing much of the environment, we're just trying to change how we behave within it, we might have some of the position down but we don't have some of the intention down."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: Right? So. That's what we call stress. Or things that are distracting us or taking us away from paying attention to all parts of ourselves."", 'DANI: Mmm.', ""KATY: So I find delineation of things very interesting because we tend to see the benefit of what is most easily seen and measured, like pelvic tilt and root position. The things that you can't see are the things that are almost impossible to measure and I think are going to stay outside of the arena of scientific knowledge for a long time for that reason that you can't measure the health benefits of having the space to listen or pay attention to your own body."", 'DANI: Yes.', 'KATY: So how do you... so that seems to be necessary. But I don\'t know how you quantify it to the point where it actually is given a weighted value to go, ""No really, you might want to..."" \xa0Just in the way that we would make space for all sorts of dietary, even mechanical nutrients because we\'ve can distribute them and see them so yes, get your desk set up so that you have the healthy food in the kitchen and your ergonomics just right but that other things, like maybe you need space to not have to operate inside this box all the time is going to take a while to come back in. So...', 'DANI: Yes.', 'KATY: Anyway, that was just a ramble. Sorry. Ramble on! \xa0Ok, biggest health surprise in 2017? And it better be a pull-up!', ""DANI: \xa0HA! \xa0It wasn't...it isn't even a fun surprise. Like if this jumped out of a cake at me, I would send the cake back. I got diverticulitis."", 'KATY: Oh my goodness!', ""DANI: I know. And it was so...that's where the other part of the confounding... it's like what? And I was reading up on it and the way to prevent it is like a high fiber diet and regular exercise and that has been my life. I have been concerned about fiber and my digestion since I was like 12. So it..."", 'KATY: Wow!', 'DANI: When I told my husband that he was like, ""You\'re the most high fiber person I know."" \xa0So that was weird. And then I was reading that 10% of people over 40 have it. That\'s a huge statistic, I think. So that was confounding. It was like, ""Well, I\'ve done all this stuff that I thought was right and was feeling right."" And how that happened... and it\'s a recent diagnosis so I\'m still kind of just like grappling with that. Surprise. How about you?', ""KATY: Wow. I'm sorry to hear that. For me, what was my biggest health surprise? This one feels like a different type of interpretation of the question. For me, it was playing with my sleep in a different way that, like I'm often tired especially when the sun goes down, like to go to bed at 7:30 with my kids is what feels most natural. But that when I do, I wake up at like 3 perfectly wide awake and I can actually be awake from that time on. Or, if I just really really pay attention to how I feel, then I can be up from 3-5 and then go back to bed from 5 until 6:30 or 7. And have, like I've been playing with that - like that one just seems so wrong to me. Like, oh my gosh, I have to get all this sleep and I have to get back to bed but I've just found that this is this natural rhythm that I have at this time of my life and this season ... at this age. \xa0And it's been fantastic to go wow, I have 3 to 5 am as like quiet, middle of the night time for me to do a lot of those things for myself that I don't normally get a chance to do. Read. \xa0Make a really gorgeous cup of tea and curl up with a blanket. I'm getting my self-care in the middle of the night and it's not like I'm dragging myself awake."", 'DANI: Right.', 'KATY: Like tuning in to that biorhythm is amazing.', ""DANI: That's really cool. We've talked about "", "" before that I really liked. It was about a guy that lived among a tribe of the Amazon. And he would talk about how they would get up at 1 in the morning. They go to bed as soon as the sun went down and then they would get up and they would sit around and eat and chat a little bit for a few hours and kind of just be - have it like a gentle time and then go back to bed. \xa0And that was really, for them, the natural way of their sleep pattern. And it wasn't unusual. It was part of the culture."", ""KATY: Well yeah, I wonder if it's just..."", 'DANI: That might be the way that humans originally ...', ""KATY: Or that's how humans behave within this environment that's got a lot of movement, a lot of temperature variation."", 'DANI: Right. Who knows.', ""KATY: Well there's all this kind of stuff about plants and how they're measuring circadian rhythms and how we're measuring it and all the interference that we have in the way that we measure circadian rhythms and it's no wonder sleep is so therapeutic because it might be completely off. Like in the way that nutrition could be off, there's these elements that you're missing, things you're getting too much on. That sleep has that capacity for so many people to be a solution."", 'DANI: Yeah.', ""KATY: What's "", '? Do you remember what the book is called?', 'DANI: I think we even have it in one of the notes of the ', "". I can't even remember."", ""KATY: Let's add it. We'll add it to the show notes."", ""DANI: It's in one of our "", '.', 'KATY: Ok, what important relationship improved most this last year.', 'DANI: Mm. \xa0Ok, so this goes back to two questions ago where you talked about giving yourself the space to figure out what\'s going on. For me, it\'s my understanding of those innate responses to situations that were high pressure or stress. And pretty much my breath being in tune with that. And so, yes I fell into old patterns of movement, how my body responded. But because of how I\'ve been living the last eight years I was able to key into it right away. It wasn\'t a mystery what was happening. \xa0It was like, ""Oh, that\'s what I\'m doing."" \xa0And so immediately I wanted to tune in to that and give that space to not happen. So that\'s been really cool. I\'ve just been able to feel things happening. Like, oh, my head\'s sliding forward. \xa0And that\'s why I\'ve got a headache for the first time in seven years, or whatever. What\'s going on in my mind, like emotionally, that makes that happen. Am I just not paying attention? Am I feeling under pressure? \xa0What is it? Like I feel like I have this bigger toolkit to not just position myself correctly but to pay attention to what precipitated that? What made that happen? How do I deal with it?', ""KATY: I like that. So basically your relationship improved with yourself which is a ... I had a similar answer which is the relationship that improved for me the most this year was the one between me and the voice in my head. That is not me. \xa0And so I just keep saying that the stuff that you hear, that's not you. It's you are the person watching or listening or observing that voice in your head. So for me keeping those two separate has been very, very helpful."", 'DANI: Mm. \xa0', ""KATY: Compliment that you would have like to receive but didn't? "", 'DANI: \xa0Um. You smell like campfire smoke.', 'KATY: \xa0(laughs) \xa0Oh!', ""KATY: So here's the thing: So I tried to write a few of them but most of them just came out, like I couldn't phrase them in a way that was positive. They all felt negative to me so I didn't answer it."", ""DANI: That's a tough one. In fact, when I was reading that it's like, you know, we should maybe squeeze in there what compliment did you receive that you ... or something."", ""KATY: Well that's what I... I abstained from answering this because to force me to answer it is to force me to kind of muster negativity and I don't need to do that. So I left it blank."", 'DANI: Yeah.', 'KATY: Take that!', 'DANI: Well my other one was ""What an incredible pull-up."" \xa0No, that kind of bums me out.', ""KATY: And again, it's like self-deprecating. "", ""DANI: Yes, well let's just change that."", ' \xa0', 'DANI: Ok.', ""KATY: That's the whole point. You're not going to be able to eliminate the negativity but you don't have to engage in it. \xa0Ok, what compliment would you have like to have given. To gave?"", 'DANI: \xa0You sure know how to put up a tent! That goes back to my ""I just was not outside enough"".', ""KATY: Yeah. Well, you're outside the amount that you could be this year. \xa0What..."", 'DANI: Wait, did you answer that? Or are you skipping that one too? You can skip it.', ""KATY: I'm skipping it. Because I feel like ... if I recognize right now that I didn't give a compliment I'm gonna go give it. I don't need to fill it in as a question on a podcast."", 'DANI: Got it.', 'KATY: What else do you need to do or say to be complete with 2017.', 'DANI: Ok, this is one always confounds me.', 'KATY: Confounding is a big word for you.', ""DANI: It's a big one."", 'KATY: I just have a picture of your loitering confused somewhere on Facebook.', ""DANI: But confounded is different. Because you're just like how did this happen. "", 'KATY: Right.', 'DANI: \xa0So I would say for me it\'s just like, ""Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep..."" It\'s like this journey you just have to keep doing one foot in front of the other no matter what happens. Because you\'re never gonna be complete. You\'re never gonna reach the peak. And it\'s this journey and you just keep on going.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'DANI: How about you?', ""KATY: For me, it's do your own work. Do your work and I'll do mine."", ""KATY: Ok, we're gonna have to go faster through these. Because we've loitered. We've loitered a long time. So good news 2018."", 'DANI: \xa0I think I know who the loiterer is. But go ahead.', ""KATY: \xa0I'm gonna get into facebook. I'm just confounded."", 'DANI : What?', 'KATY: Ok, what would you like your biggest health triumph in 2018 to be?', 'DANI: Pull up!', 'KATY: Such problem answer. I think we should just give like ""C"" instead of just pull up for everything.', 'DANI: Yeah!', ""KATY: \xa0For me, I am planning a monthly twenty-mile walk as a treat for myself.

I got it. Keep up the water drinking. That's been good. \xa0Stay away from sugar, also good. And go back to meditating. Because I let that fall off my radar. "", ""KATY: What's that?"", 'DANI: I was doing so well with it and its huge impact for me last year and then I just was like, "" I don\'t have time for that. I\'m ok now. I\'m good"". \xa0What about you?', ""KATY: Put in the pause. \xa0Which is a bit of advice that I got from someone which is, I'm a hyper producer, again, as I talked about before. But even more, than I produce actual stuff, I produce ideas about stuff. And what happens is when I get an idea I immediately want to set it in action. But I just recognize now that it's a tactic to keep me from finishing up other things. So just putting in the pause and write down the idea and if I come back to it great and if I don't, great. It doesn't really matter. So yeah, it's just gonna continue on in that spirit."", 'DANI: Sounds good.', 'KATY: How are you gonna your movement results in 2018?', ""DANI: You mean what major effort because there's a lot of things I do to improve it but I was gonna start dance classes again?"", 'KATY: Ooh what kind?', ""DANI: Oh, African dance and hip-hop. I used to love to take dance classes before I had kids or got married and it was so much fun. So I'm gonna go back to doing that again. \xa0How about you? What major effort are you planning?"", 'KATY: To reduce my travel and air travel.', 'DANI: laughs. Why?', ""KATY: \xa0Well, yeah exactly. \xa0Well and for that reason I've been reading a lot of Wendell Berry and there's the great quote and it's like, the sentiment is, don't travel until you've slept under every single tree at your own house."", 'DANI : Mmm.', 'KATY: So I just like the spirit of that going, oh yea, there\'s so much, like it\'s not really necessary to kind of look at the stuff that I do and go ""Ok what am I intending to do here? How can I do that same thing where I am..."" so a lot of the changes that my social media break had me begin. I\'m still working through a lot of those and one of those is doing more locally. And I can set up locally. It can be USA being local compared to traveling all over the globe all of the time. I still will keep my obligations to different countries. But to not be striving for that. To being more of an inner-naut than an astronaut. \xa0It\'s the same level. It\'s the same amount of work. It\'s really the same about of reach it\'s just that the distribution of that reach is a little bit different. Reducing my air travel is the easiest way to sum that up.', 'DANI: Cool.', 'KATY: What are you trying to complete in 2018 or what would you be happy to complete?', 'DANI: Just lots of camping.', 'KATY: Mm.', 'DANI: Lots of camping trips. That would make me really happy.', ""KATY: Well we'll come out to you and maybe do one this year."", 'DANI: That sounds good.', ""KATY: I know you wanted to hike a mountain last year. You're gonna start doing some of your mountain ranges. So maybe we'll camp and hike. The two of us."", 'DANI: We could do a 14er. That would be fun.', ""KATY: That would be fun. \xa0For me, again, more of my own food production. Participating less in the current food system that has elements that I would like to see changed so I'm just changing how I do it. But just to ramp that up even more by traveling less as being part of it. \xa0What indulgence are you going to experience? What are you willing to do?"", ""DANI: What am I willing to do? I'm willing to spend money on massages. Spa facials."", ""KATY: You and I are so close in that same. So for me, it's sauna. \xa0My husband found one for me for Christmas on craigslist. Someone had built a wooden sauna and so they were selling it and "", 'DANI: Oh my gosh.', 'KATY: so we went and picked it up on a tiny little thing. So now I have, I\'m trying to make it like a community space so it\'s not just heat for one. I was like, ""Let\'s create some sort of full moon, red tent, 20 mile, conclusion ceremony and just have it on rotation so a lot of people can be well in that space.""', ""DANI: That's fun. Ooh, have fun with that!"", 'KATY: What most, what would you like to most change about your health in 2018?', 'DANI: This sounds really weird but just be alone more.', 'KATY: Oh yes.', ""DANI: I'm one of those people that I'm good with people but I really need to retreat and just kind of reset and you know I've kind of been homeschooling my kids and I'm working around 100 kids a day plus 30 staff and I just kind of need to withdraw and kind of be alone a bit more. Not just my early morning walks but just go do stuff by myself would kind of help reset me a little bit so. Focus on that. How about you? What are you going to change..what would you most like to change about your health?"", ""KATY: Well, so I'm always trying to pursue non-exercise ways of getting in those same movements that we pursue through exercise and then also trying to get that full spectrum of nutritious movement. \xa0So for me, the part that I haven't figured out how to get in a non-exercise fashion is that 20 minutes of intensity. You know where it's up like 75 or 85 percent. If I had more hills around me where I could get to that easily. For me, right now, I'd have to definitely do it in the form of exercise. So just trying to figure that out and pursue that. That's like if I was looking at my diet, that would be one of the biggest holes. That and jumping. \xa0Like power jumping. \xa0Those two would be the deficits that I would see the most. I don't see them because of the stage of my life because I imagine my nutrients are cyclic to a person, like I've said before. \xa0Within a \xa0year, within a lifetime. So I'm just looking through at how I can get more of that. Because I used to get it hauling my kids for things. But now they just can move on their own now so then I'm like, now I have to... So that's part of growing our own food. \xa0It's like ok, well then, I've been dipping my toes into permaculture. Now we need to get this food forest started and once I have more labor built back in, which also not writing a book this year will help with, then I should be back up to getting it just through hauling and digging and cutting. "", 'DANI: Awesome.', ""KATY: So but it would be nice to find a way to get it more regularly too. But then I guess it's like, just go out and labor more regularly. Problem solved. Stop being so lazy Katy. So for me, what am I looking forward to learning in 2018 was how to be alone more. So it's so interesting it's very similar to your answer above because there is this very large community. I think that... what's the poem? A universe in a raindrop. \xa0A drop in the universe, the universe in a drop. That's what it is. So I think within a community that definitely being present within a larger group of people and having a role is great but at the same time, you have a community of needs within yourself. We need things and I think there's definite alone time to get to that. My problem is I mistake the time I send everyone away to get my work done as my alone time and it isn't."", ""DANI: Mm. It's really not. I do the same thing."", 'KATY: Well because there\'s a limit. There\'s too much going on in my life for me to be well at the level I\'d like to be well. I \xa0have to let some things go. Letting some things go in 2018, 2019m 2020 is definitely on my radar going ""oh I don\'t\' have the capacity to do this without letting other things go. \xa0So for a very long time as a working mother of two children trying to be a full-time parent and also busting out 80 hours a week, my alone time is just my hyper-productive stress work time and then there\'s no, and I\'m not paying attention to myself during that time because most of my work involves meeting the needs of a hundred thousand other people. So literally my alone time is wading through. Sook, the sauna is definitely my... I read this really great sci-fi book one time about two twins...it doesn\'t really matter. Let\'s talk about sci-fi. It matters that when I go into the sauna., when I go into that space, it\'s very stacked because it is non-work alone time. It\'s creating movement passively. So I\'m trying to build that into my regular day. So we should go hang out and be alone.', 'DANI: \xa0Yeah. And not do stuff. ', 'KATY: No. What are you gonna learn? \xa0', 'DANI: What am I looking forward to learning? \xa0Well, whether we like it or not we age and our bodies do not always follow our input or our wishes, I think. I\'m just kind of looking forward to being present and accepting during that journey. Like finding out things about my health, like ""What? Diverticulitis?"" \xa0I put in the input and my wishes and sometimes it doesn\'t always do that and sometimes you have to be Hakuna Matata about it and say, ""ok, let\'s go on that ride"". I\'m looking forward to that presence and acceptance of that journey.', ""KATY: What's your risk for 2018?"", 'DANI: I\'ve got this longboard. I used to be a skater chick when I was in high school and I bought a longboard this summer off craigslist because I was like, ""That looks like fun."" And I took off and got going so fast! \xa0Those things are fast! \xa0And I wiped out. I flew into the air like a starfish. And wiped out pretty good and I have not gotten back on it since. only for little short rides. So I think I would like to get back up on that longboard. Maybe with some elbow pads.', 'KATY: When I hear longboard I hear surfboard.', 'DANI: Oh no. So how about you?', ""KATY: I couldn't think of anything. Because I was just like, what is actually, like I can't think of I'm doing anything that's even possibly risky. That's a dud answer. Sorry, that's a snake."", ""DANI: They don't all have to be winners."", ""KATY: It's like a snake in the fireworks box. They just go ssss."", 'DANI: Some people have a lot of fun with those things.', ""KATY: \xa0I actually love snakes I feel really comfortable around snakes. \xa0I think probably my biggest health risk will be speaking more clearly about what I mean by my own work. I think it's risky in that it's challenging. It's challenging to present some of this material. And so the risk, I mean it's not really a true, physical harm risk but the risk is creating discomfort in other. Which is a space I'm not super comfortable. I want everyone to feel good and comfortable and positive and I just don't think it's realistic."", ""DANI: That's true."", ""KATY: Challenging a lot of people to think and move differently. So just being more ok with other people's own personal journeys and how they relate to mine. \xa0Ok, what are you most committed to changing and/or improving in 2018."", ""DANI: Increasing my muscle mass and stamina. More hills and more muscle mass. \xa0How 'bout you?"", 'KATY: More self-care which is a mountain in itself for me. What underdeveloped talent are you willing, planning to explore this upcoming year.', 'DANI: Well, still juggling. Still, want to juggle more than 2 balls. And I would like to learn how to rollerblade.', ""KATY: Oh well that's risky behavior right there, right? "", 'DANI: I was at Venice beach and I\'m like, ""that looks like fun!"" So, I want to try that.', 'KATY: Well, the guy, Jason Lewis, went around the world? Part of it was rollerblading. So you guys should talk. Maybe get some tips.', ""DANI: Yeah. don't fall."", ""KATY: For me, I don't think it's a talent but one of the pursuances especially how it relates to my health is to dig into my ancestry a little bit."", 'DANI: Mm.', 'KATY: I just posted this on my Instagram but quickly I was reading that eco-based cultures can recite up to 500 years of their ancestry and ', 'DANI: Wow.', ""KATY: I know! \xa0And that skill, right, especially when you're not written based, not sure if that's the right word but if you're verbal based, story based..."", 'DANI: Right.', ""KATY: You force yourself to hold a lot more content versus outsourcing it to paper to use as a reference. \xa0It also is a skill that connects you to many others before you which also maybe sets you up for the fact that many come after you. So it's a way of being able to live and treat the land that you live on, because it's come from others as a gift and basically you're gifting it forward so it just has some role in sustainability, I think, as well as stress and patterns of behavior. So I sat down to do it and I was totally stumped on some of my branches. Some of my branches I could go back 2 generations. Some of my branches maybe 4 and then I was like, this doesn't even matter. People are like... as I'm trying to talk about land-based movements and human behavior, it's like, I can start with just knowing my own kind of root system, if you will, and it's been very interesting. Then to find out that a lot of people use that as a tool to kind of better understanding. And so that'd be fun to do with the kids. And also to recognize wow, I have some family trees. But it was all the patriarchal lines. The matriarchal lines are almost completely gone except for the first born girl to a firstborn girl. 6 times on one of my lines. And it's so interesting on that line I only have the matriarchal line. The matriarchal line was the one that was preserved culturally through stories. And just exploring those phenomenon and being in New Zealand for a time the "", "" have like a it's called a faudi papua tradition which is really understanding their history and taking it back to the plants and animals that superseded them and all the way to the universe and the stars and I was like, that's a really interesting... it's just good for me to recognize that I don't know very much. That culturally this is not very important or in recent times, it hasn't become very important. \xa0So I've been thinking about elders \xa0and again how people move over the land and what their experiences are like so I thought this would be a good way, to supplement other books that I'm reading that aren't about me or whatever. \xa0So. Ok. \xa0What brings you joy in health? How are you gonna have more of that in 2018?"", 'DANI: Hiking and camping baby! Yeah!', 'KATY: All right.', 'DANI: How about you?', ""KATY: Alone time. Alone time. \xa0It's pretty great."", 'DANI: Actually I would like to backpack alone.', 'KATY: Yeah!', 'DANI: That sounds really fun to me.', ""KATY: This summer my girlfriend and I just had a moms camping night out and we just took ourselves and we just, it was the best thing to set up your own tent for your own space and we made an awesome dinner and we went on a night hike and so I wasn't alone."", ""DANI: That's a good idea."", ""KATY: I didn't have that discomfort that maybe people have maybe about going out in the wilderness alone but at the same time it was way less required of me and I was like why don't we do that three or four times a year."", ""DANI: That's a good idea."", ""KATY: So definitely coming up. And it was just take care of yourself. We weren't trying to do everything together. We just wanted to go have this experience. We just kind of had backup with each other."", ""DANI: Yeah, that's cool. It's a good way to do it. \xa0So what brings you joy in health or how are you going to have more of that in 2018?"", 'KATY: Alone time. That was my alone time. \xa0No the question that you want to be asking is other than yourself who are you most committing to loving and serving?', ""DANI: And listening to you Katy. Well, of course, my little family. Always. But I'm also trying to be ever open hearted with the people who annoy me or whose behavior baffles me. So I'm trying to fill that gap with better thoughts and not ascribe ill intentions when it seems like there might be. Always trying to be more open hearted. \xa0How about you?"", ""KATY: My local community. My local like within 60 miles local. So just bringing and doing the thing that I normally do, instead of always doing ti on such a huge scale, really scaling it down.

And all the work that I do which is some of it's nutritious movement and some of what I do is non-nutritious movement Katy Bowman which also is a really big part of who I am. All right. Single-word time. I struggle with this one. \xa0One word that you would like to have as your health movement theme in 2018. And before you do, I pulled up last years word."", 'DANI: Oh gosh! \xa0Did you?', ""KATY: I did. I just wanted to see for the both of us if we felt that last year's' words summed this up?

It was definitely a low tech year with the exception of a hundred thousand miles flown all over the planet. With the exception of the aviation industry, it was low tech.', 'DANI: Wow. Good for us.', 'KATY: I thought so. But then it made more pressure to come up with a word because I did not have a word that was right. I had to go for a hyphenated word.', ""DANI: That's ok. That's ok. Do you want me to share my word first?"", ""KATY: I'll do mine first and then we'll do yours so we can end with your word."", 'DANI: Ok.', 'KATY: Ok.

Apple harvesting. There's also a lot of seed research going on and Salmon research. So participating in those research projects a little bit with our physical labor.

Like the exercises are so step-wise, what I call a graduating...

It\'s never should I change another title it\'s like, ""Could I do that?"" \xa0That to me would be cheating. It would be cheating. But...', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', ""KATY: I imagine someday all of my books, they all have whole body in the title. There's a section of books on whole body where they get released as a single set. \xa0Where it is like the whole body...yes, the whole body box."", 'STEPHANIE: I love it!', ""KATY: [00:15:38] The whole body box. You know, and they're all the same size. And maybe they're wrapped in a gold box. Kind of like my Little House on the Prairie series. Or my Trixie Belden books where you're like, you just work through all of this. You need all these exercises. \xa0But anyway, that's the question that keeps me awake at night."", ""STEPHANIE: I mean, I don't have a diastasis recti but I do have an abdomen and I really dig this book. I found a lot in it for me."", 'KATY: If you have a trunk, this book is for you.', 'STEPHANIE: ', ' has this in common with ', ' and probably with some of your other books as well; They both start with a section called ""Think"". \xa0', 'KATY: I think a broad stroke on my work is that corrective exercises aren\'t a solution. Because I think that there is this idea that to fix a physical ailment you just do some physical exercises on it until it fixes. \xa0Kind of like if you have a broken arm you put a cast on it and then the body itself does the work of healing; that the exercises are like a cast and the body itself does its own work for healing. \xa0Which I agree with in both cases. \xa0The difference is, in the case of a broken arm, there was a trauma that you were like, ""Oh, when I got hit by a bat, that broke my arm."" \xa0And that\'s an experience that we have so that\'s where that example comes from. Whereas in a lot of the other ailments where we are trying to use corrective exercises cast, what we\'re not aware of is, the bat that broke our arm is not usually the thing that we think it is. \xa0And so the bat\'s not gonna likely come back and hit your arm again. \xa0So thus, that cast, that temporary thing that you did, works. \xa0For a lot of people doing corrective exercises, they need them indefinitely because the bat that\'s hitting them all the time is their life. Their lifestyle. Their sedentarism.', 'STEPHANIE: Uh-huh.', ""KATY: So that's the first thing that I want to put right out there is; these are not really going to work ... like one of the reasons you have to keep doing the corrective exercises or the thing keeps manifesting or the issue keeps manifesting over and over again is you didn't change your life. You did not take the bat out. You keep whacking the bat on your body part and you don't know it yet because everyone's whacking the bat in the same way around you. Hashtag #whackthebat"", 'STEPHANIE: (whispers) ', ' \xa0That was a role reversal that time.', ""KATY: It's gonna happen. It has to grow. \xa0It's like it naturally follows. The whisper naturally follows a hashtag."", ""STEPHANIE: No, I'm picking up what you're laying down, girl."", ""KATY: \xa0If not, it just becomes a battle of hashtag and then we're right there at an SNL skit."", 'STEPHANIE: Hashtag #agreed.', 'KATY: Exactly (whispers) see what I mean.', 'STEPHANIE: (laughs) \xa0All right. Where were we? \xa0We were repeatedly whacking our body parts with a bat.', 'KATY: Yes. \xa0And so that\'s the piece that I want to get out there is that we have to think bigger than we are missing three or four muscle strengths. It\'s like you are missing three or four habits in your life, components of your life, parts of your house, that keep you in this cycle. And I don\'t mind that people need to exercise over and over and over again. That doesn\'t bother me. The reason I\'m trying to address that is when you work with enough people over a long enough period of time, what you recognize is there\'s a desperation that begins to mount. When you are taking the advised steps and things don\'t get better, because you\'ve been told that the advised steps are the solution. And then what happens is when they don\'t work or you find yourself, ""it\'s back again"", that it then becomes this kind of cycle of, oh it\'s just, there\'s a victimization to your experience. There\'s a desperation that casts a hue on everything you want to do with your body. And then, I\'ve seen it over and over again, there becomes a fear of movement. And I actually think that this phase, this cycle that I\'m talking about informs the next generation about how their bodies are supposed to work. And then you have a next group of people who aren\'t moving because they already know that these things are inevitable to them. And then we have these narratives about the long history of ailments handed down from generation to generation within our family. And then sometimes that\'s reinforced by this idea that you have the genetics for it. So I\'m just trying to go, let\'s change the entire system here. Is exercise something that humans need? No. It\'s something that humans in a particular culture will use to spot nourish. And let\'s talk about what we understand about nourishment. Is it something we need to do one time or do we nourish ourselves regularly through the day? \xa0Yes. Now let\'s talk about buying supplements in all these bottles and where they\'re manufactured and harvesting here. Is this something you can get from your diet that you just don\'t know how to eat in a particular way? \xa0And so, therefore, you\'re having to buy them over here? \xa0I\'m just trying to get to the root of it to offer a different paradigm and to make the paradigm as robust as possible. So that\'s what I\'m opening. That\'s why I\'m opening the book with ""Think"". \xa0And think is just a different... we use the word think and then we use the word move. But I would interject that thinking is just movement for your mind.', 'STEPHANIE: Right.', ""KATY: [00:21:34] \xa0That your mind has to move first so that your body can move more fully. So I can put mind movement and then I could put body movement. I could change that if you want. I could even go change it on the books that I've already written. \xa0But I think that that is my intention by putting those two sections apart. Because I think if you jump to move and you don't do the think part you won't get to the root of it. You could make those hours you invest in movement so much more effective, I think, by having a broader perspective."", ""KATY: Well it's interesting that that was your takeaway of that piece. \xa0So my intention with that piece is, when you sit, sitting is a scenario that we put ourselves in that requires outsourcing."", 'STEPHANIE: Uh huh.', ""KATY: When you're fully using a chair, the chair does the work for you. It's not to say when you're sitting you shouldn't be using your abdominal muscles. \xa0It means that, why would your abdominals be tensing if there's the back of the chair right there to do the work. That the natural response to being in a chair is to allow the chair to do the work."", 'STEPHANIE: Right. Ok.', ""KATY: Which is a different statement than, if you're sitting in a chair you shouldn't be engaging your abdominal muscles. \xa0Because engaging your abdominal muscles in a chair is really my recommendation. Right? \xa0It's like you need to sit differently to stop outsourcing so much to your chair if you're going to be sitting still."", 'STEPHANIE: Okay.', 'KATY: \xa0Continuing...not sitting in place.', 'STEPHANIE: In an ongoing way.', 'KATY: Correct. Thank you.', 'STEPHANIE: Okay.', ""KATY: \xa0So that's different than your particular take away. Although it's the...this is what makes writing so challenging is because we hear it as we hear it. So now to your second point though which was, so I'm like, right now, I'm processing how you heard it. So you heard it as we've all been told that we're supposed to have good posture in a chair."", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', ""KATY: So like if I'm sitting in a chair, holding my stomach in, that that's wrong. Because why would you be doing that when the chair's right here."", ""STEPHANIE: It's doing the work. It's what it's there for."", 'KATY: Yes. \xa0So this whole thing is fascinating right now.', 'STEPHANIE: I guess I conflated these two ideas. Right? About sucking in your gut or outsourcing your movement to the chair...', ""KATY: \xa0So my overall recommendation is get rid of the chair so this conversation is moot. \xa0But we're in a chair. We're in a chair. So what am I supposed to be doing in a chair. So in "", "" the first thing is sit differently. Stop outsourcing to the back of your chair. Now I would say that outsourcing the work to a chair is a different issue than sucking in your stomach while you're in a chair. Like one way to work more... if you're gonna be in a chair, you need to figure out a way to work more while you're in the chair. Or you don't. But I would say that's my, if you're asking how to move more it would be, outsource less. Which means scooch your back away from the chair."", 'STEPHANIE: Right.', ""KATY: Now you're on the front of the chair."", 'STEPHANIE: And now your abs are gonna do something.', ""KATY: Now you're torso, if you imagine like a beam going straight up, it's going to tend to fall front to back to right to left and all degrees in between. Now your core must feel stressed to take more responsibility for that. Which is different than sucking in your stomach. To your point of why we're sucking in our stomachs all the time, we need to not do that. Yes. Absolutely. And that's a key part of "", "" which is there is a difference between allowing your torso to work and sucking your stomach in. So we've kind of conflated this idea that I need more core strength which requires more trunk musculature contraction, so, therefore, I will just tense everything and now I'm working my trunk all the time. So "", ""really separates between those two ideas. \xa0Which is you need an active trunk but bracing, abdominal bracing, or sucking in your stomach is not the same thing as having a responsive core to the fact that your torso is falling forward, back, right, left, and all the degrees in between, when it's upright."", 'STEPHANIE: Okay.', ""KATY: I know. It's technical. Hashtag #technical. \xa0I whispered the hashtag. What are you going to do about it?"", ""STEPHANIE: I don't know. I feel like we're evolving to the next level with the whispering of the hashtags. I'm not sure I can totally keep up."", ""KATY: Well, we'll see how it goes."", 'STEPHANIE: So where does this book land in the spectrum that we always come back to: the ', ' - ', "" spectrum? There's a subsection in this book called "", '. ', ""KATY:It's kind of both. I mean I think all of the whole body series, right? So all of the little books, so "", ' and ', ' kind of fall outside of the whole body series. The whole body series is ', ', ', ' ... they all have whole body in the title. \xa0Those are books that really say here are the correctives, ', "", and here is a larger look at the issue: the non-moving lifestyle around it. And that's "", '. \xa0You will also see a lot of the exercises, very similar to ', "", are more like, and because it's often more times prevalent ... I don't even know if it's more prevalent in women ... but I don't know if a man going in for like a hernia, would even be checked for that. I think to be even checked for a diastasis recti - it's not like a standard checking. Many people could have it. We don't even know."", 'STEPHANIE: Because we have this idea that this just happens to pregnant people.', ""KATY: Exactly and that's not. It's both genders. It's children. It's nulliparous women. Nulliparous means..."", 'STEPHANIE: Having not borne a child.', 'KATY: Correct.', 'STEPHANIE: (whispers) Yes. Got one!', 'KATY: \xa0Nice to have a big fancy word.', 'STEPHANIE: Right?', 'KATY: \xa0I think so.', 'STEPHANIE: I do too.', ""KATY: So you'll see a lot of correctives relate to carrying things. Like here's how to put more non-exercise work in. How to think about moving when you're not exercising. That's what's "", ' about all of the books. Anytime we step outside of that ""here\'s your twelve exercises. Here\'s the program. The end"" we\'re talking more about non-exercise movement. And non-exercise movement is what\'s really what\'s hallmark too about ', "" is that we have got to start discussing more than exercise or people are never going to move more than an hour a day, which is sedentarism. I don't care how many exercises you stuff in that hour or even two hours. We are still sedentary. And if none of that exercise or movement that we do is to serve non-exercise purposes, then we're completely outsourcing. So I'm always talking more to like steer people towards ... away from sedentarism and away from outsourcing which are two different goals."", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah. You write: ""If the physical outcome of your body isn\'t working for your life then it\'s the life that has to change to get your body working."" \xa0I want to just hang out with that idea for a sec. Because this is basically your thesis over and over in every book. It\'s always in there. It\'s simple. It\'s profound. And frankly, it\'s a little terrifying.', ""KATY: You feel terrified? \xa0I'm sorry."", 'STEPHANIE: I mean, you know, people often are, I am, resistant to change.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""STEPHANIE: And so that's the profundity of what you're saying. And it's as you've been saying, if you keep hitting yourself with a bat, you're gonna come up with the same result no matter how many correctives you're doing."", ""KATY: I love that I use the bat and a broken arm a violent example in the podcast. In the book, it's like sun on the carpet. \xa0Do you remember?"", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah. I do it was more gentle.', ""KATY: It's more gentle. The sun's just fading the carpet there. Doesn't matter. You keep moving the carpet it's just gonna fade another spot. You have to fix the sun. And here it's like if you whack yourself with a bat. So, I'm really hearing, I'm hearing this idea that you're expressing as terrifying. \xa0"", 'STEPHANIE: Mmm.', ""KATY: \xa0What Movement Matters is saying is that what if you are not resistant to change ... that you are resistant to movement. That your natural state is resistant to movement. That you're not at all resistant to change. That change is inevitable. That if you go sit outside, you will see that everything is constantly changing around you. You're not resistant to change at all. You're just changing over into the same thing over and over again because of your resistance to movement. \xa0I think that we've reframed - maybe we've just never known or understood - we've reframed resistance to movement as resistance to change when change, we are natural begins which means change is inevitable and constant. Seasons come and go. We change, we change, we change. But there's this resistance to movement and there's an unconscious constant seeking of things that allow us even less movement and that if you can reframe everything in terms of this is saving me movement, the very thing that I've already declared out loud in my journal or whatever, as the thing that I want. Then we'll see all the time that you're actually picking something that you don't want over and over and over again because you haven't framed it in movement. So I'm just trying to constantly do that to say, oh it looks like, you know, like I'm trying to help see things in terms of movement because I think a resistance to movement, a resistance to expend extra energy is a less judgmental way of understanding ourselves. It's a conservation thing. It's a thing that we understand about nature and the species that live within it. And therefore we're the same as everything else. We're just resistant to the physical change. It's just that some of us who have a certain amount of power are able to do that more and more the thing that it is that we vocalize that we don't want. \xa0And so if you're doing something that you don't want to be doing to me the first way of changing that is to recognize it. To see it. \xa0And to keep working to see it as terrifying as it is, to me it's the opposite of terrifying. To me, it's like, so there's something that I could be doing. To me, and this is just everyone has their nature, to me not knowing the laws in which I'm operating under, the physical laws, that's terrifying."", 'STEPHANIE: Right.', ""KATY: How can I negotiate this earth if I don't understand how the earth works. And so that's really just what motivates me all the time is to try to understand what are the rules. \xa0And the rules that I follow or that I'm trying to understand are the natural law level. The physical laws has been my personal pursuit. So just reframing things into that. So it's interesting. What terrifies one..."", 'STEPHANIE: Liberates another.', ""KATY: Exactly it's like a lullaby to the other one. So it's so helpful, I think, these discussions between people, informed in all different ways, because it helps everyone I think."", ""STEPHANIE: So you're saying it's ok if I'm gradually losing my grip on the bat that I've been using to break my arm over and over."", 'KATY: Totally.', 'STEPHANIE: As long as I keep loosening up.', ""KATY: You know what? I don't even say you have to loosen it. I think maybe just see the bat might be the work of a lifetime."", 'STEPHANIE: Right. Just see the bat.', ""KATY: Seeing the bat helps inform the next group.

Ok, that's fine. You can't take away really that you've seen it. That will inform the next groups. I really don't have any other agenda. I guess all of this is just me working through what I felt like I needed to do with my life. And I'm happy with that.

It had already been described and mentioned in other places where it was pertinent. \xa0Still, it was such an important concept that it needed its own chapter simply because you are perceiving importance by what's a chapter title. Like if you just skimmed chapter headings, someone else has done that work to help you say hey this is important. Read this section. Or this section is important and even if you didn't read it, the chapter header gives you, it informs you of importance. \xa0You're not just reading words. The structure is informing you - is shaping you. So I was like, well, it's important. I don't really have anything else to say about it. I'm not going to ... in fact adding more ways to restate would almost detract from this is so important it gets its own chapter. You already know what to do..."", 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.

Right? \xa0That chapter is worth 30 hours."", ""STEPHANIE: That's the back to body school philosophy."", ""KATY: Exactly. You've got to do it.

All bodies are welcome. Are you ready to get moving?"", 'MUSIC', 'June 7, 2010. A good question in my Ask Katy today. Standing workstations are clearly a good idea and I have fashioned one for myself but what is too much standing? We all know that people whose jobs require constant standing like restaurant servers and factory workers are often plagued with varicose veins. Is there a balance to be struck here? This is a great question. So we\'ve got a situation where sitting constantly is creating disease and standing constantly is creating disease. So do you see the theme? Although the research and media are going to probably miss the boat on this one, the problem isn\'t the sitting or the standing for that matter but the constant and continuous use of a single position. Even this question smacks of someone from a North American and European perspective. As if sitting is bad and standing is bad and the only option left must be lying down. As if there are only 3 choices for how to position your body. As if there aren\'t a thousand ways you can position your body. Believe it or not, the positions you are able to put your body in are learned by observation. Our culture\'s use of chairs or toilets, our beliefs of what our posture means to others (think of women who cross their legs and adjust their heads to look demure or men who just their chests or flex their elbows to communicate authority. And even our clothing - rigid shoes, narrow skirts, etc., have all resulted in self-induced joint rigidity. All the movements you have never done are movements that would have toned muscle or kept connective tissue moist and supple and kept blood oxygen flowing evenly to all areas of the body. Instead, we have huge chunks of unused muscles. Bones scraping together at the joints and increasing friction. And we are constantly medicating to make living possible in our physical agony. This all sounds pretty depressing I know but the totally awesome, super cool, and exciting thing is, it can be different whenever you\'re ready. Another awesome thing is while I may seem like the only person saying these strange things, there are other people out there who have researched this for the last 100 years. The big difference between then and now is 1) there wasn\'t the internet back then which must have made it quite difficult to share insights collectively and 2) there is now a wide breadth of subjects a ""good education"" covers. Good educations is in quotes - just as a side note.', ""Most of the people observing the very real phenomenon of cultural postural habits and habitual uses of the body which are physical anthropologists and the people in charge of health education and prescription (which can be medicine) are in two completely different sciences. They don't even talk to each other - even at parties. But I am hopeful my education in the biomechanics of human movement and disease, coupled with my awesome typing skills and Al Gore's internet is going to help. How is this information ever going to get to the people? One blog post at a time I guess. One extremely cool journal article from 1955, World Distribution of Certain Postural Habits, reported the findings of physical anthropology professor Gordon W. Hewes. It was an amazing read and if you'd like to have more than my take on it, you can "", ""and I'll just link that in the show notes. As many anthropologists know, the way we move is mostly a result of our cultural inheritances and have very little to do with genetics. Clothing, terrain, temperature, gender, class, fear are few of the many factors that adjust our joints when sitting and standing. Hughes reported on about 100 resting postures in the world and I have "", "", perhaps, while why our western joint health and metabolism, which is dependent on muscle length (and I'd modify it really to say muscle range and the use of it) is the poorest in the world. So we need to think bigger. There is more than just sitting and standing. Create 10 different options of each. If you have a standing workstation, stand a few different ways every hour. When you sit, sit a few different ways every hour. Open your mind and open your joints. When you get home, stay out of your chairs and try a lot of these worldly options (and note, if you don't have a spear, a broom may work. Because one of the images in the picture has a spear.) Circle the ones you can't maintain for more than five minutes and make a note to practice that posture at the beginning and the end of an exercise session. And parents, don't insist that kids sit in the same fashion as us stiffer folks. Allow them to explore other options. And join them. They can teach you something about natural movement. Also if you do spend a yoga or a stretching class cycling through 10 or so of these postures, know that while this cycle is a great thing, getting back into your usual sitting position the other 6-10 hours of the day reduces your health just the same. Adjust the way you sit as often as possible for real deep cellular change. Hewes concludes his research: “Physiologists, anatomists, and orthopedists to say nothing of specialists in physical education have dealt exhaustively with a few ideal postures. Principally the fairly rigid attention stance beloved of the drill master, the students, and the stenographers habits of sitting at desks. The English postural vocabulary is mediocre. A fact which in itself inhibits our thinking about posture. Quite the opposite is true of the languages of India, where the yoga system has developed an elaborate postural terminology and rationale - perhaps the world's richest. In conclusion, I should like to stress the deficiencies in our scientific concern with postural behavior many which arrive from the all too common neglect by non-anthropologists of cross-cultural data.” Gordon Hewes, I concur. "", ' So I wrote a book', ' because I think that our mindset, our sedentarism, keeps us chronically looking for an ideal posture. And a lot of the conflict that is kind of demonstrated within people who have kind of described a different ideal posture, comes about evaluating things over different time scales or maybe just looking at different things. And at the end, this is also kind of a ', ' take on it which is, if you set the question up to be what is the most ideal static posture you will just spend the rest of your life, or hundreds of years, eliminating one static posture after another. And so what I like about biological plausibility is just the understanding that movement has already been established as a very necessary thing so we\'re kind of at a cultural impasse where sedentarism is required for the mechanics of this particular culture. And so if this particular culture\'s question is how can I be still in the most healthy fashion, it kind of leads you to think that there\'s no - that cultural shifts aren\'t possible. Where I think I\'d like to expand the questions more to be ""how can we adjust the culture for the well being of everyone in it?"" Is there a way that many elements of the culture can survive as well as the people within it? Because the people, ultimately, make up the culture. And so if the culture is interested in long-term duration ... Just like a corporation, if a large company wants to be well the people who work there need to also be well. Either that or people are seen more as, I would say, a commodity, so they can always bring more people in to drive a culture. So it is nice to have many different cultural options and being counter culture, counter-culture is relative. So I would say that the theme of the pieces that I picked is really relativity. So I sit on the floor. That\'s counter to some cultures. It is not counter to all cultures and it is actually not counter to most cultures or to most human behavior. I think it\'s important to remember that what\'s happening right now in this podcast listening, smartphone culture, that\'s the outlier. The furniture is the outlier, not my activity of not using it. Relativity.', 'One of my favorite college courses was Medical Latin. I loved it because speaking Latin made me think of gods and goddesses and togas and baklava and riding a moped after swimming in the Mediterranean. Which, now that I think of it, are all Greek things, actually. It turns out I love all greek things and I can\'t wait until I move to my tiny Greek island/olive tree farm/alignment center. You\'re all invited. Most anatomy or physiology students take medical Latin at some point in their college career and we take it because we have to memorize hundreds of names of bones and muscles and tissues and functions. And those names are in Latin. So knowing even a little bit of Latin helps because then you don\'t have to memorize everything. You want to know an interesting story? A teaching doctor became perplexed during orthopedic rounds holding up an X-ray of a bowlegged patient and asking medical students for the diagnosis, he was disappointed to see a third of the students got the answer right. One third got the answer wrong and the remaining one third just shook their heads. They didn\'t know. They were confused. So you might have heard of these terms: knock-kneed and bowlegged. But if you were way smarter and better edumacated you would use these terms: Varus and Valgus or Valgus and Varus which is my point today. The doctor scolded his students (and I just made that word up), told them the correct answer, and then told them to look up the latin to find out what the problem was. And here was the problem: somewhere down the line the orthopedic terms had become reversed from the Latin definitions. So valgus is Latin for having the knees angled outward. Varis is Latin for bent or grown inward. Shocked that the definitions were the opposite of his knowledge, he checked the 24 current orthopedic textbooks and found that 23 used the reverse terms and only one made note of the historical versus current text. ""This particular pair of terms has caused more confusion than any other pair, partly because the original Latin terms have the opposite meaning to that which is now universally accepted."" That\'s a quote from the doctor guy. And if you are worried that this guy did a lot of hard work for naught, don’t be. Because he wrote a paper on it and got it published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Nice! Now I\'m gonna tell you how the terms probably got reversed. And I can do this because I am a huge nerd. And I have my very own copy of the lexicon of orthopedic etymology. I know you\'re jealous. In the original definition, the terms valgus and varus referred to the position of the joint. So using the Latin definition of valgus, the bent outward knee would look like bowlegged. And the Latin definition of Varis would look like knocked kneed. So with Valgus, imagine the knees are wider so they\'re wider than the pelvis, and Varis, the knees are closer to each other so the distance between them is more narrow than the pelvis is wide. Anyhow at some point, someone translated these terms for a modern orthopedic text. And instead of the definition referring to the joint, they applied it instead to what the lower segment of the leg, which is the shin bone, was doing. So replacing the word knee with lower leg, the new definition read: ""having the lower leg angled outward"" which is the opposite of the original configuration. By accidentally changing one word in the definition the meaning was reversed which is crazy right? Here\'s a Katy factoid: I love the science of semantics and I feel that a huge breakdown in health and wellness is that students have not learned anatomy in the most correct way. (And I\'m gonna just pop in here as Katy in 2018 and say I really mean to recognize that a knee joint in a translation is different than the shin and that those slight translation changes end up changing the meaning. And I run into this a lot because I write for popular publications and they\'re often edited towards the more simple. Like when I try to say you want to put your arm or their shoulder here it\'ll come back from the editor ""well we think more people would understand it if you put it like this."" But the way that they\'ve done it makes it technically wrong. And there\'s a lot of pressure to leave it technically wrong for better understanding. But when you do that over time what happens is the technically wrong becomes understood by almost everybody and then that creates the pressure to come up with a new definition. So, again, I\'m interested in cultural phenomenon and how our understanding of movement and our body has been shaped by knowledge - scientific knowledge in this case because it\'s an aspect of our culture. So anyway... this is again falling under that kind of cultural phenomenon and relativity.) Anyway, the paper that he wrote calls for the elimination of the Varus and Valgus terms altogether as they are used incorrectly. So the doctor\'s paper also suggested using the uber clear terms bow legged and knock-kneed to keep everyone on the same and correct page. This also makes me feel better as a patient. Say I had one varis and one valgus leg and would need the varis one amputated, which one would they take? Scary! I don\'t like to think about stuff like that. I like to think about things like Antonio Banderas instead. Just kidding. Maybe. (And the paper that I was referencing, I\'ll link to it in the show notes is called: ', 'VOICEOVER: If you’re into podcasts it’s likely you love the audio format.

Ok now back to your regularly scheduled programming with Katy Bowman.', 'This morning there was a great question on our Facebook page. ""I\'m active in a pregnancy group here on Facebook and it\'s so sad to hear all these women having problems with pelvic pain, leaking urine, even prolapse. They think it\'s normal or something they have to live with and I keep posting about your exercises but I can\'t seem to get through to them. So the idea of healing yourself with exercise and alignment perhaps sound too good to be true. In 1975 two researchers, Becker and Maiman, developed something called the Health Belief Model, HBM. They suggested that the likelihood of someone adopting a behavior that would prevent or correct some disease or physical issue depended on two things (and don\'t worry I\'ll tell you what those two things are.) And in case you are wondering that I am some kind of information freak-a-zoid, let me introduce you to a little garage sale find called', '"" by Rod K. Dishman. This little textbook cost me a whopping 3 bucks and you never know what treasures are lying around other people\'s houses. Which makes me sound like a klepto. No judgment on my klepto readers. I like shiny things too. So applying the HBM to your question: A woman would need two things to be motivated enough to follow your advice on alignment and the pelvic floor. She would need 1) to believe that she had a personal vulnerability to PFD (or pelvic floor disorder) or SI joint or hip pain and 2) believe that the consequences of her condition would be severe. The first isn\'t typically an issue because chances are if they\'re reading your posts and mine they already have an issue so there\'s not a lot of wondering if they\'re going to have a pelvic floor disorder some day. Someday is today. The severity of the issue is more challenging. And I don\'t think that women understand that a little PFD now can mean a whole lot of PFD later. I will write until I\'m blue in the, um, fingers, that if you have a little pelvic floor issue now - perhaps a little sneeze pee - then in the not so distant future your organs will be falling out (That\'s terrible! This is me in 2018. I would never write that sentence now. That just goes on an on... ok, I\'m gonna read it as I wrote it). If you have a little bit... (sometimes I don\'t like myself very much) ... if you have a little pelvic floor issue now, perhaps a little sneeze pee, then in the not so distant future your organs will be falling out, your hips will need replacing, your knees will need replacing, your SI joint will wobble around and push on your sciatic nerve, your toes will go numb, your lumbar spine will degenerate, your organs will need to be removed, your vaginal delivery will likely turn into a cesarean (oh look it. This is what I say right after that.) When I read the above paragraph I feel like a bad person because it sounds mean or something. And I don\'t say it because I\'m trying to make money. And I don\'t say it because I\'m trying to make you any more tense than you already are. I\'m saying it because somebody has to. Somebody has to start saying that the way you are using your body is part of what is making you sick. And it will continue to make you sick in the future. And it is your job, not mine, to hear it and take action. ', ""(Ugh! Katy Katy Katy. So I write a lot softer now. And I'm thinking about what I just wrote. And I don't feel that differently about the sentiment about which I'm writing which is: I believe that culturally we are very resistant to the idea that there is a way of using the body versus the body is just kind of naturally doing what it is inclined to do. And also that we have much more control over it. I guess I'm trying to edit myself in my mind. Like control meaning, we could be picking much different things but they would be sometimes totally radically different. And as we have these phenomena of these degenerations in our body that require major medical action and we see things like replacements increase in frequency and start going into younger generations, it's perplexing that we're not asking these questions more vigorously. And so again, I'm also interested in why that is. And I feel like it does have something to do with it feels icky. It feels icky to point it out. It feels mean to point it out even when it's like the opposite of meanness. I find it helpful to identify something that I could choose. Like to become aware of the choices that I am making and I've gone through that process both physical and then also in the non-physical - the choice of thinking about something different and that how you choose to think about things, the words that you choose to say, changing outcomes. And that's also why I would heavily edit this section because I think that the way that I've written it here would appeal to some people and would also completely turn off other people. It would not be the key for them to hear this message. So I would - the sentiment is the same but the writing - I don't know how the writing might have made this kind of fall on dead ears. Anyway, )"", 'I\'ve just decided that the theme of 2012 is personal responsibility. (and I could say in 2018 I\'m still on that kick.) Oh and also upper body strength. (And also same for 2018.) Which reminds me that I need to hang from my indoor monkey bars for three minutes before I spend any more time writing this post. Ok, I\'m back. And I\'m buff. And I\'m definitely in that order. Now that I\'ve explained the health belief model, I need to add some more info because you see the HBM is not really that complete. It turns out that many people know that they need to get exercise. They believe that they will die if they don\'t do it. Yet they still don\'t do it. And we haven\'t had to go to the extreme of dying from something. Most of you, dear readers, have some ailment for which I\'ve given you an exercise prescription or information to follow and you still don\'t really comply with regularity that matches your desire to no longer have issue X. Well, not you who is shaking your head and saying ""not me. I follow your advice to a T"" I\'m not talking about you. You used to sit in the front row of the class, didn\'t you? So why is it that we can\'t seem to manage to execute the behaviors that we desire to? Enter the Self Efficacy Theory. This 1977 theory, I was born just before this came out, states that ""all behavioral changes are meditated by a cognitive mechanism of perceived efficacy."" Which is a lot of fancy words to say that you have to believe that you can perform the recommended behavior? And I like the word believe because as a science type, you know all boring and math and lists, and bad at art, and no passion, and left brain, and black and white, and don\'t see in color, and can\'t taste food and my life is very straight and adventureless, I don\'t really know what it means. Yet I bet that you, like me, knows what it feels like to be 100% on board with what you believe. So here are some indicators that might help you identify a lower level of self-efficacy. 1) I\'m afraid that I\'m not doing it right. 2) If I can\'t do it completely then I don\'t feel good doing it at all. 3) I\'ve tried the healthy thing before and I couldn\'t do it. 4) My attempts at health have failed in the past. 5) I\'m not that coordinated. 6) But I\'ve always had this - fill in the blank. Sound familiar? Your belief system, especially in your ability to physically do something is learned from your personal experiences as well as the good and bad experiences of those you model - so parents, peer group, etc. The self-efficacy theory has been researched and is believed to be the most successful in explaining habitual exercise behavior. Which is a lot of fancy words to say that, even if your organs are falling out and your hips hurt so badly that you can no longer walk, even if you thought that them falling out will kill you - good news it won\'t - you still wouldn\'t spend a couple hours a day doing exercises and making a standing workstation and giving up heeled shoes and valuing your health enough to really invest in it because you don\'t believe that you can change. And therein lies the problem. It doesn\'t matter how many solutions you post, reader who posed the question that launched me on this post, or how many blog posts I write and emails I answer. The people with, in this case, pelvic pain, or leaking urine, or pelvic organ prolapse have to repair themselves. They have to value the repair more than you do. And that\'s tough because you\'re excited in following my blog and posting about whole body alignment because you\'ve chosen to help others. And they\'re reading your Facebook post as something to fill extra time and aren\'t necessarily looking for answers, just interaction. Which are two fundamentally different things. Interaction is often mistaken for taking action. Then, original poster, there could be the other issue too. That they totally believe in themselves and just don\'t believe what you\'re posting. The prevailing notion that our body injuries a result of a single incident and not the slow accumulation of micro-damage makes it very difficult to even begin to understand our ailments. In other words, if you were asked by a health practitioner how your back went out, you are much more likely to say ""I was moving a 40 pound bag of cement up 27 flights of stairs,"" then you are to say, ""I sat in a chair for 10 days for, I don\'t know, 17 years, and I\'ve been under a lot of emotional stress too. And then I used my body for a huge athletic feat with no training program whatsoever."" In other words, we have an inexcusable lack of knowledge regarding our own function and the inability to see that what we\'ve been doing is what has led directly to the ailments we have now. So maybe these women think that you are spending your valuable and precious time posting nonsense. Although I believe with the other half of my brain, that it\'s more interesting and has a personality, and passion, and loves poetry and sewing and rainbows and fairies and stuff, that if you have come here to read, or they have come to your site to read, that the material is resonating with them on a cellular level. The fact that they don\'t trust the info has more to do with trusting their own ability to do something with it. Or their efficacy. And P.S., I can\'t post the problem without posting a solution, can I? So if you feel that you might have an issue with self-efficacy then you can do a little mental investigation and I went through all of these myself, friends. ', ""But I don't really know how we separate physical exercises from mental ones. Because everything is both all physical and both also non-physical and many other realms. And I think that one of the things that I have found in my own personal evolution of being a biomechanist in addition to being a human, is to recognize that the big separation between looking at the physical without looking at the impact of the social and the cultural and the psychological effect on the physical is just that the body is just never fully integrated. And we can call ailments, you know, of the spine and the hips and the knees and the neck, we can think of them as these very discrete things but I have found it most helpful for, let's just say, for feeling well in my parts to recognize that often times these parts are not integrated. Not just integrated into the physical. They're not integrated into the social and the mental. And so for those of you who have been following my work since"", ' which came out a long time ago to essentially to ', ' you can see that evolution of a full integration. To go the idea of preaching the benefits of a whole body but still keeping the idea of a whole body with deep to your skin without recognizing that whole body has to do with, you know, the planet. Or the universe. Really that full integration. So obviously I feel like my brain has expanded more as well. Anyway.', 'Thank you very much for listening.

And so I guess that kind of resonates with that last essay that I just read which is when I\'m given a bunch of action tips and I can contrast that with all of the reasons my mind automatically generates to why those action tips are impossible, that is a habit to recognize. Just as much as it is to always have your ankles crossed or to always have your ribs lifted, you know, or your pelvis tucked. Equally important to recognizing the habit of rib-thrust is to recognize your habits of thought patterns that are keeping you from moving. That\'s it in a nutshell. And it\'s what has shaped this upcoming podcast series. Because when reading or listening to something gives me instant feedback on how to self-adjust I\'m smitten. I\'m smitten for the contrast because it\'s like an alignment point for me. It\'s like ""oh, look at that! I just came up with six reasons"" I\'m gonna put air-quotes around “valid”. Because I would say that all reasons are “valid”. But it just means that you haven\'t figured out a solution yet. Like you haven\'t figured out what has to be moved elsewhere to make it possible. So to be able to change a habit without changing anything else that\'s like trying to solve a Rubix cube but you\'re not willing to actually twist any of the squares. So all the squares have to constantly be moving, but that\'s the problem, right? This is sedentarism or trying to solve problems in sedentarism. And the natural law of things is everything has to stay moving. So anyway, the upcoming episodes are shooting for just that. They\'re a bunch of practical versus a ton of theory. And theory is fun and I love it but it can often get in the way of action. And I\'ve put out a ton of theory.

The muscle atrophies and then maybe it's just not able to hold the hair. \xa0I'm not sure if that's why it falls out or if it's not growing or what. Because that's not my field. But it has to do with muscular atrophy. You've got a ton of muscles all over your body that aren't just those ones we work in the gym. And every hair follicle has its own. "", ""Anyhow, just a few years back - I could have sworn I talked about it on the show, but maybe I didn't - I started growing out my own hair after reading that. I wanted to see what a natural hair follicle load would be like. And if we think of the natural movement of the hair muscles it’s bending underneath the weight of the hair, of course, your hair moves the place it attaches when you’re moving, so I'm not sure if sitting there with long hair - not sure if that’s really just your hair sitting too. Some casts for hair follicles then, off the top of my head, (sorry I couldn’t help it), could be: cutting your hair, ponytails or other bound hairstyles, hats. \xa0Right? These would all be hair muscle casts."", ""And I just remembered, you know, \xa0I had a hair stylist and she was telling me she had a scan done of the blood flow to her head skin.

Was it a heat scan? I don’t know how they were measuring blood flow, but these white/gray patches were next to other areas on her scalp that were rendering as healthier flow. And they probably had a different color. And they had advised her to start brushing to stimulate these areas. They said to stimulate blood flow, but it could also be that they were really just stretching the muscles. Right? By pulling on the hair as the brush went through. So that’s an important takeaway - is something might work, but why it works might be different once you've investigated it better. Or, it could be that blood flow is the result of muscle use or muscle stretch really, \xa0so flow and stretch are lockstep.

Play deprivation is associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. They need more time to learn. They need more time to play, Angela says. We will talk about some of the actions we can take to make both of those things happen. \xa0Angela Hanscom, welcome to Move Your DNA!"", 'ANGELA: \xa0Thanks for inviting me.', 'KATY: I am familiar with your book. Your book is great. I am less familiar with ', '. So can you talk just a little bit about what that is?', 'ANGELA: \xa0Sure! So essentially what ', ""is is basically outdoor play experiences for children out in nature. So, inspiring them to play in creative ways but there's also a lot of free play. So every three hours of programming, there's a play experience where the environment is used to inspire kids to play in different ways. And then they have at least an hour and a half of free play every three hours. And it just, and even the experiences are very open-ended and child driven. So that's "", ' in a nutshell.', 'KATY: Is ', ', would someone offer TimberNook as a class? Do people come to TimberNook to be certified to be able to offer TimberNook classes? \xa0Or is TimberNook actually the place where you go to get that three-hour experience or both?', ""ANGELA: That's a good question. We actually don't do classes. We use it in the form of camps or programs. We're really calling it a program because we found that a class is a very short amount of time and it's just not allowing kids to get into a deeper level of play. So we, most of our programs are at least 3 hours long for that sole purpose. And the other thing that's really unique to "", "" is often you can't find the adults or we're hidden out there. So we're watching the kids play and create societies and really just inspiring them to get to take play to a whole new level. So it's in the form of like a forest program year round or a summer camp. That's how it started was actually in the form of summer camp. But what's happening now as I speak internationally about this outdoor play issue that we're having - that we're taking that away from children - I'm hearing from adults that they try to take pieces of this knowledge and bring it to administrators to create change. And they're getting a lot of kickback. So what we've learned is that the teachers and the educators really need to experience us first hand to create change. So really the next step for "", "" is we're going to be bringing our programs into the pre-schools to bring back outdoor play."", 'KATY: What is my next question from that? \xa0So who are your ', "" instructors then? I guess that's my question."", 'ANGELA: So, we call the ', ' providers and most of them are experts in the field of therapy or education.', 'KATY: Okay.', 'ANGELA: A lot of them are doctorate level Occupational Therapists: ""I\'ve been doing research on this"", or Psychologists, Social Workers. And then a lot from the educational field: Montessori, Waldorf, and that sort of thing. Reggio Emilia. This kind of combines the world of healthcare and play.', 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', 'ANGELA: It links it like a bridge.', ""KATY: So there's a lot of pediatric Occupational Therapists. I've worked with lots of them."", 'ANGELA: Right.', ""KATY: But not all of them, I would say, have brought in that additional layer of movement that is natural movement. It's like I think of everything in terms of movement so even time in nature is really just very diverse experiences of movement and texture and sound and wind and light. The resiliency, the same resiliency that you would find in response to a movement with less diversity is really ramped up in a natural setting."", 'ANGELA: Yeah.', ""KATY: What was on your journey that made you be really what I would say - and you could correct me if I'm wrong - but still an outlying therapist? \xa0Right? Like I would say you're on the outliers of OTs in the fact that you have this diversity to your offering."", 'ANGELA: So none of this was planned. So what happened was, you know, I had my own children and my first child had a lot of sensory issues and I was overscheduling her. ', '. \xa0And it was all about activities. And then I used to have nightmares of going into the woods, even. So it was pretty ironic. I overcame a lot of fears. There was many things that happened in my life that got me down this road. But in a nutshell what happened was I started linking what I saw out in the woods, children, observing children playing out there and comparing that to what I was hearing in the schools. And there was a lot of frustration in the school environment with children and parents and even teachers where they\'re not allowed to play in the same ways as years past. And so when my daughter was 5 years old and she went to kindergarten, my eye-opening experience was the teacher said, ""We have a five minutes snack."" And she said, ""If that becomes an issue we\'re going to do a working snack."" \xa0She said, ""We don\'t have time to teach your children how to cut with scissors or to tie their shoes, so please put elastic laces on them. My husband\'s gonna precut everything at nighttime."" And then they had a 15-minute recess. And they were five. And she said, ""As soon as it snows we\'re bringing your kids inside."" And as a therapist that works on development, I just knew that none of this was right. And so that was really what kind of stepped me on this path. And I started looking at different educational philosophies like Reggio Emilia and I looked at Finland where the kids were in the river dissecting fish and I ended up homeschooling for a couple years. And also realized that there was not many kids playing outside, so it was really just a series of events that happened in my life that got me down this road. And then what happened was', "" And that's how TimberNook got out there in a big way from the beginning was this unique message about how we're restricting children's movement over and over and then how it's impacting their development. Especially the senses."", ""KATY: \xa0Well especially when your job is to basically provide the movement and sensory experience that's missing then you have both sides of it. \xa0You could see the therapy that would have to be done on the other side as well as why maybe some of the therapy needs exist in the first place. That's a very unique perspective that you have."", 'ANGELA: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: So this podcast series is all super action based. Because we could probably have a full year series where you and I just talk about the problem. I mean we could talk about the nuances of the issues and there are many layers. ', 'ANGELA: Yeah.', 'KATY: But taking action, I think at the end, I feel like most of us hear you say something like that and go, ""Right. Nature. Movement. You don\'t need to convince me any more than I needed."" \xa0The challenging part is how. What are the steps? And so I asked you to come with three of your steps and I\'m gonna match your three with my three and hopefully with those six steps somebody listening can have a glimmer of an opportunity. Like movement, outdoor movement, outdoor movement with kids will become more accessible just because of the tips we give. So I\'m gonna have you give a tip and I\'m gonna tip. That kind of, I think, I\'ll try to riff my tips on your tips. So... yeah. \xa0', 'ANGELA: \xa0So one action item is to extend recess to a full hour.', 'KATY: All right! \xa0You know, my kids are in that kind of common school program at this point. They\'re still in kind of a nature school, homeschool, homeschool coop hybrid that we are fortunate enough to have in our area. But I was just - it\'s back to school. So we\'re recording this mid-September. \xa0I think everyone\'s back in that first week of coming off and really seeing how unscheduled summer is compared to - I read your Washington Post piece and you really list out- there\'s like a picture of the transitions in school. And you can see everything is in 35-45 minute blocks and they\'re kind of about-faces sometimes. ""Do this. \xa0Put this down. Do this over here."" And I have nephews that are now in school and they are reporting back that they only have 35 minutes - this is a middle school - they only have 35 -40 minutes of lunch/recess combo. And they don\'t have smartphones, but all of their peers seem to and they said that basically sitting in the lunchroom and at recess is now looking at devices. Because they\'re allowed to use their devices on their free time. Which totally shocked me. I assumed - I just assumed that devices weren\'t allowed in academic settings like you could have it on you for emergencies but that you couldn\'t actually pull it out. And I think probably because I went to regular school - we couldn\'t do anything. I couldn\'t even bring out my own books a lot of times to read.', 'ANGELA: Right.', ""KATY: Like it all had to be kind of planned. So the amount of movement I think is significantly less than what you and I had or what my peer groups, you know, late 30s, early 40s, had. We didn't even have that much movement but even that movement that we had, I had an hour for lunch and recess. That's gone now, which is, at least in this school's where we are. "", 'ANGELA: Right.', 'KATY: \xa0So my tip is gonna kind of riff on yours because I think that most parents right now would have no idea how to extend a recess. \xa0You can\'t, as a parent, tomorrow, extend your kids\' recess. You can certainly start talking to your school district. Talk to your PTAs, talk to your teachers. If you have more flexible schooling situations that don\'t have so many things that they must offer because they have various government regulations, you can have a little bit of space. But I was just thinking, how can we, as parents, increase recess tomorrow? So I wanted to put out the idea of: \xa0create home recess sessions. Because I think that sometimes we forget that our home might be squashing movement in the same way that any place with a desk or an office so clearly does. So this is an example: We have a family movie night once a week, but I will actually pause the movie midway for a recess. And it\'s not like, ""ok everyone has to go move to offset the effects of sitting down and watching this movie."" It\'s more like play, spontaneous fun. Like, ""All right. \xa0We gotta go have a family sprint session."" Or ""For breakfast tomorrow I need to make something right now so we need to go harvest some berries or rake some leaves or let\'s all get on our bikes and let\'s go ride out to that pole and back."" Just some sort of recess and of peeling everyone away can be a transition - I mean it is a transition. So everyone gets kind of jumbled when we first started. But once everyone was outside, that five minute break, because we\'ve broke the inertia, turned into something more like everyone, once they were in that outdoor movement space, which as much as they love their weekly family movie they really crave outside movement time on such a deep level that they can\'t really help but respond once you start it. And we\'ll be out there for 45 minutes. And this is mid-movie. Mid-movie that they were super into but when you\'re whole family is out there or your friends, or your bird friends, or whatever else is going on and you kind of engage in nature, like we\'ll come back sometimes an hour later and sit down to finish our movie. And I do the same thing on kind of wintry or what I call cozy days when it\'s really hard to break the coziness of inside to go outside. \xa0So I\'ll just create a recess where it\'s like, ""We need to go make a nature bouquet."" Or ""We need to go do this in the garden."" Or ... or or or... come up with your own scenario. The point is that you see your home in the same way that you would want your teachers at school to be giving your children access to outside. That you\'re facilitating what you want them to do in the same way in the space of your own home. So. Why do we need a full hour of recess?', ""ANGELA: \xa0Children are already sitting for hours at a time. They start to get antsy. And so their activity levels starts to get a little bit higher. And when you let them outside, let's say you only get 20 minutes for recess, your activity level will actually go up first before it regulates back down. So children need a full 45 minutes to an hour for that activity level to regulate itself so they can be calm and grounded and be able to pay attention."", 'KATY: Uh-huh.', ""ANGELA: The other issue with only having short recess sessions is it takes time to figure out who you're gonna play with, what you're gonna play, and then to play out that play scheme. \xa0So, again, 15-20 minute recess sessions is never enough time to get into deeper play. And so children often resort to playing tag or playing on play structures. But we're missing that creative play which is so important for social development."", 'KATY: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense because I think that sometimes we think of kids\' needs of movement as encroaching on what we need to do. And so it\'s like, ""Oh look the kids are full up on what they can take academically let\'s let them out and let them run off their fidgety so they can sit back down to learn more of what we want to teach them, versus, seeing movement as learning. I think that that\'s the biggest piece that\'s missing.', 'ANGELA; Yeah. \xa0And sometimes when the children come back in, actually a lot of times they\'re more hyper than before and so teachers are getting frustrated with recess saying ""Well why bother.""', 'KATY: Right. Because the actual shape of the recess is not the right shape.', 'ANGELA: Yeah. Right.', 'ANGELA: My second action item is to allow children to move in ways that make adults gasp. \xa0So, essentially what I\'m saying is, allowing kids to go upside down on monkey bars, to jump off a swing if they want to, to climb trees to heights that might make us a little nervous, to spin in circles \'til they fall on the ground, that sort of thing. Because those are the type of movements that are gonna help organize the brain. \xa0Frequently I will see an adult say, ""don\'t spin, you\'re gonna get dizzy"" but ...', ""KATY: \xa0That's the point!"", 'ANGELA: \xa0When they\'re spinning their neurological system is really trying to organize that sense. And so if we constantly say ""no, be careful, stop"" then we become the barrier to child development. \xa0So we actually need to allow more opportunities for kids to move in different ways. Because if we don\'t they\'re gonna become more and more unsafe.', 'KATY: Right. \xa0Well, my action item would be then: adults need to start moving in ways that make other adults gasp and make sure that there are children watching and you can watch the children watching break out in joyful smiles and run over to try something similar - maybe scaled to their own level. And I think that, as you were talking about so much of the ""be careful. Don\'t do that"" or ""watch out"" ...', 'ANGELA: Right.', ""KATY: There used to be so much more of that. \xa0And I'm interested in sedentary culture as a whole and I think that as a whole the grown-ups themselves are receding from those challenging movements and then their perspective is that they're dangerous. \xa0Like I have had so many adults who don't spend a lot of time out moving in complex or challenging ways stop my kids in doing the nature exploring, physically complex thing by telling them that they can't do it - as they're doing it. Or to start listing the reasons why that would be bad. And then over time it just, you get a whole group where nobody can do that thing. \xa0So..."", 'ANGELA: \xa0Yes.', 'KATY: you know, grown-ups on playgrounds or just to start challenging yourself. If you\'ve... I get a lot of people asking me as I\'m sure you do, ""how do I get my kids to move more?"" The number one, the first thing I would say, is start moving more yourself and doing it in front of your kids. Get a gymnastics mat. Put it in your backyard and you start practicing somersaults. You start practicing cartwheels and handstands. \xa0And if you need to do the preparatory moves to get there, I mean, that\'s what I do, to help people get to explore some of those more complex spaces. But if you do it yourself and especially when you can do stuff - like I love doing cartwheels with a group of kids. We\'ll go to a park and I will do one and there\'s a flock of kids all of a sudden around you because you\'re doing this thing. Yeah. You moving more - number one way to get other kids moving more. \xa0And that also kind of shows, I think the kids pick up more on modeling than on instruction.', 'ANGELA: Yeah.', ""KATY: And I've talked about it on other podcast episodes. And it would be interesting, Angela, to hear your take on it where a kid's job is to play. You can really find that in many traditional cultures. Certainly hunter/gatherer cultures where they don't see children as really needing to participate in the work of the grown-ups, I guess, of the culture. They're playing. But, the play that they do is all playful versions of skills that they will call on..."", 'ANGELA: Yes.', ""KATY: ...as grownups. So that's where I like to clarify play. That there's knowledge that is in play. And when grown-ups can be playful using their body for stuff that we need, then your kid wants to pop out next to you and for them, it's play because there's no right or wrong way to do it. They don't have to have any particular outcome. They can stop when they're tired. They can stay, maybe their play of me digging because I had to do something turns into them looking at bugs and then I move on but they're still there with the bugs 47 minutes later. Or filling a hole with water or whatever they're doing. But if you can use your body to do movement things that bring you joy then they will slowly pick up on those through modeling. \xa0And not in that classic activity instruction time."", 'ANGELA: Absolutely. Environment is huge. The big piece of the issue, I guess, at ', "" our environment is a huge influencer. It's a little different here because there's no adults. I mean the adults are really - there are adults and they're supervising - but they're really stepping back and observing for most of the time. \xa0We're only there for safety so we'll go up and we'll intervene but the other children there - we have mixed ages on purpose - the other children are inspiration to do things. So there might be a child that's very afraid to get dirty and they'll see other kids in the mud puddle catching frogs and that is enough for them to overcome their fear and get in because of that modeling piece that you're talking about. So I do believe that there's a huge component to modeling too, \xa0from the parenting perspective in the home environment. And I think there's great value to playing with our children. And there's great value to also giving them time where we kind of step back and allow them to play with other kids and see what they come up with. But that environment piece is huge."", ""ANGELA: \xa0So the third tip is to inspire big body play outdoors. You know I've seen a lot of fairy houses or scavenger hunt type things but I think, you know, again using that environment for inspiration is pretty powerful and it can really empower kids to come up with their own ideas. Which is becoming an issue more and more. Where we're actually seeing kids that come to our program that have no idea how to play. And it's very sad because like we were talking about, it's their occupation - of a child is play. So thinking big, if you want to inspire big body play, you would instead of ... you know with fairy houses you have little loose parts or materials that they can move around. But with big body play, you want to think big tires, planks, that sort of thing. Bricks. Things that engage the muscles and give resistance to their movement will inspire building, constructing, and you see play come alive at a bigger scale. So that would be one of my tips. And I think that we often think of toys, like you know, our first instinct is to provide toys outside for children. But I think there's a lot of value to bringing loose parts to the outdoor environment even at home. You know, like even putting baskets outside but not necessarily having anything in them, can be enough for a child to be inspired to do something with a basket. So it really just is a prop. It's a mode for inspiration to play. \xa0So just really being creative with that."", ""KATY: We went to a concert this summer outside and the people who were hosting the concert had provided the game Jenga - which I think of as a fine motor skill, right? Your stacking and you're removing. But it was full sized Jenga. So they were cut 2 x 4s. So you were squatting and picking up things and darting out of the way when the whole thing was crashing and getting up and walking around and I think if I can just clarify..."", 'ANGELA: Sure.', ""KATY: Big body you mean basically the opposite of fine motor. So instead of building a fairy house where you're moving your wrists and you're moving your fingers, and having this delicate balance, you are squatting, picking up things that are a little bit more heavy... \xa0There's another school here in our town that their playground - I think this is key - they don't keep it out all the time. They pull things off their playground area and put them back seasonally and monthly so that it's always fresh and always inspiring. But they have big pieces of lumber out there."", 'ANGELA: Yeah.', ""KATY: And the kids just start dragging and grabbing and building and they'll just come up with stuff that you could never ever come up with any other time. \xa0And that's what you mean by big body, right?"", ""ANGELA: Right. So the kids out during free play, the older kids especially, they'll create whole societies out there. So they'll have stores, they'll have trading posts where it's safe to trade. They'll be lugging tires back and forth for currency. But they're just engaging all of the muscles and the senses. \xa0Climbing up boulders to bring things up there. And it's stuff that you, as a therapist, it's like six months worth of therapy in a week that you see out there."", ""KATY: Right. Right. \xa0And I think that, too, it's so important. We're talking about less. \xa0And I think that there's a lot of discussion around nature and movement and natural movement being accessible. And one element of accessibility is about money. \xa0A lot of it is about time and a lot of other social factors. But for so many, like even starting a program. Even I've worked with a lot of occupational therapists and physical therapists who, you know you open up an office and you have to buy all the equipment to move the arms and the legs or you can set up more of a green space office where your whole entire therapeutic setup could potentially be almost free, right? \xa0Especially if you're using green spaces that have small shelters or whatever. These are inexpensive things for most people that provide even more than what their more expensive counterpart offers."", 'ANGELA: \xa0Absolutely. For instance, one of those sensory balance beams usually cost between two and three hundred dollars.', 'KATY: How much is a two by four?', ""ANGELA: \xa0Right. Exactly. And or you could go on a log which - it's free, you know?"", ""KATY: Right. \xa0Well ok, so my tip for this is: alter your environment to make big body play outdoors. \xa0And I would add it even indoors. Like to make it occur naturally. And so this means making changes to what's in your yard or in whatever play space you have or change how often you are going into spaces where big body play is better supported. \xa0\xa0I was thinking on this because I'm currently working with a school to design these spaces for both their outside and their inside - to have their classroom furniture facilitate big body play. What you call big body play - I've never used that term before. It's a great term. \xa0And one of the things I've noticed through a lot of research is, schools, not all but most, are already set up, they already own lots of green spaces."", 'ANGELA: Yeah.', 'KATY: But most of all the green spaces that are owned by schools are barely utilized. \xa0I mean a fraction of the time and I feel sometimes educational models are challenging to shift because money is such a big deal.', 'ANGELA: And time.', ""KATY: Money and time. Well so, like money's a big deal ..."", 'ANGELA: Yep.', ""KATY: ... because there's no budget to add anything else. Right. Ok. So how can we then leverage the fact that your school is already 20-50% green space? \xa0It's already there. That space is already there. What happens is there's not a lot of lessons that are given through the filter of movement. And I was just thinking - I had a great physics teacher who taught so much of our physics classroom outside. We would actually go to stadium stairs and generate our own horsepower. Like we would get the timer, we figured out the height and then we would run it and then we would see if our horsepower changed over time - if we could do other things. So I think that there is a huge amount of education. So I think on one hand there's this idea that you are bringing up that has been brought up in vitamin nature and Richard Louv books and in some of our nature school podcasts where learning can be the by-product of just physically engaging with your environment - with your natural environment. Because a large part of curriculum is basically just natural knowledge. We call it science. But it's science - it's the knowledge of what's happening around you - the other things, the living things. \xa0So if you get out there and you're fortunate enough to be in a space where you can, like you said, go to the river and pull out the frog or see what happens when you dig a hole and watch the path of the water move, those are all things that we reduce to equations in textbooks and they don't have very much natural context. We don't understand always that these are things happening in the world. They seem more like things that are happening in a book, inside a classroom and my job is to read it and pass the test and then be successful as a grown-up. Right?"", 'ANGELA: Right.', ""KATY: So there's this idea of extending play because learning can happen in that context. At the same time, for people, for all of us who have to transition this model that we have of the education that we all need to hold, is that we could take curriculum that we've already decided to be valuable and add movement to it. So those are two different approaches that I think are moving towards the same set of problems, right? So if you feel like free play at a certain point, if you got that, if you're able to facilitate that, then folks that are doing the traditional academics if they could start thinking in terms of adding more movement - big body movement - natural movement, big body movement in nature - to the curriculum, now we're moving. Now we're moving quickly because we're on both sides of the problem at the same time. \xa0And I have so many ideas of how to do this. So if anyone out there ever wants to do an entire academic school based around movement, then you should call me."", 'ANGELA: Yeah.', ""KATY: Don't call me. Never mind. It's the way of the future but the future is now. I mean I don't think there's any more delay."", ""ANGELA: It's happening."", ""KATY: It's happening. It needs to happen now."", 'ANGELA: Definitely.', ""KATY: \xa0Well is there anything else that we should ... I'm going to link to your Washington Post piece. And I will link to your post that went viral. \xa0That came out before your book, right? Or did it come out right about the same time?"", ""ANGELA: No it came out before the book. Why kids can't sit still ... something like that."", ""KATY: Well we'll link to both of them so you can get the sense of Angela's work. It's really great. \xa0I have one more question: Can people become "", ' instructors? \xa0Or if a school wanted to add that element to their school do they go and train with TimberNook and then are able to come back and offer it? \xa0Is that how that works?', ""ANGELA: So the model that's opening up in 2019 is that schools can become certified to do "", ' programming in the school. So that will come out in January or February of 2019.', ""KATY: Well it's interesting because there's a tremendous amount of research and data on children and moving and academics and nature time and well-being and therapy and ... getting it to take action is the problem. \xa0The understanding of it is not problematic. It's there. It's understood. Changing the paradigm, that seems to be the missing piece."", 'ANGELA: Yeah.', 'KATY: \xa0But I have heard at various conferences now that everyone kind of understands that this outdoor education and play space is really kind of a foundational requirement...', 'ANGELA: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: ...for children which are just future adults, to be well.', ""ANGELA: \xa0Yeah. It's becoming a law for some states to add play back into the curriculum."", ""KATY: Yes. But the problem seems to be or the holdup seems to be there's not enough adults with outdoor movement play skills to lead the children."", 'ANGELA: Absolutely.', ""KATY: That's the issue. It's like now that we have an understanding there's no support for grown-ups who then have to take these jobs. So I really see things like your program filling a huge niche. People who are starting nature school trainings, my role is to help physical resiliency and comfort in movement - in moving through nature. MovNat - becoming movement teachers. These are all tools to the same end which is to make those who are kind of in charge of the children more suitable to lead them in the direction that we now know we should be going, kind of as a group of humans."", 'ANGELA: \xa0So way cool.', ""KATY: It's super cool. So thank you for writing so much and putting those ideas out there."", 'ANGELA: \xa0Thank you, Katy.', 'KATY: Angela Hanscom.

I have two books on feet that came out pretty close together and we were always talking about - I mean I feel like we talk an inordinate amount about footwear on my social media channels specifically, minimal footwear. Someone else had shared, I think when your company might have been just starting they said, ""Have you ever heard of these?"" I\'m from California. I had never really owned rain boots or winter gear my whole life and then we moved to the pacific northwest. Our kids were going to nature preschool and they were maybe 3 and 4 and someone forwarded a link to your company at it was finally exactly what we needed which was, gear that had these minimal footwear principles.', ""So, I shared it wide. And I'm sure everyone else was excited as I was. But I would like to know, how did "", "" get started. What made you start making your... how would you describe them...they're not rainboots you said.

And when we say all purpose we mean that because of the materials they\'re made of, they\'re super lightweight, they\'re really flexible, they\'re easily packable, they can pack really tight so you can take them traveling or back camping or just anywhere out with you. The whole idea behind them was to allow kids to get outside without being impeded by their clunky footwear. \xa0And I\'ll be honest. I actually come from a legal background and my partner, my husband, comes from the animated movie industry. So neither one of us really fell into this because of experience but rather true necessity. Both he and I are huge outdoor people and have grown up since a very young age in the mountains, skiing, hiking, camping with our own families. Him in Argentina and me here in Canada. And so when our youngest son, we have two sons, my youngest son Rio started walking at a really early age, he wasn\'t even 10 months old yet, we literally could not find any boots for him to wear outside that would first of all fit his feet and second of all that his little chubby legs could actually lift up. The only things we could find where your traditional rubber boots. And as cute as they were, he was doing face plants into every single puddle he was trying to jump into because he just couldn\'t lift his feet off the ground. And I started asking around to all my momma friends on the playground, because I had left law at that point and asked, ""You know there\'s gotta be something that he can wear outside that doesn\'t make him trip."" \xa0And nobody had any options for us. So that\'s when we went ""well, you know there\'s this gap in the market. Why isn\'t anyone filling it."" So after a lot of hemming and hawing, we started looking into is this possible. Is this feasible? How could we design something that would be more practical, more useful, and better for kids to wear? And after lots of discussion we took the plunge in 2013. We took the plunge and started MyMayu. So it was really a product of necessity more than anything. It\'s just nobody was making anything for kids and so we decided we should do it ourselves. A little bit of a crazy idea but here we are four years after debuting our first boot and things have really really grown and not in small part to you. So thank you for sharing.', 'KATY: Well, you\'re welcome. And it is a huge... it\'s a huge oversight. And then I see it more from the movement side. We have a nature school here. So I see families come to nature education and they\'re not thinking movement. THey\'re just thinking academics outside. And I teach movement in a lot of different ways. Not everyone knows that I teach it also locally in different groups and so I\'ll work sometimes with parents and they will - they\'re like just look at my kid as they\'re going into the forest. They\'re just not very coordinated. There\'s a lot of myths, I think, around how children move awkwardly and stumble because they don\'t have all of their coordination yet. And these parents are saying, ""my kids are - their balance is so poor and they\'re slipping all the time and they don\'t want to go for long walks"" and meanwhile this kid has got this stiff boot that allows no ankle flexion. It\'s so thick that they can\'t feel what\'s underneath. It\'s made out of very slick rubber, sometimes, with no traction. And I feel like this isn\'t your child that you\'re seeing. This is your child in this particular -- they\'re heavy, you know, relative to the weight of their segments. And so I really like to begin the school year and back to school footwear shopping time by saying everything that you\'re adding to your kids\' body is informing, and to our bodies frankly, is informing our movement and the way that we move. And so when we think of how things are, it\'s just a piece of gear that maybe isn\'t quite right. \xa0For people who live in wet, rainy areas, your boots have been amazing. We are on our, probably our 6th or 7th pair at this time. So I appreciate what you are doing but, I have just heard that you are also going to start ', "" and I just want to know if that's true or not."", ""SUZANNE: That is true. \xa0So since we started this, I mean I hate traditional rubber boots. They're not comfortable for me. I had a bad car accident in the early 2000s that screwed up my back. Which really got me thinking more about as you say movement, how I move, how I sit, what I'm wearing on my feet. \xa0And I just found too, as I age, I need things that are more minimal. I just feel better. And traditional rubber boots are... I hate them. They're horrid. But in, as you say, in the Pacific Northwest, here in North Vancouver Canada, you need something in the winter. The fall/winter/spring. I mean three seasons at least. To protect your feet and keep them somewhat dry and somewhat warm from the elements. So I am so excited about our "", "". We're launching our "", "" and I am just so excited about them. We're launching with two different styles. One is more unisex and it's a little bit lower on the leg. And then one goes all the way up to the knee and is more feminine. So I imagine more women will buy it. But both of them have the same principles. They're super lightweight. They're flexible. It's basically the grown-up version of the kids' boots. And we're just so excited. I just can't wait. I'm sure you can hear it in my voice."", ""KATY: \xa0I know. I know. And that's a huge shift. I can't even imagine what that would be like. It would be like me adding kids' programs. It's like doubling the work that you're doing. "", 'SUZANNE: It changes the dynamic of the company but in the same vein it doesn\'t. Because from day one we have really been more about getting families, getting people outside. And that\'s our motto. \xa0Is just be outside. And I firmly believe it that. Because every time I\'m having a bad day and I\'m in my head, the best thing for me to do - and I did it even yesterday with my young son Rio, is to get outside. It was raining, we were cooped up. Nobody was happy. And I just grabbed his hand and I said, ""Look, we\'re going for a walk."" \xa0And just going for that 45-minute walk outside, getting our blood pumping, we had some alone time together. It just it really is about that. So our gear, each and every time we put something new out there, we change something with the boots or we add a product to our product line, there\'s this real conscious decision when we\'re making those changes, those design element changes, we\'re introducing a new product is: is this going to help people get outside and enjoy nature more? \xa0Because I used to look at playgrounds, and I still do even at my son\'s school. I call them boot battlefields. I\'m sure you\'ve seen the number of parents who actually carry their children\'s big clunky rubber boots and the children are running around in the rain in their running shoes because they\'re lighter weight and they\'re easier to run in and that\'s what they want to play in. They don\'t want to be clomping around in big boots. And adults don\'t either. So, we need to get them on adults as well.', ""KATY: And I think that's why I love all of you in the collective. You're all makers. You're all making products. But no one's end goal was to start a shoe company. It was always to solve a problem. It was to make movement in all these cases more accessible. More natural movement, more movement in nature, more nature time, more family time. And that to me is just ... it's such a beautiful perspective to launch a company from because I think it resonates. I can feel it on your website and the way you do customer service and the way that you talk about your products. So again just highlighting that not all products are the same because the intention behind them is different. \xa0I would like everyone to know that you support our local non-profit kids in nature organization. So I wanted to thank you on behalf of the Olympic Nature Experience because I'm on the board there. But what do you most want people to know about "", "" that maybe they don't?"", ""SUZANNE: THat's a really good question. I think really what I would like most people to know about "", ' is we really are a small, family company that has big dreams and the best intentions. And so not everything goes well in your first innovation of products. Sometimes it takes a while to learn things. \xa0And we learned a lot over the last 4 years. You know, manufacturing is an entirely different beast. My husband and I each bring our own unique set of talents and strengths to our company but basically I run this while my sons are at school and then we do more when they\'re in bed. And we\'re working super hard. And you know sometimes we don\'t get things perfect. I have taught my sons from the beginning there\'s no such thing as perfect but we do intend and strive to put the best thing out there that we possibly can. And each time that there\'s a new iteration and there\'s tweaks and designs, we take all of the feedback from our customers. \xa0You know I take ... criticism is a way to improve. It\'s the opportunity to make things better. And so when people reach out and say, ""You know, I didn\'t really like this aspect of it. Have you thought about changing it?"" I welcome that. Because we don\'t know everything. We\'re just trying to get kids and families and adults outside and enjoying things without really having to consciously think about what\'s on their feet. So that\'s what I really would like people to know about ', "". We're here. We're doing our best and we just want to help you get outside and enjoy nature. \xa0Because I truly do believe that nature heals pretty much anything."", 'K', ""ATY: I just have one more question that just occurred to me: \xa0What's a Mayu."", ""SUZANNE: \xa0So, as I said, our youngest son, Rio, was the reason for creating these boots. \xa0And so Rio, meaning river. We have this logo that has the two M's. We started off the company calling it Muddy Munchkin. \xa0And I'll be honest there was a big shoe company that had some problems with the word Munchkin. So, in the end, we agreed with this big shoe conglomerate just for our line of boots but that we would have to call our company something else. So we liked the logo mark. We liked the little critters, the two Ms. \xa0And so we had to come up with something else. Luckily for us, the Quechua word for river is Mayu. So "", ""was this singsongy, still had the two M's and it actually fits a lot better. And I really like it. Some people have a hard time pronouncing it, but it really works for us. And Quechua also being - it's an ancient language. It was spoken by the Incas and my husband being South American. It was like all these stars aligned. And in the end I'm actually grateful that we had to change our name because I think "", "" speaks more about our company. It's more with the flow. The flow of a river. We go with the flow. It's got that water element that's important to all of our family. We like to live by the water. We're kiteboarders. We like to surf even if it's poorly. \xa0So all of these different elements came in and that's where "", ' came from.', 'KATY: Suzanne Solsona is the founder and CEO of ', ' which is M A Y U for any of those out there wondering.

Welcome to the Katy Says podcast. This is the ninth in a series of special episodes we call Between the Lines: where Katy Bowman and Stephanie Domet explore the deeper messages in, and connections between Katy's books. "", 'KATY: I am Katy Bowman, biomechanist and author of ', '.', ""STEPHANIE: And I am Stephanie Domet, a chronically curious writer and radio journalist. So, Katy, you're in our hemisphere..."", 'KATY: Right.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0in North America where you and I both are. We're at the beginning of Autumn now, but you are soon to head to New Zealand and will arrive into Spring. What's exciting to you about getting a second spring this year and what will you miss experiencing of Autumn."", ""KATY: I'm glad you asked me in that order. \xa0I have jam-packed fall as much as I could into the little bit of time that I am here. A lot of pumpkin. I have roasted a lot of pumpkin. I harvested all my winter squash and I dried the measly sub-par ears of corn that I was able to grow. So it's that. It is, you know what, I can feel my body slowing down. At the end of summer, I always look forward to the cooler winter. The way of walking through fall, there's certain fall hikes that we take. So I'm going to miss that. I'm going to miss the fact that I'm on a natural rhythm that's going to get abruptly switched back over to ramping back up. And so my biggest concern, I mean obviously I'm thrilled about the trip, but my biggest concern is ... last year instead of a Christmas tree, we got goji berry vines."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0\xa0Yes.', ""KATY: And we brought them into the house. I know. \xa0We wanted to get something that we could replant that was kind of different and fun to decorate and that's what we did. But when we brought it into the house they were already dormant. They had already gone dormant for the winter."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: So my brother in law who is a, I don\'t know what he is, just an expert in all plant things, he said ""you\'re gonna have to transition it back. Because it\'s already dormant and when you bring it into your house and it\'s sitting in this warm home, it\'s going to think it\'s spring and it\'s going to start sending energy and it might even start budding."" \xa0Which one of them did towards the end. He said, ""you can\'t just put it back outside. \xa0You have to transition it back in stages so that it senses that winter has come back on."" Because it doesn\'t have really a duration meter. It doesn\'t have a clock inside of it. It has a thermostat.', ""KATY: So it's responding to the temperature signals. \xa0So I am like that. People are like that. We all have so many signals that are in tune with the biorhythm, and obviously, they're adaptable and changeable. We travel between seasons probably all the time. But because I'm very aware of how my body works and when my body works and where I am in the natural cycle of things, I'm interested to see what my version of rebudding is. \xa0Meaning like I've already transitioned in some things. I'm going to basically be, I'm going to have to pull up sources of energy that I've already let go and that plant that rebudded..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: ... didn't fruit. Because it had taken that energy and displaced it to pushing off leaves that fell off that had to then grow again. \xa0So that, it didn't have it. So it's gonna mess me up for the year. In some capacity, there's going to be a pull of energy. And I have the luxury of offsetting it maybe with food or whatever, but I also think it's more than just an energetic balance. I'm going to abruptly transition and who knows all the parts of my body that have come and gone to deal with seasons and I've never done this before. So that is both what I'm looking forward to doing and what I am reticent about it. In a nutshell. So that's what's on my mind: documenting it, observing it and documenting it and then also being it. You know, all three separate activities."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: So basically it's like a..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I will look forward to hearing about the other side for sure.', 'KATY: What was my fruit loss? \xa0It\'s like, ""oh, I would have..."" \xa0So basically I\'m gonna lose a book. I feel like basically I\'m not gonna be able to do a book. I might be a sub-par parent for six months. Who knows. \xa0I don\'t know. \xa0I\'ll muster.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0You operate at a pretty high level. You could probably take it down by about 50% and no one would really notice.', 'KATY: I could probably lose a few fruits?', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah, I think so. \xa0Still come up ok.', 'KATY: Then I feel good about it.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0There you go.', 'KATY: Thanks for the reframe.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah, no problem. I can always be counted on for that. \xa0But it's interesting, of course, that the thing that we would talk about in the context of this is about the natural world. That's where we always seem to get to in our conversations. And for the next couple of episodes of this podcast we'll be talking about "", "" - Essays on Movement Science, Movement Ecology, and the Nature of Movements ... of Movement rather. \xa0And, of course, one of the key aspects of this book is nature. And so I thought we ought to spend an entire episode really digging into why nature matters so much to what you're putting forward in this book. \xa0Okay?"", 'KATY: Okay.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0So, Katy, when you began working on ', ' did you have an idea of the intrinsic role that nature would play in the development and articulation of the ideas that you were planning to write about?', 'KATY: Oh. \xa0No. \xa0No. That was a discovery. Like I did not sit down ... I mean I wrote ', ' which is about natural movements which had a certain amount of nature-y things in it. \xa0But I mean I don\'t really feel particularly qualified to write about nature. \xa0It\'s not like...nature, ironically. Ironically I say ironically because science is supposed to be really the pursuit of understanding nature. So when you have a training in a science that reduces nature as the context, that was the biggest revelation for me through writing this book. It\'s ok, ""oh, yes, of course!"" \xa0I\'m even working with quote ""natural laws"" but the examples that you\'re dealing with are outside of that, what we\'ve given the word nature to. So no, it was a surprise how much of this book ended up being about quote ""nature.""', ""KATY: That old question! \xa0Well, I don't know because remember it was a set... you've written. \xa0You understand how these things rattle around."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Oh yes.', ""KATY: And they spin around. \xa0I thought that the book was going to be ... the book was just a series of essays that I had already written explaining really that scale matters. \xa0You know, I think the, we've talked about this before, where it was originally a series of blog posts, kind of like Alignment Matters."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right. It was supposed to be the bookend piece.', 'KATY: Yeah. But those articles in particular were really about like, ""Hey, we\'re kind of looking at a narrow point of view when we\'re looking at this."" \xa0I had written, I had done a dissection of an orange and dissected it because the pictures were amazing. \xa0But really like showed, here\'s a whole orange But when you take this off well here\'s a whole orange. \xa0But you take off these pieces, but this orange slice is made up of these pieces. Because it just keeps getting smaller and smaller so I had to do a lot of explaining about scale and how things change when you\'re looking at a single piece of them versus something more integrated. \xa0That\'s what those blog posts were about. And as I said before I didn\'t particularly see a theme other than, ""hey, models get more complex"". \xa0But I hadn\'t really tied it to movement yet. So I didn\'t even really know that movement matters. I mean ', "", the name, they come after. You name a book at the end. \xa0You don't even..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: \xa0...you don't think of a title and be like I'm gonna write a book about this. You're just writing. \xa0It's a very...now I realize oh, this is art. \xa0Like this is a, you don't know what the tapestry is going to end up looking like and so I thought I was gonna write a book. I knew it was gonna be about movement. And I thought it was going to be about understanding that the scale of movement mattered when considering it. But that was about it. \xa0I didn't realize the role that nature would play in the book."", 'KATY: Yeah, you know what, talking about multi-tasking, I\'m thinking as I\'m listening to you. Because I\'m still thinking of your last question. So I think the way, you know I talk about natural movement so the conversation goes: \xa0""What do you do?"" \xa0""Oh, I kind of think about and write about and teach natural movement."" ""Well, what\'s natural movement?"" \xa0And the quick answer is, ""Oh natural movements are all those movements we would do were we still living in nature."" \xa0And most people, like sprinting, walking long distances, crawling, or climbing, or walking on varied surfaces, like that\'s kind of like the nutshell of it. \xa0But there was an article, and so this is kind of the evolution of this idea. You know I synthesize pieces that are sometimes really far apart in time for me. But that piece that I held from two years ago when combined with something new, synthesizes and then I\'m able to leap forward pretty quickly. Because maybe it was an open-ended question or whatever. So I remember reading an article that Erwan Le Corre wrote. I don\'t even remember what it was about. Erwan Le Corre started MovNat. And it was about talking about fitness that didn\'t look like your same kind of rigid fitness, you know, that he was, his retreats he was teaching crawling. And then there was this picture of this whole group of people. I think they were crawling uphill. And it looked like they were going crawling for a mile. Like they were doing this thing. The part that stuck out to me was this comment of someone saying, ""That\'s great but that\'s not, like, we don\'t need to crawl anymore. We\'ve already changed, we\'re upright now. There\'s no reason to go back and practice quadruped or less evolved forms of us movement.""', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Ah-ha.', ""KATY: That was the sentiment of the comment. I have stopped reading comments since then. \xa0Just kidding. But you know you just kind of pick up things. And for some reason, I'm a firm believer that as you read through things in the world the parts that you need to know your very wise brain pulls them out for you. It just sets them there like a banner."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: So I just have lots of those that are just floating around. But then maybe, oh gosh, maybe like three years later is when I found out about conflict minerals. \xa0', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Ah-ha.', 'KATY: \xa0Do you know what conflict minerals are?', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm. \xa0They're the things that are in our smart phones and devices and things with batteries..."", 'KATY: Yes.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0And wars are fought over them in places far away.', ""KATY: Yes. I read a small article on conflict... I was sitting in a Whole Foods to use the bathroom, I remember, we came in, we rushed in and it was sitting there folded up. It was a USA Today. I feel like I have to disclaimer. It was a USA today and the article was folded open to this tiny thing on conflict minerals. And I had never heard of it. \xa0And as I'm reading through it, the fact that these wars in these places were waged, like that's how it was presented. These wars are waged over these minerals that in some locations have become basic essentials for every household member. And yet they're these things that, kind of like a blood diamond. Essentially like a blood diamond but it's a mineral."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Exactly. Yeah.', 'KATY: So they\'re likening it to that. And I was like, ""What? No way."" I couldn\'t believe that it would be in this... to me this kind of thing should be front lines. I was very naive at the time. I was like, ""Well why wouldn\'t this be on the headline."" Surely everyone\'s not gonna want to be participating in this. So I did a little bit more research into it and found that, yes, the wars and these situations were horrible but inside of that circle were the fact that the labor of the people actually having to get them were essentially crawling...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Huh.', 'KATY: ...the bulk of the day and mining by hand and digging around in forced, you know, often slave conditions. Children, 6 years old, and so, you know, that had one, of course, affect on me personally but was unrelated to my job teaching natural movement. But then the more I thought about those two things side by side, or the more my brain worked on them or however this whole things works, was like, ""Ok, the fact that we\'re not crawling is not because our bodies don\'t need it anymore or don\'t need it anymore because there are human beings right now who are actually crawling, you know, hours a day for these things that we all need. For the necessities."" So I think I just started to work on it from that going, ""ok, yes, these are moves."" They\'re not the sexy hunter-gatherer moves because those are often presented as run, jump, sprint. You know, they\'re clean. \xa0They\'re not the gatherer moves. So the gatherer moves, I think, with ', ', I was like all those run, jump, sprint things that are what we are trying to call the full spectrum of natural movements are really on the back of squatting, birthing, pounding, mashing, nursing, you know, like all these less sexy or certainly less fitness-y. \xa0But the base of those is huge. So I just realized, no, there are humans all over right now, doing these so-called extinct movements but the group of them who have perceived them as extinct are the people who have outsourced them.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: \xa0Who, you know, so it all started to come in. And then I started thinking about food and then I started thinking about, ok, yeah. These are all moves that I myself would have to for my survival if someone else wasn't doing them. And then I understood nature in the, then the nature thing started to come in because you're just starting to think what are the other elements. You know it's hard to model things like natural movement because you can't perceive all of the movement that's required. But you know in this book I added temperature."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: And breastfeeding and things that I had alluded to in ', ' but really tried to flesh out here to say here\'s why talking... chewing, you know, like now we\'re at.. those are even less sexy than the other ones. They seem - they\'re so taken for granted. So that\'s how that kind of came to be. So nature, gosh then it was like human nature and then it was what is nature. Because if you\'re writing and you\'re using a word I learned in second grade you should look it up. So what is nature - when I was trying to clarify some things in biology. Talked to a lot of different people and was surprised just to hear the ... or people who hold the same level of education within a field ... how wildly varying their ideas were. And just to go ""Wow, this thing is way more malleable than I thought."" You know again, it was just being naive to the idea that we have lots of boxes around things. You know we\'re like a box of this means this definition. \xa0A box that means that definition. But everything\'s like pretty malleable. And so that\'s kind of a long way around nature. But that\'s... nature was the overall theme. Nature was the stopping point. I was like, ok, this is what I\'m talking about. I\'m talking about how are humans in nature. What is nature? \xa0And then in getting that point, I feel like that then became a huge portion of the book if not the main thread or the main theme if you will.Certainly.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm. \xa0It's absolutely the underpinning. And I'm interested in where we ended up because definitely you write about everything is nature. We are part of nature. But you also do sort of have to make that distinction in the book that humans, especially in the west, are largely living outside what we tend to think of as nature."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0And we have to make that distinction, I guess, in order to really dig into the ideas that you're digging into."", ""KATY: Well, I mean I was doing an interview and someone had said, that's where I kind of first tuned into like well everything is nature. I mean, like how, like you have to define nature by something and so I think a lot of times nature is defined \xa0- it's like, some people define nature as green spaces. If there are trees it's nature-y."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Or if there is a lake, it's nature. It's like how it looks."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah. Right.', ""KATY: And then some people define nature by the fact that it's been broken down and reassembled makes it less nature-y. Right? If it's intact with how the earth produced it without intervention, it's nature. And if it's been broken down and reassembled, it's not nature."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right. A cultivated garden.', ""KATY: Right or like a house is not nature, even though it's made out of things from nature."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: But if we\'re talking about a beaver\'s dam... I was actually in an interview that never got released because I\'m sure that the agenda that they were interviewing me for was not served by this ""well but then again."" Like as people know when they\'re listening, I process verbally is Q&A is my number one way of processing. So thank you for everyone who has ever asked a question. I just spat out in the middle of a very... I really don\'t want to say what the source was. \xa0And I was like but by that definition, a beaver dam is not nature. \xa0And then because it\'s things that are broken down, chewed down, taken down and put up into something new. A new structure that the earth did not spring forth from the earth.', ""KATY: So we consider a certain amount of process to be natural and at the end when I actually went to look up the definitions it's simply that humans do it. \xa0"", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Humans do it - not natural. If they are creating or breaking down. And then I was like well that's not, from a mathematics ... in biology that could be fine. But from a mathematical perspective, it's way too loose. "", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Okay.', ""KATY: So then I started to go well ok, well that's ... but we would consider birthing a natural process. I had to figure out what the actual breakdown was. Because obviously that humans do it does not make it natural or unnatural. \xa0And then I started to go, well, obviously everything's scalable and we've talked about this before. \xa0So if you, you know, hunt a deer..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: ... and process the deer and the movement nourishes you in processing it. The food - you can subsist, your family is nourished by it and you take that hide and you process it into shoes that cover your feet. Those shoes are technology. Right?', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: It\'s the same thing as a beaver dam. And I think there\'s a scale at which a lot of people would say, ""Well that\'s natural, right there."" \xa0The thing that happened right there that\'s nature. That\'s closer to what a beaver does making a dam than you know building a hotel in Cancun. \xa0Or, let\'s just keep it easy. Or make a pair of shoes...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Me going to the mall and buying a pair of shoes.', ""KATY: \xa0Yes. Or like even to say the manufacturing standpoint of the shoe. So like, eventually, the way I could make sense of it with my brain that has to make sure that it's not squishy. Like there's got to be some boundaries around definitions for mathematics for my sake to be able to assign something to a category, it was about the amount of wake. Of destruction. How many things were displaced because of it. \xa0You know? \xa0And my definition might change over time but right now that's how I'm really thinking about it. It's like, you walking around outside and getting the deer and getting the thing... it's different than, you know, an entire factory that's harvesting. And that's not even, like we could scale it down to a single pair of shoes. "", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: You would see maybe that the displacement of the earth took place in 17 different places and involved 13 extra people. Like where this scale of agitation is a lot larger.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: There was a direct exchange between the few living things and the footprint. So that's when I started talking about - we have to kind of understand footprints. \xa0The footprints of that, of that shoe, ironically, is smaller than the footprint of the other shoe. So it has to do more with the rate and then everyone wants to assign, usually, a good/bad. And I try to say I don't know if there are any good or bads. \xa0Because this might be the nature of humans, to create and create and create. I've seen kids in Lego. I can see that. If you give them things - you can break things down into a regular shape, they can create new things. So it's kind of hard to talk about what's natural or not natural. This is obviously natural. \xa0But what happens... so I had to start talking about it as a response and sustainability. It's like ok, well we can say that this is all natural that's happening. Now we can talk that if it's all natural that must mean it's all good and the way that we use the term. So then how do we make choices? \xa0Because obviously there's something that we're after and in some cases, it could be your personal well being that is a scaleable for you. In other cases, it could be the fact that other people are involved that would influence you that you to want to scale it. Or maybe it's the ecosystem that you'd want to minimize - the impact of what you're fashioning or what you're requiring being fashioned. \xa0And so that's what I had to do in "", "" to be able to talk about movement still as something that a human needs. Whether or not they're doing it themselves or someone else is doing it on their behalf, they require movement to survive."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: Like that, it is part of their anatomy, if you will. It's part of my anatomy."", ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Somebody somewhere has got to move for you. \xa0Or you've got to move."", ""KATY: Yeah. Or you've got to move and sometimes other people move you. \xa0I mean there are certainly those situations and we all have phases within our life where other people moving us is part of our ecosystem and part of theirs."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yep.', ""KATY: So that is, so it's just, it got really big really fast. \xa0It went from calf stretch to nature. You know, it's like wow. That's why it's been my most challenging book because I scaled it up pretty quickly."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', ""KATY: Because there wasn't really miniature books to write in between I don't think."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0No. You needed to kind of go all into it.', ""STEPHANIE: Listen, here's my thing, though, Katy. So I am a city girl. Like through and through. \xa0I don't like camping. I'm even picky about the kinds of cabins that I will stay in. I don't like things that are gooey or creepy crawly. I don't want them touching me. And my main experience with wild animals is a seagull trying to take a sandwich out of my hands at Center Island, an amusement park I used to go to. And now figuring out how to keep raccoons out of my compost bins. So I read "", "". I see the emphasis on time in nature. The nutrients that brings; both in the food you might forage out there but also the other nutrients like texture and community and plain old nature itself. And so I wonder, am I doing it wrong? Can I continue to have a mostly arm's length relationship with what we think of as classic nature and still get what "", 'is trying to tell me.', 'KATY: Well, I think you can understand the ideas, certainly, in the book. If that\'s what you mean by ""get."" I think that you can get the ideas without actually having to be in nature. Is that what you meant by ""get"" though?', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I guess so but not really. More than that. Can I take it on? Or do I have to get over my slight nature aversion?', ""KATY: \xa0Well, you know, it depends on what your goal is. \xa0It depends on the print that you want to live by. So I mean the answer for everyone is it just depends on what we/you want.

You're not accustomed to those ways."", ""KATY: And I think what happens when you have long megadoses of that non-traditional nature or you've gone for a long time without it - I mean to me it all seems like ... it's like palate. If you've ever gone to another country you might have an aversion to that food and it's like the tastes are using a different part of your body than normal. The textures... they're using your body. So I keep trying to filter it everything through ... our perceived aversions to whatever is often just adaptations. Your aversion might be to the fact that you don't feel comfortable in it. You don't feel good in it. And that's all I offer are ways to help you develop the anatomy to be functional... f.u.n. fun and functional in nature."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0(laughs)', ""KATY: Fun - ctional. \xa0But I don't know...

We spend the bulk of our time stopping those interactions."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: We don\'t want to touch. I mean like the people... I get so many comments and they\'re like, ""Well what if I touch stinging nettle?"" \xa0Well, right now what that tells me is that your interactions with those plants is so little that you\'re reactions are very high.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', 'KATY: And then that opens up the next discussion. Are our reactions really high simply because we\'ve missed copious low dose scenarios. And so that is, though, I could write, I think that over time, if I wanted to write endless books, which I don\'t. I think people can scale this idea themselves. \xa0Is what we might have is just ... it\'s like, ""I don\'t want to do a backflip."" My niece wants to do a backflip all day long. I see that and I have no interest in doing a backflip.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Yeah.', 'KATY: I think about all the mobilities of all these little parts. I don\'t have any interest in it. It doesn\'t fit into my life. So I can get that but I could, very easily, create a program to successfully get myself to be able to do that. I have a hundred percent confidence that that could happen. And then I could create a movement program to really get me to be able to accomplish almost any physical feat. Certainly, there are limits to my capacity. But I think that there is a ton that I could be doing that if I wanted to be doing that I could create the training program for to be able to do it. And I would have to completely readjust my life to be able to get the frequencies. So it wouldn\'t be just a program, it would be a lifestyle overhaul to allow for the period of time necessary to train for it. \xa0I could write, I\'m just thinking of the questions, they\'re like ""I\'m scared of XY and Z."" \xa0And it\'s like absolutely. And I believe that your fears and resistances are probably your deepest wisdom knowing that you\'re not ready for that interaction because you couldn\'t facilitate it with your body. So to create a so - it would have a thousand steps of how to be more comfortable in nature. And I think I could do it. I mean I think maybe in my next book maybe I\'ll write a hundred ways. You know, I\'m biased. I don\'t have that particular aversion anymore. But I took myself through maybe hundreds of un-noticeable steps to me. Just being around other people who are comfortable. They make you more comfortable because they push you on your edge. \xa0W.A.S. which is the Wilderness Adventure School, Doniga Markegard, we\'re publishing her book, she went from teenager to carnivore tracker. I mean she gained skill.

Right.', ""KATY: [00:32:20] Where knowledge that's functioning in the universe is really more related to your ability to physically embody it."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh-huh.', 'KATY: Like that you can do it or do the thing. And so, our way of learning about nature is sitting in school and being shown pictures of all these things ...', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Learning the latin names...', ""KATY: Yeah. Right? Like which is just a lesson in the mindset of the people who created them and how they viewed them. That's more like an anthropology lesson and language lesson about humans than it is about the thing. That being said, you can see with the whole vitamin nature and the kids in nature movement that they're really trying to say that you have to expose your children regularly to nature if you want them to have a relationship with it. Right? It's like a language. \xa0You have to have early exposure to be fluent in something later on. It's all the same thing we understand. So it'd be just like, I would assume... did you get a lot of nature as a kid or no?"", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Uh, no.', 'KATY: Yeah.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0I grew up in the suburbs with my nose in a book.', 'KATY: \xa0Like me. Very similar to me. So maybe me, I had to write my process, ""oh that\'s what nature is"". You know because I just had a bunch of facts in my mind and no physical experience like moving my body on the thing. So I started with the feet. I started with the feet because of a biomechanical interest.', 'KATY: But over time it converted to ""oh I know nature with my feet now. We\'ve met. I\'ve responded. I\'m in a more successful relationship now."" Like I see thistle in the same way that I can view my husband. It\'s something that has to be negotiated. I don\'t always have the skills. But in digging in sometimes I\'m able to learn something that makes that next interaction better. So that\'s all I\'m saying with ', "" is, your physical body has the capacity to improve in some way its relationship with the body and all of the other things that live around you that are alive and living and their life depends on your skills and your skills depend on their lives. You are in a relationship. \xa0But you might not have noticed because someone else is digging through nature on your behalf. Someone else's relationship, someone else has been communicating with the earth for you so that you can continue to sit in and not engage. That's a very long answer to your question but I think you would find that while honoring your city girl and loving her and visiting her most of the time that you would probably would fall in love with your nature girl."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Mmm.', 'KATY: And you would find that your nature girl was getting more done on the list of the things that city girl was trying to do.', ""STEPHANIE: \xa0Woah.

You need help? \xa0Here you go. Like it was just kind of a way of saying in it\'s natural... in its natural state, like that\'s what permaculture is. Permaculture is going ""hey, we broke this all down because we didn\'t really know what was happening yet but through exposed periods of time to this way we found that actually putting back some of the natural systems was more efficient and gave us more diversity in the things that we wanted."" So this is like the movement permaculture movement.', 'STEPHANIE: ', 'KATY: Oh. \xa0Go sit outside. No towel. No nothing on the ground. On something that you think is dirty. You can not do gooey. If you don\'t feel gooey, you don\'t have to do gooey. And if really truly the aversion is the dirt, then maybe put a towel down. Like this is how you scale the exercise. You scale the exercise by saying, ""I just can\'t do the gooey. But I\'ll put a blanket down."" \xa0And then you make it thinner so that the sticks and the things poke through you. And then you just look at it. Right? And then maybe you just peel back the blanket towards you so just your arm is on there. And then you kind of lean to the right or to the left. So now you\'re basically doing what you did with yoga tune up balls or fascia release or rubbing texture in but you\'re just letting the ... the balls are just the tiny acorns that are underneath your tree. And you\'re going ""this is a relationship. And I can\'t tolerate it right now. I don\'t feel that I can yield into this information. I\'m afraid of this information."" You just watch all that comes up. Let it go. And then you just do it again. \xa0And then maybe you let your foot go out. The soles of our feet seem safer because they\'re far away and that skin is obviously stronger. So someday we can do the foot callus show is really the butt callus show is really the knee callus show which is really that all of your skin could be stimulated to develop just a little bit more.

But it became a love and so I came to your work because, it was just one of those social media connections where so much of what I was doing was talking about, ""Hey you can be doing some things with your body before pregnancy, maybe even during pregnancy, maybe even during labor, that\'s going to affect the mobility and the strength that you have going on."" \xa0And someone was like, ""Check out ', '."" \xa0I fell in love with your work. I want to talk about your work today in the context - well you can talk about it however you want - the context that I want to talk about is things are more movable and malleable than we\'re constantly told and we make so many decisions based on sedentary models, right?', 'GAIL: Oooh - this is a good topic!', 'GAIL: \xa0To be given a great cosmic mission as a very humble person that was unschooled in the immensity of this work. I am the opposite of you, Katy, in that you are a well-educated scientist and I am someone who walked into this from the grassroots, observed without training and learned from the mother and baby what they were doing. And then listened to people talking about it whether that was the midwife, the nurse, or the doctor. But really the mothers themselves. \xa0Then went to the literature and the research. Then went to other professionals. \xa0And in that way, I was able to see birth with a different lens. I didn\'t have any categories put into my head on how to think about it or what was dangerous, what was safe. You know I learned from homebirth midwives that were really spontaneously emerging from a need that society had during the 70s and 80s, so I learned really from observation. I was a very Montessorian type of thing. When Maria Montessori wanted to have an assistant, she went through even Piaget and even all these highly educated people but she picked the janitor\'s daughter because the janitor\'s daughter didn\'t already have sort of neuro ruts in her head on how to think and what to assume. And that\'s how I learned about birth. And I had a question in my mind on, from being with women who wanted to have a natural birth, who were motivated and had great energy and great hope. And yet some of these women, not of the majority but some, had difficult births and felt like, ""What did I do wrong?"" \xa0And I thought, wow, they\'ve got a great attitude. They\'ve done the same thing that the other women did for all practical purposes. Why would birth be much the same for them? So, \xa0I asked the question, ""How can we help birth be easier when someone\'s got the intentions for natural birth?"" \xa0Then that led from one discovery to the next and really crossing outside of the birth field into other professions that were body related helped me connect some dots.', 'KATY: So I was reading your bio and ', ', kind of like the goal of it is to present this new birth paradigm. But how do you explain or describe that paradigm - this new paradigm?', ""GAIL: Three easy words have come to me in the last year, Katy. Physiology before birth. \xa0If we turn to physiology, we are awakening the innate ability of the body. We have in our human perspective a very mechanical view. \xa0And in the childbirth education, even in the obstetrical book, even in the delivery, there is a bit of an idea, if people think about it, of course they can't really believe that, but really but how it's presented it's like getting a basketball through a basketball hoop..."", 'KATY: Mm-hmm.', ""GAIL: \xa0And if the ball is a little bit big, well let's give it a little more push. And if we can't get the ball through the basketball hoop let's bypass it and maybe we'll just cut open the hoop. And it's like we're adding force. There's something called the three Ps. The passenger, that's the baby, the passage, that's the pelvis, and the pressures, that's the uterine contractions. And the idea is make as much pressure as is safe, right up to the edge of safety, to try to force the baby or the passenger through the pelvis. \xa0And I'm like, wait a minute. That's not really how the body works. The body has got the ability to respond but our sedentary lifestyle has reduced that mobility within the tissue and within the joints and we can bring it back... You know, it's a spectrum. It's not an either or. We can help someone move from a stiffer less mobile, less ideal birth situation across a spectrum towards an easier side. For some people, that's as simple as a single technique. And for other people, they have to work at it every day, day after day to overcome some event. \xa0So what are they trying to overcome? We live in gravity and we have sudden stops or sometimes a twist during a sudden stop. So think about someone's moving along, they bumped into the edge of something, the inside of their body continues to go. Like if you were in a little car accident. You drive along and you hit the curb. The seatbelt holds your shoulder back but your uterus continues (if you have a \xa0uterus) continues to go in that trajectory. And that can pull on the ligaments and the support tissues that supports around the uterus. In that way, and then the jolt of it can sometimes then leave the uterus in that twist so it's like taking a water balloon and twisting it a little bit in the middle. It makes a little neck shape and the fascia, the connective tissue, can sort of thicken or freeze - not freeze like exactly, like thicken to hold that shocked space. \xa0"", 'KATY: Stiffen maybe?', 'GAIL: Yeah, stiffen. The fibers thicken up. And now the baby says, ""Wow, there\'s a speed bump. I was gonna put the back of my head down by the cervix but you know there\'s this ligament that\'s twisted over there or..."" It\'s really interesting too, because as I came up with this idea of I think there\'s something in there that\'s twisted, then I learned from the body workers that yes indeed, the uterus is like a big air balloon with ropes in it. As Carol Phillips describes in her work...', 'GAIL: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: Or a lack of movement. And so we're kind of going, well this birth is, you know, birth can be this natural biological thing. But also is an abundant amount of movement or a way that you're using your body. And then to go back to what you were saying, this idea about, I've never heard the basketball through a hoop. I've heard a couch going through an upstairs apartment doorway at the same time. Where you're like bending and rotating and..."", ""GAIL: You know that brings in, that image of trying to get a couch through a rounded door frame is about flexion or extension of the head. The head isn't round, it's a little bit longer so that's a good picture."", ""KATY: It makes it a little bit more complex. If you're just gonna shove a basketball, I just know that I push down, you know, hard hard push down."", 'GAIL: \xa0Yeah. Right?', 'GAIL: Mm.', 'KATY: When the hoop is made up of parts with joints, that the hoop can actually change its shape...', 'GAIL: Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: then we go one other step to what you're talking about which I believe is saying that your uterus either beforehand or during, when it becomes an environment for something else ... all that that body, your body, and thus your uterus and all of the other parts have been through, that kind of sets the shape to that environment. That hoop which is also no as permanently fixed as we said it to be in the simple model of birth. Right? \xa0Like I think it comes down to there's just a very simple model where whether the mother is receiving it or people that work in birth get this very static model. Three pieces all of them fixed and then the only thing that a mother can control then, so to speak, is how hard that she can bear down. Is that what you mean by force."", 'GAIL: Yeah. How hard she can bear down or someone pushes on her uterus or somebody gives her a drug to make the uterus work harder.', 'KATY: So that becomes the only thing that she has agency over.', 'GAIL: Yeah.', 'KATY: Essentially in that model. We\'re trying to increase agency and say, ""You actually, you facilitate many more movements before and during labor."" \xa0And that\'s what your work is, right?', ""GAIL: Yes, everything from the birth positions that match the angle of baby's head to where the baby is waiting in the pelvis. For some babies, they're still high when pushes begin. For some, the babies are well low in the pelvis already."", 'KATY: Is that birthing position of the baby or the mother in that case?', ""GAIL: Of the mother - the birth giver's position and then so we're looking at the baby's position in pregnancy as a mirror of the space available in the uterus ..."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""GAIL: \xa0So I used to talk about... oh my goodness let's back it up. So we used to think in the 90s, way back in the 90s, with the wonderful work of optimal fetal positioning by Gene Sutton, that the pregnant person's posture could influence the baby's position. And I believe at that time it was true. And it is somewhat true to this day. And then - and I'll tell you why I think it's changed. \xa0So that sitting up and letting the abdomen be a hammock for the baby and let the uterus come forward would let the baby's back swing forward because the back is heavier. Ok, that's posture. You taught us alignment is more than posture. So that was intriguing because now we get in the function of the body. And what I found in around 2005, is maternal positioning or the positioning of the pregnant person during pregnancy wasn't really enough. And maybe this was from low thyroid epidemic. Something metabolic. Something shifting. We have a more sedentary lifestyle. We have more time in the car. More time on couches than ever before. Quite a bit more than the 70s. That's for sure. "", 'KATY: For sure, yeah.', ""GAIL: So we're seeing the changes. So what I brought in was let's continue with good posture and I'd like to learn more about your alignment and then let's add some activities. And there are two categories of activities that parents can do themselves. One is increase the range of motion of the joints. And we do that with daily activities. Walking. Stretching. Maybe a gentle yoga sequence. \xa0Or a nice stretching thing like hands and knees and undulating the spine. Breathing deeply. Those are all very important. Surprisingly I'd like to bring back the importance of deep breathing to pregnancy preparation because it connects the mind and body together through the basel nerves. \xa0And so we have increasing those joints around, not just in the pelvis, but all over in the shoulders and the neck - getting our body functional. \xa0But because we live in gravity and we have sudden stops. Because we've been sedentary, or worn high heels, or sat in cars or whatever we ... we naturally do - not naturally to the species but naturally to our civilization..."", 'KATY: Yeah - culturally do.', ""GAIL: What we culturally do. It's nobody's fault. But combine that with gravity and some of us end up in situations where it's hard to give birth. And you know other things with dietary and which providers we pick and on and on... But there's more than three variables."", 'KATY: Right.', 'GAIL: What we can add is a static stretch or passive stretch activity and that\'s where we get into techniques on the spinning babies website. I call them myofascial releases, but they\'re little a bit unique to dynamic body balancing and some of the more gentle versions of static stretch where a person lays very specifically on the edge of her bed, held by a helper that keeps them safe from falling. And their shoulders and hips are stacked. You can see this in sideline lays. The leg - their top leg as they\'re laying on their side, their top leg comes up and over and gently hangs off the edge of the bed while their helper holds that hip back. The hips are stacked. And the weight of the leg puts a passive stretch into the muscles for half of the pelvis. Now that stretch for about 2 minutes or longer tells the brain ""make these muscles longer."" And the leg it seems like it melts. It just relaxes. It hangs a little lower and you\'re done. And then you switch to the other side and do both legs. \xa0So that there\'s more symmetry. Now for a short period of time, you\'ve made more room in the pelvis. People are more comfortable in pregnancy or in birth, the baby doesn\'t have to push back his muscles. Suddenly the muscles soften and they\'re supple. And the baby can rotate as it rotates, like a key unlocking a door, through the pelvis to come out of the bottom of the pelvis. The muscles, the pelvic floor muscles, and all around supporting the baby are all lengthened and softened and open easier.', 'KATY: Sideline release is my favorite of all your moves. And when I saw it, I was like, ""Oh, that is our strap stretch, but done in a completely passive, more gravity assisted way."" It\'s when - we would do it - if anyone\'s taken yoga... imagine putting a strap around your leg, lifting it up towards the ceiling. Better yet than imagining, just go do it now listeners! \xa0Just grab...', ""GAIL: Is this the one where you're laying on the mat and you put the strap over your foot?"", 'KATY: Yes, put the strap over your foot and then you bring it across the midline of the body. \xa0And ...', ""GAIL: It's like that on even more so. "", 'KATY: On your side.', ""GAIL: And even more so. And if you had to do self-care and didn't have a helper you could do the strap stretch in three locations and then do it standing. And then get to tree pose. Right? That's all on that spectrum. But for sideline release it really, Katy, gets deeper into the pelvic floor and everything. "", ""KATY: It is deeper because now the leg, instead of being straight up and down where you can't feel the leg, when you stack it on your side as you do, now the weight of the leg is more. The torque that's created by the weight of the leg is greater. \xa0So the pull, that leg, is pulling on the hips and the fascia that ends up connecting to the sacrum."", 'GAIL: Yeah.', 'KATY: So you\'re not only stretching the leg you\'re actually pulling the sacrum backwards away from the front of the pelvis so you have more birthing space. You know what I mean. You\'re actually creating a tension that ends up -- the back of the pelvis, the size of it, if you imagine a bowl, is dictated by where the sacrum is. So as the sacrum is pulled posteriorly, the size of your basketball changes a little bit. So it\'s a beautiful exercise. \xa0But also something else you said. \xa0Again we go back to this sedentary simple model. We think that we\'re only... all the cliches like, ""put a watermelon in your nose"" you know what I mean? It\'s all this giant thing - small space. \xa0That\'s what we keep focusing on. And less so is that the baby and the mother, the birther, you\'re not only dealing with an object space issue. You\'re dealing with a tension issue. There\'s some things you can do about space, but they have, I mean there\'s a fixed limited to the amount of space. You\'re not gonna go from putting a watermelon in your nose versus putting a watermelon through a basketball hoop. \xa0The amount of space that you have to play with is pretty small. The amount of tension you have to play with is much much greater. Meaning, you have a lot more agency over releasing those tensions... the capacity for tension reduction is much greater than your capacity to wildly increase your space.', ""GAIL: Mm! \xa0That's beautiful."", 'GAIL: Ok! \xa0So now the answer to that question is always now. ', 'KATY: Right.', ""GAIL: And the range is that some people don't need to spin their baby. But everybody can have increased comfort, suppleness, and body function. I don't think I've met too many people that don't benefit from those things."", 'KATY: Right. Right.', ""GAIL: So before pregnancy, if we're functioning better we're gonna have an easier first trimester. We're gonna have easier digestion and elimination, right? So then it's the second trimester that physically determines the baby's position. The baby may not be head down yet, but it is the pregnant person's positions and behaviors and gravity during the second trimester that is found to have more results of how the baby is lined up in the third trimester. Which is when, finally, at the end of the third trimester is when the doctors and midwives are noticing baby's position and wondering if it's going to affect birth. And they give the advice of well, babies can turn at any time. Whoops. Some babies can turn at any time. So how do we know who needs help? \xa0And we have invitations to act, invitations to add more, what I call, well not just me but body balancing. So the sideline, I did want to mention that the sideline release comes from the work of Dr. Carol Phillips the chiropractor who was told about it through an obstetrician who had observed it by chance - saw a posterior baby rotate. The baby was facing forward and not coming out. And the mother rolled over and her leg went over the edge of the bed and the baby rotated and came out right away... And fortunately, the doctor was standing right there. It doesn't always work that fast but it certainly can and that's why spinning babies is getting so popular with the nurses and the midwives around the world."", ""KATY: So, spinning babies exercises, they're something that really ... they're just using your body differently - relaxing your body. So that can be done - I could be spinning my babies before I even intend to have one."", ""GAIL: Yeah. Right. You're making a functioning balanced body."", 'KATY: Right. And unwinding maybe some of those quirks within my uterus that you were talking about ahead of time, so', 'GAIL: Yes.', 'KATY: like I always say, ad nauseam, that movement is facilitating so many of your biological functions that it might behoove many out there to pay attention to some of those kinks before they want to call on them. You know what I mean?', ""GAIL: It gives you more options. It's like, yes it's true. You could wait and see. And maybe the baby will be head down and maybe the baby will be anterior and curled up in the smallest diameter to fit. And if not, maybe one or two techniques will fix it. You know. So to speak. But if not, wouldn't it be nice to have started earlier so you have more options. People have different opinions."", 'KATY: That\'s true. That\'s true of everything through. \xa0I\'ll teach someone who is 60 and it\'s like, ""I wish I knew this when I was 20."" \xa0I feel like movement is a hard thing to change because we just are so, our tendencies to sedentarism run strong and certainly in the moment we\'re always like, ""I wish I had done this earlier."" \xa0So maybe go check out Spinning Babies. Where can people go find more - see some of your moves? What\'s the best way? \xa0Movement is so video dependent. Do you have videos that people can go check out?', ""GAIL: \xa0So much yes. Well, we do have the spinning babies parent class video. It's a download from "", ' but you can also find it on the ', "" website. And that one shows how to do sideline release with your partner or helper. It shows forward-leaning inversion which helps some of the cervical ligaments so that there's lots of room for the baby's head and also makes dilation easier. \xa0And a gentle shifting of the uterus, the mateado of the tradition, the Mexican tradition with the rebozo, and the standing sacral release which helps release the sacrum so it can back out of the way of the baby. And all of these things can be started, you know, I would say, when you do daily exercises and do some of these techniques from 30 weeks on, people are having dramatically noticeable easier births in higher numbers. Not everybody will but I'm pretty happy if 80% of people can address 80% of their situations to have an easier more comfortable birth and we do hear dramatic results. And some people will only hear about this in labor or only a few days before labor. \xa0And many of them are having improvements too. \xa0Maybe 80% - that's a pretty ... I'm pretty confident to say 80%. It might be 90% if you start early. Might be higher. I don't know. We do have people who are interested in research so we'll have to do this again in a couple more years and have the results."", 'GAIL: Ok, so there\'s two kinds of manual rotations. And typically when the baby is breech, head up, and sometimes sideways they\'ll do it too. \xa0Now sideways I have a technique that works 19 out of 20 times in 24 hours. Parents can do it themselves. Go to Spinning Babies. Look up baby positions, sideways, transverse lie. If your baby is sideways after 30 weeks. If your baby is sideways at 24 weeks, just do the balancing. That\'s pretty normal. But after 37-40 weeks, people are doing the forward-leaning inversion 7-14 times a day and the next day or 36 hours later or the next time they go to the doctor, their baby is head down. And the doctor is like, ""Wow. Don\'t even tell me how this happened."" \xa0That\'s the usual response. The doctor says, ""Don\'t even tell me how this happened."" \xa0', 'KATY: I was doing aerial silks. Aerial silk inversion.', ""GAIL: But breech is not... you can do the same thing for breech baby. Which is babies hips are lower than the head. The baby's hips are gonna come out before the baby's head comes out. And that can be a safe birth but it can also be a complicated birth so that doctors and midwives in America today are trying to avoid vaginal, breech, births, which is sad. \xa0Because you know one or two in a hundred are very complicated and they'd rather do cesareans for all of them. You know, you could get 10% breech births, needing somebody extremely skilled to help, and of those extremely skilled people, you can still run into one in a hundred that's pretty sketchy. But most of those babies, you can't tell the difference between them at 2 years old. A researcher who is observing the child development would have no idea that that child had a difficult birth. So they'll all recover - for most of them. So then the doctor turns that baby, some midwives do it too, at say 36 weeks to make that baby be head down. \xa0Now that's called an External Cephalic Version. And we have a doctor/midwife team down in Rio de Janeiro Brazil who are telling people with breech babies at that time in their pregnancy - the last month - to do the spinning babies activities. \xa0I call the three sisters of balance. The rebozo sifting manteado, the forward-leaning inversion, and the sideline release - to do them every day for that week. And then come back and if the baby is still breech they'll turn the baby manually through the abdomen with their hand. And they're finding that there's many more babies that are head down. Or if the baby isn't head down that turning the baby manually is much easier than if they didn't do those techniques. Because they're taking, as you say, they're taking those roadblocks, those speed bumps, out of the path of the baby..."", 'KATY: Do you know Dr. Eden Fromberg?', 'GAIL: Yes.', ""KATY: She's an OB/GYN. And she was telling me in some instances where she was doing manual rotations that, you know, with her, anatomy and also just that hands-on ability of assessing, she said she was almost always working around a very tense psoas major. \xa0Right? Which is going to significantly just reduce the pliabilities of the case that the baby is in, which is the uterus. And so just by freeing up some tension and creating more mobility in them, you create more space for the baby, then, to move. "", 'GAIL: Yes.', ""KATY: You really are the environment. Don't forget the tensions. Don't forget the tensions that you bring to the table."", ""GAIL: \xa0Yeah. Making space is what it's all about. Because it's not about a baby with a personality problem. Why won't this baby turn?"", 'KATY: Stubborn. Stubborn kids.', ""GAIL: There's another way of talking about manual rotation. Is that the baby is facing forward and you're late into the birth and the cervix is dilating and the head is just not fitting through the bottom of the pelvis. And there's an expert named Katherine Oz. Her last name is Oz, isn't that great?"", ""KATY: Mm-hmm. She's a wizard."", ""GAIL: And she teaches about reaching in and turning the baby's head. Like you're rotating the head with your fingertips. And it's done very late in labor when the cervix is pretty much open and she, the great researcher that she is on this topic, is saying she does spinning babies techniques that she learned from the website before - she has the mother do that before she is willing to turn the baby's head because it's so much easier if you've made that space first. And she teaches other doctors to do this technique. She didn't come up with the technique. It's been around. But she's teaching the value of it to reduce cesarean. But now what we're doing is we're just crossing the borders between bodywork and birth. Between midwifery and obstetricians. And that's one of the gifts of spinning babies. Is that we're getting everybody together on behalf of parents and babies to make this becoming human easier."", 'KATY: Well, movement is multi-disciplinarian. You know what I mean?', 'GAIL: Mm. \xa0Mm-hmm.', 'KATY: At the end of the day we are in such a sedentary culture that, again, those signs of movement malnutrition... the fact that movement is the big piece. I think that so many disciplines can embrace that to go, ""Ok. I can consider movement being an issue."" \xa0And just once again, if I were to make a t-shirt for this episode for everyone listening, this idea that less tension equals more space. ', 'GAIL: Mm.', ""KATY: So I think that we're used to thinking of a space as the side of the room. But imagine your room had pliable walls and when I pushed on it, I got more space. That's what the body is. It is not a rigid body."", 'GAIL: Yes.', ""KATY: Make more space. The greater your capacity is to deform when forces are applied to you. Like that's what we're doing."", ""GAIL: And we can prove that as any parent who has had more than one child vaginally. \xa0The first baby has got this molded head. And the second baby comes out with basically either very little molding, you know, compared to their first sibling. Because the pelvis is more mobile. \xa0Now we have seen large babies heads come out without molding - it's the third or fourth baby. \xa0Why? Because the pelvic outlet is supposed to be like 13 centimeters across and you can have a baby whose head is like 14 inches around come out of the pelvis - the first one's molded a little bit. The second one a little bit less. Then you see babies with large heads coming out with no molding. What's going on? That sacrum is moving. It's what you did your first paper on, Katy. That sacrum is just moving out of the way in a reflective, response that can be felt by anybody who is standing and supporting a birthing person can put their hand in the back of the sacrum and feel the big bulge of the sacrum. And the doula and the midwives even think that's the baby's head pushing the bones out. \xa0No, that's the sacrum doing its reflective action to back up. And so we are moving. We're mobile. Breath is the first, you know, the first mobilization of the body. And our daily movement is, takes that further. Throughout the whole body."", ""KATY: \xa0What's your most important takeaway?"", ""KATY: I guess, you know, if I were holding up a couch to the doorway of my upstairs apartment at the end of a stairwell, it looks like it just won't fit through."", 'GAIL: Yeah.', 'KATY: If my understanding is that I\'m just going to push it through it\'s not gonna fit. But if I can see it from another perspective which is; no, the couch is going to be rotating and there\'s two other people here lifting and moving things around, then I can see the possibilities. So I feel like what spinning babies is really doing is saying, ""the model of movement during birth is not nuanced enough and we\'re making decisions based on an oversimplified model."" ', ""GAIL: Hallelujah. We're making it a mechanical event of adding pressure when the physiology is waiting for us to notice that the size of the doorframe can expand."", ""KATY: Right. \xa0And also that it's not a couch. It's a couch that's got bendy parts and muscles. \xa0And so I think that also, my simplified model right now is, there's nothing really that's saying what the baby is doing. It's all uterus just pushing it out. Right? Where I've got video of my kid moving to start coming out. You know what I mean? \xa0Like that when everything else was still, you could see the squirming action."", 'GAIL: Yeah!', ""KATY: We don't even have models to say that "", ""GAIL: \xa0The baby's an active partner."", ""KATY: Right right. We're saying the head is flexing and nodding like it's being pushed and that is to a certain point. But there is no perspective to say is there anything that we're doing that's influencing what the baby is doing to get itself through. Even more agency than we are really even working with yet. A whole other show. We'll talk about this probably in sixty years from now when it's more evident. But until then, we will age dynamically and move and do what we can with making the models more complex but making the perspective larger. \xa0Open your mind, open your pelvis! \xa0That's the takeaway."", ""GAIL: I'm waiting for your book: Dynamic Pregnancy."", 'KATY: I know. \xa0Gail! \xa0I just said I wanted to move more. Not sit down and write another book!', 'GAIL: Hey I hear ya!', 'KATY: Well, I write books and do videos but at the end of the day people love working with live teachers which is why we have live teachers out there. You have live teachers as well. Is that correct? \xa0Like can I go to someone to get help with the exercises?', ""GAIL: Oh thank you. We are expanding that. We have six beautiful trainers right now and we need more than six. So we have this progressive and various different ways of expanding that's going on right now. Last year we started the spinning babies aware practitioner. So the massage therapist, chiropractor, bodyworker who does hands-on care for pregnancy who is looking for a physiology before force approach. No force. They're ethically deciding unless they're specifically trained for it they're not trying to rotate the baby or manipulate the baby but rather help parents create space. That's the spinning babies aware practitioner. We have a listing on our website that's just getting started. We have another workshop in May in St. Paul and in May in San Diego. Both in May for spinning babies aware practitioners. And midwives and doulas are taking that also so they have better hands-on care. They have to have taken a spinning babies workshop to get on the listing - twice so they're integrating the paradigm. So then the childbirth educators want to do that too for one to one parent education or small group parent education. So this April we have the Spinning Babies Certified Parent Educator program beginning in St. Paul. We have it again in St. Paul in July. In Brazil, in Sao Paulo Brazil. And Boston Massachusetts in October. And in Europe - we're still looking for the venue in Europe - for November. So the parent educators will learn how to do a 3-hour preparation for parents in these techniques that we talked about today. And it will be a supplement to a longer childbirth education program that - so any childbirth educator of any method can use the spinning babies as a supplement. And we'll give them the license to teach it in our way use the name in their promotion. Then in a couple of years, I'll expand for providers to be spinning babies trainers again. But I have some homework to do before I open it up."", ""KATY: Little bit at a time. We'll put links to everything, your website, your Vimeo, these events, in our show notes. And Gail, I just wanted to say thank you for coming on. I really appreciate your perspective."", ""GAIL: Katy, thank you for all that you've done. You've expanded me so much. You've taught me so much. And in fact, your recent, but both of your recent books about getting older and moving is just so exciting. I love it. BEcause now I'm in your audience there."", ""KATY: Well you're dynamic! \xa0Like, we're all - you're definitely on the move. So keep it going."", ""GAIL: Thank you, Katy. And you know, continue your work. It's so important. It's so great. And it's so supportive. Thank you for being this bridge."", ""Here's her question. "", "" Ok, I like this question. So first of all, the bit I think that you're remembering is from an "", 'episode where it was recorded from a live event where my co-authors of ', ' were speaking at a live event. And one of them was recalling this time when she was doing the pelvic list exercise -she was not someone who used a cane - she was doing a pelvic list exercise and was struggling to do it and had asked if she could hold onto the wall to do it. Or she said I\'m gonna go hold on to the wall. And I had pointed out that there was another way of breaking it down so that she wasn\'t training to now use her arms with her leg. Because I knew it was her intention to not go towards a cane. So that is a separate phenomenon. What you do in an exercise class in a very controlled environment to what might be necessary for negotiating I\'ll say vigorous terrain meaning lots of texture but also lots of weight. I assume you\'ll be carrying a pack and also over a long period of time. So, you\'re used to the terrain now, which is fantastic. But one of the things I like to point out, as you go longer and longer distances, it\'s not really a repetition or more repetitions of you using the same parts. As you fatigue your body, as you go longer, you begin to recruit new body parts that only are called upon when you actually move, you know, all day long. Which is a phenomenon that most have not experienced and why you will see me teaching many more, you know, 20 mile walks, 16 mile hikes, in our retreats. Because I can talk about it and talk about it but it\'s all very theoretical until you yourself push yourself to do something like all day movement like you\'re about to do. So, that being said, let me answer some of your questions. What is the purpose of the poles? The poles are there - so if you look down at your feet, if everyone can, if you drew a circle that kind of traced the outside of your feet but also connected them. So kind of a rectangle/oval shape. That\'s your base of support. If you put one hand in a cane or a walking stick, then you would trace the circle that picked up the tip of the cane as well as both of your feet. \xa0You see how now you have a larger base of support. \xa0When you put two poles down, then your base of support is the size of the circle that goes around and picks up your feet and the tips of both poles. So it does increase your base of support. And also, you know, we talked earlier in that first question about falling. When you go onto one leg, the tendency to fall is also to the right and to the left due to weakness. Kind of falling out. If everyone tried to step on one foot and hold it there for a long time. You\'re not going to see your ankle wobble front to back. You\'re gonna see it wobble right to left. So you have kind of a lot of instability to the right and to the left. And when you load that with a heavy backpack, now the weight of the unstable thing is more. \xa0You\'re weight\'s higher, closer to your head. Because our backpacks aren\'t down by our legs. \xa0So that little wobble to the right loaded with 20 or 30 pounds can now go faster and farther. So having a pole on that side is what helps center your backpack. \xa0Now that being said, can you train your body to do that? \xa0Absolutely. And so I would recommend for everyone out there, if you want a training tip. Put on your backpack, your hiking backpack, and do your pelvic list exercises there. Because then that slight wobble to the right or to the left, you\'ll now feel the magnitude of what it will be when you are fully loaded. That\'s my little training tip from me to you. So try that so you are actually doing your pelvic list to the weight that you\'ll need to carry and it\'s still in a nice controlled environment. You\'re unshod. You\'re on a block or a stack of books and you\'re home so you don\'t have to worry about falling off a log or in a river or anything like that. Then the next piece though becomes you are moving all day long. So another thing that poles do is they allow some of that push off as you\'re moving forward, right? You\'re climbing up. Which means you\'re pushing down with your legs when you\'re going up. You\'re going forward which means you\'re pushing back with your legs as you go forward. So your legs are solely responsible for that. You\'re going to be adding a lot more miles, a lot more days, than you\'ve ever done before which is what makes a through hike such a challenge. The capacity of movement that we\'ve never ever experienced. And so it allows you to share some of that work with your arms. And so, in the end, poles could absolutely create a more positive experience as well as make finishing more feasible. Now that all being said, I don\'t think that you need to take out the poles and do everything with the poles. \xa0The poles could be - that you pull them out maybe randomly so maybe start training a little bit with your poles. \xa0You can, when you\'re fatigued, you can be, ""This is when I\'m gonna pull out my poles and really watch my form."" And then add this pole as kind of like a pseudo leg. Right? It\'s starting to operate kind of like a leg. And as well as gets that little bit of extra balance. So maybe if your balancing muscles are like, ""We\'re done."" \xa0It\'s like, great, I\'ve got these poles so we can go on. So yes, I think that they\'re an absolutely wonderful tool when you are doing something so outside of the box. And even if you don\'t use them, that\'s fine. But you have them. And if you trained a little bit with them you now are more likely to finish this amazing event. So that would be my feedback. Thank you for asking that question. I hope many people go ""Oh, I see. I can see a little clarity."" And maybe figure out the rest of any separate questions for themselves.

Not in its entirety - I am not making an audiobook, sorry. But over the next few episodes of Move Your DNA, from now until the end of August (this is 2018, in case you're listening to it later), I’ll read you some of my favorite essays from "", ', talk about some of the connections between them, and chime in on my own writings to say things differently or offer some behind the scenes info if I feel like it.

Are you ready to get moving?', 'MUSIC', 'KATY: Hello friends, and welcome to Things That Swing: that is me reading aloud three essays on, wait for it, boobs, testicles, and arms. I wrote the content of ', ""so long ago. This is 2018. A lot of this was written in 2008, 2009, so we're talking almost a decade. And I wasn’t very practiced of a writer. And as many of you know I write how I speak. And before having much of an internet life: that is, you know, people reading what you said all over and not necessarily having all the context for it and commenting on it and commenting on you, I didn’t select my words as consciously as I do these days. And so I cringe - I really do cringe. It's hard to read sometimes - \xa0when I pick up my older writings. But then again, I'm also cringing when I consider myself at 12 and at 19 and at 27 years of age. So we are all learning to pay more attention to our thoughts, our behaviors so I’ve decided that I’m going to love myself, and my writing at all ages because I’ve learned so much from being myself and making choices. PS I have a silly sense of humor and the content of "", "" is very silly. Still, so many of you have written to me or told me in person that this is your favorite book, or this is the book where you're perception of movement and that movement was something that you had control over - that changed. And so I still want to honor this book. Even though it makes me cringe, it doesn't make all of you cringe and so I'm going to, instead of wishing it would go away, I'm picking the essays that crack me up the most because, let’s face it, laughter is the best psoas release of all time. You’re welcome. Without further ado, allow me to read to you three of my favorite essays."", ""I had no idea how amazing boobs were. I was aware of their magical power of course, but it took calming another ranting, inconsolable human being with them for me to truly understand. And then I had a kid. October is not only National Walking Month, but also National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which I petition to rename National Breast Health Month, because breasts do not need more cancer awareness, but they need more health. I am also glad that National Breast Month is not National Running Month because that would be uncomfortable. How uncomfortable? One biomechanics researcher took a look: The study: Breast displacement in three dimensions during the walking and running gait cycles. Methods: Fifteen D-cup runners, reflectors attached to their nipples - doesn’t it pull the hair out when you take them off? What? Doesn’t it? - watch them walk and run on a treadmill while their breasts are filmed. (It’s for science, people, for SCIENCE!) Findings: During walking, breasts move evenly in all directions. This is just one of the reasons I love walking. During running, however, “More than 50 percent of the total movement was in the up-down direction, 22 percent side-to-side and 20 percent in-and-out.”4 Wait. What’s “in-and-out?” You mean like a punching balloon? Yes, exactly. Why the difference in walking vs. running? Because walking is entirely different from running. Your body travels much more up and down, even if that up and down movement comes from your knees bending to absorb the shock and not your feet leaving the ground much. Boobs. Your new gait-training tool. Your boobs are essentially a biofeedback device, visually demonstrating the inefficient moves of your whole body. (And just a note: I would probably edit that now to say, visually demonstrating any inefficient movements of your body, not implying that you have any per se.) Body swaying right and left? So will the girls. Breasts moving in and out? Your body is not flowing forward smoothly and has points of start-stop creating a stall in every step. Forget the hips. The boobs don’t lie. Here's another interesting tidbit: Researchers found that the poorer the breast support, the greater the effect on the whole-body kinetics of the runner. Using D-cuppers again (evidently, the more boob mass you have, the more it affects your whole-body performance), this study found an increase in medial loading of the pelvis and knees as a result of the breasts’ momentum. If you’re taking the ladies out for a run, invest in some nice support. Especially if you are a breastfeeding mom also working on getting your pelvis back together. That excessive medial loading is killer on the pubic symphysis. Even though I’m a walker, every girl needs to run across the street now and then. And this D+ cupper would die without Athleta (which is a company that makes bras) for bras and for everything else. Dear Athleta, I love you. You complete me. KB+ ATHLETA = 4EVER.5 \xa0"", ""I'll link to some of the research in the show notes on that."", 'Guess what? It’s time to talk testicles. You didn’t think I’d do it, but here I go. P.S. I\'ve decided against a video blog. If you’ve ever done the weight-machine circuit at the gym or followed the calisthenic stations at the park, chances are you may have noticed a lack of program development for the cremaster muscle. A gross oversight for sure, as this muscle is very important to the healthy function of the testicles. The word cremaster comes from the Greek verb meaning “I hang.” Clever. The cremaster is responsible for keeping the sperm-generating process underway by regulating temperature in ""le sac"" as well as keeping the boys protected in dangerous situations. Like tennis. Spermatogenesis is the process of generating mature sperm. This process happens inside the testicles and not only requires about sixty-four days, it also needs the perfect environment. Immature sperm cells don’t thrive in heat. Depending on outside temperature, body temperature, and the tightness of one’s pants, the cremaster is busy lifting or lowering the testicles to find an amount of heat that’s just right. The cremaster is like the Goldilocks of the scrotum. If you jump into a cold body of water, it’s the cremaster that yanks the boys towards the heat (your body) in order to protect the growing sperm. The cremaster works automatically (without you having to think about it), and in addition to temperature, this muscle also fires under stress. In the hunter-gathering days, (and here I\'d just like to pause and say there is still hunting-gathering today. I should probably have said, ""in hunter-gathering populations"") stressful situations usually meant (or mean) a threat to physical harm. The cremaster gets busy tucking the sensitive bits out of the way. The stress-cremaster response is very old in our DNA, so it hasn’t quite gotten the message that the stress you are feeling these days is more likely coming from driving in bad traffic or reading an email from the boss. You end up with testes close to the body more often than optimal, which can create over-heating of these precious tissues. The testicles can also be lifted into the body by using the pelvic floor’s muscles -pubococcygeal - or by sucking in your stomach. Sucking the belly in is really sucking the belly up. “Sucking it in” creates a vacuum that pulls the contents of your abdomen up into the dome of your diaphragm and raises the pelvic floor with it. The waistline flattens out, but now your testicles are perpetually heating up and your diaphragm isn’t free to move when you’re breathing. That\'s a hefty price for vanity. Scientists have been wondering for years why the left testicle hangs lower in most men (about seventy to eighty-five percent, depending on the source). Researchers have even created studies examining all ancient statues of nude men, cataloging the percentage of right vs. left. Now there’s a job. “Hey, get off my back, it’s for research, man!” I tend to think that right/left testicle altitude might have something to do with one psoas being tighter than the other, resulting from the use of a dominant leg. (And just as an aside: I have a lot of ideas. It doesn\'t mean that they\'re right. They\'re just an idea of mine.) Other fun testicle facts: The word “avocado” comes from the Aztec word, and I\'m going to spell it for you here friends, ahuacatl, meaning “testicle tree.” Avocado fruit hangs in pairs, with one slightly below the other. So, I wonder what the Aztec word for guacamole would be, then. For optimal sperm and organ (in this case, testicle) health, it is best to avoid interfering with the health-regulating processes your body uses on a regular basis. So, say Bon Voyage to your leather pants, unless it’s a very special occasion. Stress plays a factor in many diseases, and pelvic floor and testicular health are no different. To check and see if you have your testicles in a stress vice, stand up and see if you can relax the pelvic floor just a bit. Most of us, men and women, think that we have to not only shut off our urine, we have to super shut it off. It’s like we get points for really not wetting ourselves. Guess what, no prizes today. In fact, if you are going to get any prize - really healthy testes - \xa0use the minimal amount of force to keep your bladder closed, not the maximum. I wonder, if I made an infomercial for the Cre-Master, would it sell as well as the Thigh-Master?', 'KATY: \xa0Chapter one. Two miles: Nutritious Movement and Diseases of Captivity. We see in order to move. We move in order to see. A quote by William Gibson. \xa0Once when I was in college I went for an entire day without eating. I wasn\'t planning to fast but I had a 100-page paper due the following Monday and sat down to type the entire thing on a Friday. I worked straight through for 20 hours before I realized when I dropped exhausted into the bed the next day that I hadn\'t eaten a bite or had a sip to drink. My lack of eating that day wasn\'t a big deal but by the next morning, my body was sending me some serious ""you need to eat"" signals. \xa0I\'m sure most of you have had a similar experience of missing your regular scheduled food intake due to travel, work, kids, school, or something else that simply got in the way. Maybe you\'ve even chosen to fast for a period of time. Regardless of the reason, the physical signal following a period of food abstinence is usually hunger, which makes sense right? Eating is a physiological requirement. Food, specifically the nutrients found in food, is not optional. Nevertheless, eating optimally can be a challenge. Say, for example, that I described ""best, most nutritious diet in the world"" and dictate that it must include adequate calories (energy), an appropriate ratio of macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates), an appropriate quantity of micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, organic acids, trace minerals), and enough fiber. Furthermore, it must be fresh and free of harmful chemicals. Luckily, most of you reading this book aren\'t slowly starving or unable to purchase food so we can all move toward a healthy diet using this template for nutrition. Yes, our pocketbooks might be tight enough to prevent purchasing all optimal ingredients, but with a little prioritization we can usually figure out how to score the food we want by letting the stuff we don\'t need go. \xa0I\'ll bet that many of you reading this book have probably done quite a bit to educate yourself on a nutrition profile even more detailed than what I\'ve listed above. Take an appropriate ratio of fats, for example. What kind of fats are necessary? Saturated? Mono-unsaturated? Trans fats? What about Omega 3s? Why aren\'t Omega 3s on the list? I bet you understand that, when it comes to diet, details and context matter and that my template, while a good start, isn\'t very thorough. Take adequate calories for example. If you need to eat 2,500 calories a day for adequate energy, is 2,500 calories worth of Snickers bar an adequate diet?', 'VOICEOVER: \xa0And it’s not just Katy’s trademark humor, compassion, and straightforward approach to movement science you’ll get with each audiobook.

A perfect hour for an evening walk. And that’s what I thought as I went for my first weeknight walk in the sunlit evening. I walked instead of blogging. You can give me grief when you see me next, but I really don’t feel that badly, I'll have to admit. It’s hard to feel bad when walking gives me all those endorphins. You should try it. So, I’m out walking and noticing many new folks out along the beach path. Good for them! After witnessing this I decided on today’s topic. The arm-swinging thing. Take a closer look at the arm motion of your fellow walkers next time you have a chance. There are arms that don’t move at all, and arms that swing right to left instead of front to back. There can be one tight arm that moves less than the other, and my favorite, those working their arms \xa0more by holding weights. It’s an arm buffet, I tell you. Believe it or not, arm swing is an extremely important part of a natural gait pattern. And when digitally analyzing gait, you can tell a lot about shoulder and spine injuries-in-the-making just by watching what the arms are doing. Why do our arms swing when we walk? When you walk forward, it is supposed to be due to the fact that one leg pushes off behind you. Most people lift a leg out and fall forward, but that’s for a different blog. So now you have your right leg behind you, pushing back. That's a large quantity of mass - our legs make up quite a bit of our body weight - which can twist your pelvis around, creating torque on your spine. There needs to be something to balance out the twisting tendency walking creates on the spine. And the easiest thing to do is reach the arm back on the opposite side of the body, to help balance the twist. It’s called reciprocal arm swing. The opposite sides of the body reach back at the same time, an arm on one side and a leg on the other. The backward-reaching arm is not only great for reducing overuse (which I would probably say over-torque) of the spine, it is a nature-designed workout for the backs of the upper arm. Awesome! Lifting the arm up behind you keeps your tricep muscles toned and the armpit lymph free. (or at least moving lymph) If you thought three sets of twelve tricep exercises with a five-pound weight were effective, just wait until you use your arms correctly when walking. It tones those arms right up! When you are out walking, you are going to see another strange phenomenon. People are lifting their arms out in front of them because they think this means they are working harder and burning more calories. And maybe that's the case. But pumping your arms out in front creates extra tension in the front of the shoulders - muscles that are usually already super tight and fatigued from computering, driving, and sitting all day. The tighter the muscle, really, the fewer calories it burns. This forward motion tenses the trapezius and neck muscles too. And, if you aren’t swinging your arms behind you when you walk, there is nothing to help balance the torque created by the leg moving back, either. Nothing except the muscles in the lower back. Anyone out there have weak triceps (which is the back of the upper arm) and a tight lower back? Don’t make your low back muscles do the work for your arms. You’ll end up with shoulder issues and lumbar disk degeneration. Arms swing side to side? This is an indication that your chest and shoulders might have gotten so tight, the bones have rotated forward. Really pay close attention to keeping your arm swing in forward-pointing parallel lines to your body. One more thing. Bending the arms at the elbows to mimic speed walkers can reduce the energy you expend during a bout of walking. Race walkers are trying to minimize their energy expenditure so they can go very fast for a very long time. If you want to ramp up the kcals burned during your next walk - Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your arms. Here's the exercise: Stand and let your arms relax down by your sides. Lift one arm behind you, one at a time, to see how high you can get it (don’t twist the hips or shoulders. That’s cheating). Let the arm drop down and forward. It will swing out a little in front as you drop it, but don’t do any extra work to get it up higher. The work of your arms while walking should always be behind you. They relax when they come forward. Really working a fully extended arm while walking is going to change everything about your daily walk. You’ll get much more out of it, including increased metabolic and strength benefits. And P.S. You can’t swing both your arms if you are talking on your cell phone, now can you? Hands-free!"", ""1) Your body is made up of smaller bodies. So your boobs are the smaller bodies in this case. And the movement of one body creates movement of another body - which are your boobs - \xa0which can then start knocking you, your whole body, back around. Why is this important? Many do not recognize that the way they are moving matters. They only think THAT they’re moving matters. THAT you are moving matters, dear ones it's just, so does HOW."", '2) I said it in ', "" and I’m saying it again now. Yes, you move through an environment, but your environment is also moving you right back. I want healthy bits for all, and I think key to that is that you become aware of the ways you’re being moved or casted into position, even if these ways are subtle. So another point: we also call tiny limitations of movement subtle because we measure them in millimeters or degrees. So what does a few millimeters or a centimeter or two of movement matter? When instead the question is: what does twenty or thirty years of a few degrees of movement matter? There is an entirely different volume of movement to consider. And it's not being currently."", '3) Every part and every move plays a role in the total ecology of movement of your body. You don’t have to swing your arms around all of the time, but there is a reason they do this automatically. And to eliminate it can lead to any number of unintended consequences. And some consequences might not be easily measurable when you don’t think of movement, or the way you move, as playing a role in the rest of your body. The other takeaway: we need to move our arms more, and walking is an easy way to do it.', 'So thank you for looking beyond the poor writing, and grand statements, and debutante behavior.

Guess what? \xa0This is my one-hundredth episode of the Move Your DNA podcast. \xa0This is also the 8th episode in a shorter series I\'m doing on movement perspectives; \xa0Specifically, the various ways people think about and use movement. I am very excited about my guest on this episode and I hope you will be too but before I do what Hollywood calls the ""big reveal"", I\'ve got two fantastic questions to get to today. These are brought to you by our Dynamic Collective. \xa0This is a coop of sponsors: ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and ', "". \xa0All companies that support some lifestyle element of natural movement from minimal footwear - sandals, boots, running footwear - for all ages and all seasons, to minimal furniture that includes sitting cushions and balls that allows more of you to move while you're just sitting there. They sponsor this question and answer part of each episode of Move Your DNA and you can find more about them in our "", '. \xa0', 'So this is a fantastic question. I\'m going to try to parse it quickly. The first part of the question is, ""Do you have a high energy exercise prescription?"" I would say that, you could say yes or you could say no meaning that I think that we try to pursue the minutes at a certain intensity. That\'s exercise prescription from a fitness perspective. If you read the expanded version of ', "", there's a section in there on the Hadza about the minutes at high and medium levels of intensity compared to low levels of intensity. So if you want more information you can go look at that as well. I'm gonna speak to that a little bit right now. \xa0So, I think that the way that I would frame the need for high intensity has more to do with the need for the variation of heart and lung movement or shapes. So that's different than we're used to thinking about it because we're not used to thinking about all the different shapes that our thoracic cavity creates. So if you think about the thoracic cavity, it's got a diaphragm at the bottom. It's walls are the bony ribs but also the muscles in between each and then of course you've got the motion of the shoulder that it lifts up towards the ear. So you've got these three general ways that your thoracic cavity can shape shift. We call that breathing. But there's not one breath because every motion that you do, the relationship or the ecology between the movement that you're actually doing. \xa0Let's say that you're carrying something in one arm as you're sprinting and the intensity with which you're doing it - that would be the sprinting part - that would be a different thoracic cavity shape than if you were carrying something in your other arm or not carrying anything or having something on your back or pulling something. Because as you engage more parts of you, that is gonna all influence the shape your thoracic cavity has to be in in order to pull in that breath - in order to create the pressure change. So what we have been calling intensity you could also say it's a particular way that the heart is needing to move and it's a particular way that the thoracic cavity... and it's not really only the thoracic cavity. It's your abdominal cavity and your pelvic floor and your spine. The way all of that has to move with every single breath. \xa0So, in "", "" which is my earliest place that I've put text about heart rate - people are often, I would say, pursuing general fitness and the idea in exercise science is that the goal is to move towards the heart rate. So it doesn't really matter what the mode is or what the geometry is, you're moving towards something your watching on a heart rate monitor or something that you're measuring and are able to calculate the intensity. I am not after the intensity. I am after the various lung and heart movements because those create specific adaptations. And then of course there's a diversity in the piece in "", "" that I was talking about with the Hadza, they are, for a lot of that, medium and intensity work, it's things like carrying large volumes of water, carrying heavy objects, that the heart rate becomes elevated to the seventy-five percent and the eighty-five percent because of the loads that the body is under as opposed to just doing whatever it takes to get the heart to behave in that particular way. So I do think that our heart and lungs need to move in the shapes that are created when you get that measure of 75 - 85 percent heart rate but I think that how you get it is important. So in "", "" - I'm sorry I went kind of all over the place - In "", ' I was talking about the fact that most people tend to chase the intensity in bodies that are extremely stiff. And that turbulent flow, as I expanded upon later in ', "", the reason that the turbulent flow is an issue is in arteries that don't vasodilate very well. And there seems to be some sort of relationship between the stiffness of a muscle and the stiffness of the artery itself. And that's touched about in maybe a couple of essays and blog posts that are contained in "", "". So we are after pliable parts so that the risk of turbulent flow actually decreases. Because your body should be able to open the blood vessels to mitigate the amount of turbulence. So I don't think that there is a turbulence that is created simply because of the intensity but that the turbulence is created again in this compound issue of an increase in intensity without the ability for your blood vessels to dilate evenly. That there are areas that have plaque - and of course if you already have plaque, that is also a turbulent flow maker. Or if there's stiffness within the artery itself where maybe there can be vasodilation around the stiff area but not in the more stiff or hardened area and thus you kind of create this wonky shape. So the shape of your body that you're bringing to this the 75 percent or 85 percent is more what makes the turbulent flow. So "", ""is a call for really maybe looking at the stiffness of your body or the limitations to that full mobility and maybe even the motions that you're using to create that 75 or 85 percent so that it's doesn't then create this extra turbulence in your blood. So it's like don't only think of your heart needing to be at this certain heart rate. There's other things to think about. So if a person is leading a movement rich life, is already working on a lot of mobility and is looking for those sedentary areas in their body, is already doing in the Hadza study, those small minutes, I think it was 18-20 minutes that was the high-intensity work that's being done.I'm having to pull off the top of my head, I would say maybe 40 minutes of medium intensity within 200 minutes or 300 minutes of light activity. So that would be the context in I guess hunter-gatherer tribes that can be gathered now that have fairly minimal heart disease. Which turbulent flow would be I would say most considered in people who already have risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Turbulent flow I would not imagine would be a huge issue. \xa0And so, again, I am interested in the movements that are associated - the movement of the heart and lungs that are associated with 75-85 percent, more than I am interested in the 75-85 percent itself. So you will see all of that in the next book - which is not coming anytime soon but it will be a place to kind of start synthesizing - that's really "", ', ', ', and ', '. \xa0Because ', "" is really talking about the variables that you've chosen to pull out for scientific investigation are often informing the public whether they know it or not, how they're supposed to shape their behavior. So I do have a paper coming out on this. I will let everyone know when it is out. To talk about we have kind of focused on the whole body state of 75-85 percent or any percentage when you talk about the heart and less about the geometries that coexist between the heart and the lungs and the adaptations of those tissues, both the arteries and also all the musculature both smooth and musculoskeletal that adapt to those sorts of movements. So that was kind of a long answer. Hopefully you can find what you were looking for somewhere in there."", ' which I love. Out of all my minimal shoes they are the most minimal.

This is the final installment in this series on Move Your DNA. Over the last six months I've talked with a variety of experts on movement in the world: how it shapes our bodies, our life, our communities. I talked to "", ' about his self propelled exploration of this planet, and ', ' about how and why she learn to move like a wild animal in nature. ', ' told me everything he knows about moving for wild foraged food, ', "" about how babies move before they're born and how their momma's pelvi do too. About how birth is not the static experience some of us have thought it was. We had conversations about a "", ' and I talked with ', ' about walking the walk. And ', ' and I had a conversation that blew my mind about how our environment shapes us. \xa0You and I took ', "" and contemplated how we're moving and our own expertise about our own bodies. "", ' talked with me about being on the land and how moving for food shapes us, and we talked walkability and urban planning and mobility justice with ', "". And here we are at the end of the line, for now at least. \xa0And what more fitting topic to end this series with than death and the movements that surround it. \xa0If you are a regular listener to Move Your DNA, you probably know that last year moved and shaped me in a way that I've never been moved or shaped before. \xa0In the space of a few weeks I lost three important people in my life. A few months ago I was interviewed on the "", "" (I'll link to that in the show notes) about how my movement rich life influenced that period of time. And as I talked through it I understood. If you've been listening to this podcast for any length of time you know that I tend to verbally process everything. I understood more fully that what we perceive as grief, the experience of grief, could actually just be what grief looks and feels like in a sedentary culture. The culture has a spine, Philip Brass would say it's food and I would say it's also quite possibly movement - those being two inseparable phenomena really. So if you think of movement as a spine of culture and apply that lens to how we grieve, it could be that the way grief feels to us is, in part, because of the sedentary way in which we do it. It's quite possible we've eliminated all of the emotions that have forever been packaged along with physiological processes of grief and so our experiences of it is very specific to our habits and culture. I just got back from a few days in a bird language class with Wilderness Awareness School. And birds and likely other animals do something cool. \xa0After a stressful event of being chased or fighting - in one case there was a family of Jays that all had their freshly hatched babies mauled by a crow. They tremble and they shake to, I image, metabolize what's been released to help them through the event. The movement here is what I'm talking about and I realize that there are a ton of somatic and allopathic therapists out there who already recognize it: movement is part of moving through stressful events. But instead of movement being thought of as just this effective therapy, I pose the idea that every day non-therapeutic movements that are movements found in life is part of the environment grief could be occurring in. Also that there might even be natural movements associated with death we've eliminated, just like many other natural movements. Or said another way, as we shaped our culture in a way that reduced movement for us personally we also got rid of mechanisms that might help us in other ways that are currently off of our radar. I've talked about this before. But, this is very specific. In my "", 'I brought up ceremonial movements like wailing or other vocalizations and also the necessary movements that go into preparing a body for burial or cremation. Even pallbearers, carrying a body after death. Perhaps all of these movements, as well as the movements that used to part of what was necessary to survive is an anatomy, of sorts, in a grieving process. \xa0For those interested in ancestral health, or an evolutionary perspective, this could be another mismatch. In that interview with Mythic Medicine, I also proposed walking grief groups. We talk about walking book clubs and walking dinner parties so why not grief? When I started to look around I found people are already pairing grief and movement in various ways and so today on Move Your DNA we will talk with a couple of people who are making this necessary connection and helping others make it to. \xa0So get ready for that. ', '""In February I broke my left patella in 5 parts and my left radius when I fell down some frozen rocks into a little rivulet and smashed into the frozen rocks on the other side during a downhill winter hike. Three months later I\'m back on my feet but not my knees and found that while my left knee is still hurting if I overuse or over bend, my right kneecap has started making clicking noises and feels funny when I bend it. I am barefoot indoors at home for five years now and started barefoot outdoor part-time two years ago. I changed my and my children\'s footwear to include minimal shoes then. I use information on the internet including your blog but I don\'t own ', 'yet but I have ', ', ', ' (another one of my health problems) and have given ', 'to the goldeners in my family and of course I read it."" Thank you for sharing all those books. ""So here\'s my question: I\'m obviously not walking or moving, for that matter, symmetrically for these last months. I can feel it in my walking and it now shows by wearing down my healthy knee. I guess that my transfer to minimal shoes wasn\'t optimal. I also have a standing desk at work where I try to implement your rules. But obviously I\'m doing something wrong or better said, I have to relearn walking. I pay a lot of attention to how I walk and I feel like I can\'t get it right. And I\'m not a duck. My feet are straight but my knees go inward as my physiotherapist pointed out to me. So which books or alignment snacks can you recommend to help me learn a proper walk?"" And she goes on a little bit more. I\'m just gonna go ahead and start answering it. So sorry! \xa0Ouch! The first thing that pops out at me is it hasn\'t been very long, meaning you had a pretty big tumble and it\'s only been a few months. And so I wouldn\'t want for you to confuse acute issues with kind of chronic or systemic issues. At the same time, I do hear that you\'re noticing the way that you have, in order to keep moving forward, the way that you have to move seems that you have to shift your weight off of the leg that\'s still in a state of repair. And what you\'re noticing is that the leg is needing to do more work now while the other one heals is starting to feel worse for the wear. And I just get that cliche right now. That\'s the first time I\'ve ever actually thought of what those words mean. So you have ', "". So I guess if you were me, what I would do right now would be; scale back what I would call non-therapeutic movement and ramp up therapeutic movement. So I see that ... I read or hear that you're standing at a workstation. I'm not sure how much walking you are doing, but this would be the time where I personally, I can still do the same total of movement, but I would scale it so that the therapeutic movements or the correctives, ones that are meant to support healing and I guess, try to bring that healing leg up to be able to carry the same weight as it did before. I would make that a larger amount of my movement and then reduce some of the larger movements that are in the end really just training that one leg that's having to carry the weight to then become stronger at carrying that weight. \xa0So I'm going to throw out some correctives in the books that you already have: Patella centering, shank rotation, the rectus femoris stretch, and the knee pit alignment. Those four are all in "", "" which you have. So we'll just kind of make those the motions. So if your feet goes straight but your knees go in, that still means that the lower leg, you can think about it in a couple ways, that your knee is not hinging on the same angle as your ankle. So we want those two to match. So that's where that external rotation of the femur comes in, which again, you can find in Move Your DNA. So you're gonna really, if you've been doing those 10 or 15 minutes a day, maybe you're going to be bringing them up to where you're doing them 7 or 8 times a day. Doesn't have to be all at once. But you're just adding them in all of the time. See if you can get 60 to 90 minutes of those smaller movements (again, not in one bout necessarily) but that you are doing lots of mindful restrengthening of that leg. And you can still do both legs. You don't only have to do the leg that's healing. But that you are really mindfully placing conscious loads onto certain tissues and that also maybe you scale back, you know if you're busting out 3 to 5 miles, those could be 3 to 5 miles practicing your old loads. So bring that back a little bit. Or maybe if you're thinking about form while you're walking there is an "", ' which might help you. You might want to scale back on those longer distance loads because maybe if you\'re minding your form, but that leg that\'s healing that\'s tired and for mile 2 through 5 or 3 through 5 you just go back to using that one leg more then that might not be taking you toward the shape that you ultimately want. So maybe instead of standing you sit down more. And your standing workstation, because it is while you can mind your form, sometimes when you\'re standing if you\'re engrossed in work sometimes you stop thinking about it. So that would be my overall recommendation. And then also just give yourself some time. Again, it\'s been a few months and I know, I\'ve been in acute injury and it\'s like, ""Oh my gosh."" because you can\'t see, you don\'t know how long it\'s going to be and there tends to be lots of worry and concern. And you can certainly be proactive. So I just want to make sure that your worry and concern is translating to behaviors that put you where you want to be versus just behaviors within themselves. All right. So that was brought to you by the Collective.', 'Today I am highlighting ', ', maker of beautiful dynamic living space decor.

And a lot of times my perspective is kind of ancestral health practices and even though we are all living, one of the situations of living is that we are often involved in the deaths of others. And so I look at things like what are the sedentary influences on various things. After losing 3 people last year within a few weeks of each other, it really kind of moved death to the forefront of my thoughts about movement and thus this show. And so I found some of your work online. So I wanted to talk to you about what you do. So you lead workshops that teach people how to care for and prepare bodies for funerals and I want to talk a little bit about that as well as what kinds of movement are included or involved in that type of work.', ""DON: Sure. Well, let me give you a little background about myself. I'm 67 years old and I was a funeral director in Los Angeles between the tender ages of 24 to 38. And I gained a lot of experience and insights in doing that work. I left it after 14 years and then returned in a different way to the topic as a home funeral educator."", 'KATY: Ok, so my first question for you is, what is a green burial council?', ""DON: The green burial council is a not for profit group. I believe it's located nowadays in Ojai, California. The Green Burial Council has set down international standards for green burial in private cemeteries, municipal cemeteries so that the public is assured that they are receiving a green burial where the remains go back to the earth in as pure a way and uninterrupted way as possible. So it basically has set up guidelines for the cemetery industry to follow if they're going to tell the public that they provide green burial. \xa0It's a certification council. Their certification has also extended to funeral homes. So if a funeral home wants to attract an eco-conscious consumer they will go through the application process and will be providing eco-friendly products and services."", ""KATY: Ok, so you teach workshops that teach people how to care for and prepare bodies for funerals and that's all done within their home?"", ""DON: Yes. \xa0I teach workshops to empower people to reclaim family and community run home funeral vigils. I'm trying to get away from the word funeral. \xa0Because what we're really referring to is keeping a deceased at home under the guidance and care of a family with a funeral director either completely 100% out of the equation or in the equation. When the funeral director is in the equation, I refer to it as a hybrid funeral. But again, the purpose of my teaching is to empower people with the legalities of doing this work, the logistics of doing this work, and the practical dimensions. So the practical dimensions have to do with handling and safely handling a deceased, transporting a deceased in a vehicle, carrying a deceased, say unwrapping a deceased that comes from a hospital in plastic, the washing or cleansing of a deceased in the most highly, respectable, dignified way possible And there's so many nuances to this work. There's so many challenges. And I'd say the biggest challenge is just being present. And so in my training, it has evolved to the point where I say one of the most important dimensions of doing this, either by yourself or having a funeral director do the things you don't want to do, is self-care. And what I'm referring to is when you get anxious and other's you're working with, we do get anxious, we center ourselves through our breath and calm ourselves, relax the mind, open the heart, and go forward from there. And return to centering whenever it's necessary because it is a very sacred, even beautiful experience being present and lovingly tenderly caring for someone after death."", 'KATY: In your experience, do you find that there is a link between I guess assuming the responsibility and the movement of caring, of processing, of holding this vigil and processing grief?', ""DON: You know, I want to make something clear. I have great experience as a funeral director over a period close to 15 years, meeting with tens of hundreds of grieving families, caring for tens of hundreds of deceased people/bodies. \xa0As far as having a thriving practice of being a home funeral guide or being a death doula, it's been limited because the demand is not really strong and I don't have strong entrepreneurial skills in going out doing this doing that. My focus has been on taking my experience and training people to assume responsibilities of their own loved ones. But to answer your question about a link between this movement work, this activity of tenderly - tenderly assuming these responsibilities and tenderly caring for a loved one - and that effect upon one's grief. I don't think you have to have a lot of experience at all to understand that in moving and in caring and in being present to caring for a deceased, that the activity will start to dissolve your difficult emotions and so yes, there is a link. And I think it's very logical that when we do get involved in the way that I teach and what we're referring to here, yes, there will be healing."", 'KATY: You had mentioned that you had spent quite a bit of time as a funeral director in your 20s and 30s. What made you come back to, I guess, death work and why did you choose this green path instead. This idea of empowering people to do some of this work themselves?', "" in Canada where students come to learn the legalities and the logistics and get practical experience in caring for a mock deceased. Because we can talk about legalities and logistics and how good this is and so on and so forth but it's in the doing that we really get the hands-on experience. And so my workshops are specifically task oriented. In other words, you either die at home and are cared for there or you die outside the home. And if you want to have a deceased brought back into the home, well certainly you can contract a funeral director to do it and there's nothing wrong with that. Or if you want to go off the grid, so to speak, you can actually, where it's legal in what province and what states it's legal you can actually do it yourself and gain the sense of sovereignty- this freedom to assume this very human responsibility. And then, either with a funeral director or yourself, bring a deceased into the home and doing cleansing and shrouding or dressing and laying out, whether in the bed for a couple of days or three days or maybe a day or in a casket or some other appropriate spot that really works, you have time to accept the death. You have time to grieve. You have this 24/7 opportunity to go into the bedroom where the person is laying in honor, or whenever in the house or in the casket or what have you, to do the work to say the things you want to say or to simply sit in their presence to absorb what has happened. So this whole thing about the home funeral vigil, home funeral movement, home funeral vigil experience is all about time to be present with the deceased in order to accept the finality and do so \xa0in such a way that you move through a lot of grief."", ""KATY: I have to apologize because I'm weeping as you're talking. \xa0And I was fortunate enough to have that with my dad. And only going through one parent's death, I don't have anything to compare it to. But I did appreciate having a day to crawl in bed with him even after he had passed away to talk to him and hold his hands and to go back and brush his hair and rub oil on his body. And I believe that was very integral to how I perceived the event. So anyway I just wanted to say thank you for the work that you do because I don't... you don't hear people at least in this culture, talking about death and the role of death as a human activity. It seems to always be a scary - uh - it just has such a negative connotation. And given that it's something that we will all experience ourselves, both while we are living and then something that's inevitable, I just appreciate that you are speaking about it and also the way that you are speaking about it. \xa0So about your workshops, logistically are they one day? Or is it a weekend or a week long? What's the logistics behind how someone, if they're interested, could come to you and what you teach? "", 'KATY: Right.', ""DON: And you can do it. \xa0And you can't do it alone. And you shouldn't do it alone. So now that opens up a whole other discussion. If this work is too much to do alone then obviously we have to do it in relationship and we have to do it in community. And we don't have these structures in our culture because we're no longer tribal. We're no longer communal. However, there are communities, intentional communities, spiritual communities, religious communities that do care for their own in death. But for the rest of us it's really difficult. \xa0And so for myself, I'll give you an example somewhat of a solution for myself. I have been participating in a men's circle for almost 6 years and we meet every other Thursday and we have between 8 and 12 of us. So I'm well bonded. We're all well bonded. And we've reached a point maybe a year ago where I said, and others said, you know we're capable of caring for each other as we die and after death. And lets just commit to that. So there's a circle I've educated. I've put on a weekend training for these brothers of mine. \xa0And I'm going to be doing it for a particular church community in Victoria. And so this is kind of the direction this needs to go in because we can't do it alone and, I mean if you're grieving the loss of someone you shouldn't really be in there. It energetically, emotionally, psychologically, be in there do all of this work because it could be too much and generally for most all of us, it is too much. And so it's important to be part of a community that has training."", ""KATY: I was just thinking in my mind, we live in a small town and we definitely have a community - not an intentional community. We're not really bonded in any particular paradigm as much as we just see each other so regularly and share so many of life things: meals, parenting strategies, fiscal responsibility, car lending, all these things... and it just occurred to me. One of us could go take this training and one of us could at least, for the other 50 or 60 people in this group, kind of at least facilitate. To almost be ... it wouldn't be the same as actually training with you directly or receiving the training but it would definitely help, you know, in have at least taking a glimpse at all of the options. So I like the idea that it can be done in a community in whatever way you personally define community."", ""DON: Yes. And you know, when I started doing this work 3 years ago, I didn't want to do it alone as a teacher and so I began with a colleague of mine. And she prefers to remain anonymous because she's changed her line of work. Back then people were very concerned, is it legal? \xa0That's pressing. So what I do is I just make copies of public documents and laws and regulations that govern care of the dead and filing documents and transporting documents and I show it. That was the major concern. Is it legal? And if we're to do it ourself then tell us where do we go to file the paperwork? How do we - what kind of request do we make to get hold of the death certificate and the permit for burial and cremation and the transport. That was big and it still is a core part of my work. However, a lot of people who focus in on this work or this responsibility have gotten beyond the legality of it. \xa0And what they really want from my training is they want the hands-on experience of being present to a mock model. And I'll tell you these mock models they play dead very well. And the handling. The turning. And being present and centering oneself. And the dressing. And the vigiling. And I have to share, even though we do these mock exercises, when everybody is so focused and so loving and so caring and keeps on returning to center, when we just stand before this mock deceased, the silence that comes over, the energy that comes over is precious. Is from a spiritual point of view, divine. It's almost as if the portal between this world, the physical world, and the spiritual world opens. And isn't that the truth about the great transition into this world; birth. Doesn't the portal open? And then the great transition to the spiritual world; death. The portal opens. \xa0So I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the work that we're all doing reclaiming family and community death care is in alignment with our deepest self. With the ground of our being. With the creative force of life that existed before creation even happened. It's very real, healing work. And I'm so thrilled that our, here in North America, we are getting into this because we're going to influence our children and generations to come in a positive way so they live less death neurotic lives and more life positive lives with death in its proper place and their relationship to death in a healthy place."", 'KATY: Don, I want to thank you so much for being my guest on Move Your DNA, but also just for being a great human doing necessary work ultimately that serves many beyond you. \xa0You can find more about Don Morris and his work with Home Funeral training at ', '. \xa0Thanks so much, Don.', 'DON: Thank you, Katy.', 'BRIANNA: \xa0Hi Katy! Thanks for having me on.', ""KATY: So I am just ecstatic to hear about what you offer and checked out what you offer and your Instagram right away because I felt like I had stumbled upon this idea of grief being a natural movement so I'm always relieved when other people have been thinking about things long before I have. So I want to talk with you today about "", "" And let's start with what helped you make the connection between grief and movement and why did you start offering Wild Grief camps?"", ""BRIANNA: \xa0That's kind of an interesting and long story. I'll tell you the short version. Basically, the founders of Wild Grief had a few things in common. We'd all experienced the death of an important person in our lives either in our childhood or in adulthood or as parents and we'd all been volunteering to support kids and families who were grieving which is where we met. And then we all kind of independently had a deep connection to nature. That was a really important part of our life. And in that volunteer work that we do with the support groups and the camps for grieving kids, we notice that the times where those kids were outdoors, their grief work really took on a new dimension. And there was something about it that just seemed kind of more transformational. And we had, also, our personal experiences of being outdoors, having that kind of hike, physical, exertion be a kind of deeper kind of connection to our inner selves and our inner grief. So we really wanted to spend more time and put more attention on that aspect of being outdoors and depending on your body to move you place to place and take care of yourself. And then one other piece, because we've been working in particular with teens over time, it can be very challenging to convince a group of teens to come sit into a room and talk with strangers about grief and hard stuff but having something where they're going backpacking, they're learning a skill, they're being outdoors, takes a little of that pressure off and gives them a lot more space to be able to share what they want and what they need to when they're ready."", ""KATY: It's so interesting because I've always thought of grief support as talking as being the essential part of the process. So do you think that there's also something intrinsic in this movement of walking, and I'm not sure - we can talk a little bit more if you're backpacking or is this day hikes. Is it the group dynamic that's helping these grievers, maybe specific these teens move through this experience? Is talking necessary? Or is it all of it combined?"", "". And that is the second Sunday of every month we have a two-hour walk in rain or shine in parts local to us in the south Puget Sound region. \xa0And that experience we begin - we bring people together. We begin with an opening circle and people get a chance to share why they're there that day. \xa0Who they're remembering or what part of the grief journey that they're on. And then the first 10 minutes of the hike are really walking in silence together as a group. And we ask everyone to kind of honor that silence as a group. Which is a different experience than silence walking by yourself. And then after that 10 minutes, it's very interesting. Some people stay in silence, some people move into small group conversations and they talk about everywhere from their really intense grief experience to what else they're doing that weekend. Right? \xa0There's no real prescriptive piece about it but it's a chance to acknowledge we're here together, talk about our grief, walking through our grief. And then we come back and we have a closing circle and we leave. It's just really - it's amazing to see the transformation even with just a two-hour experience has for the people because there's something about acknowledging that we're carrying this big heavy thing and we're going on this grief journey together. And then actually physically take a journey together - even if it's a short one - you can really see it in people's faces and in their affects over the courses of those two hours. So that's kind of our regular program and then we do a "", "", usually one in the spring and one in the fall which is just more the extended version of that. So we go somewhere like Mount St. Helens or Mount Rainier and we take a whole day to spend together, have lunch together, really make it kind of a longer, bigger experience with a few more activities. \xa0And those too are for all community members so all ages. And then we also do youth programs which is for ages 13-19 which is a backpacking trip where we do teach the skills of really learning to be backpackers to move your bodies to take care of yourself in the wilderness in addition to addressing your grief. And that one, again, talking is a piece of that process \xa0but there are a lot of other things that we do and activities that we do that help people move through that. And I think the richness in an experience like that is the metaphor that you can draw from the actual experience of doing that work. We're not asking for experienced backpackers to come on those trips for those teens and we supply all the gear and material. So they don't have to worry about coming up with all that stuff. So for example, the first day our theme is grief is hard and it can hurt and it can be discouraging. And that first day on the trails as they're heading uphill, probably for someone on their very first backpacking experience, carrying this heavy pack and trying to figure out what it means to sleep outside ... so we are really trying to make those links between the physical experience and what can feel like to be in grief. It really opens up a lot more avenues to explore what grief is and how to normalize it for those kids."", 'KATY: I\'ve been nodding so much my neck is sore. I can hear my brain is synthesizing things that I\'ve learned at nature awareness school and things that I\'ve learned working with various occupational therapists about sensory integration and medium of nature. And then this - it\'s not a metaphor - it\'s that we\'re often not used to doing things that are hard and moving through those processes in the modern life context - to kind of live out the physical not related to your grief experience and you\'re like, ""oh, I\'ve gone from unsuspecting to hard to surviving"" and you just keep doing that over and over again until you get skilled at it. So thank you for tying all those pieces together for me.', 'BRIANNA: \xa0Mm-hmm.', ""KATY: My next question was, I think something that you already answered but maybe there's some other elements to tease out here: What have you observed from the teens and adults who are participating in the group hikes. And I'm not sure if it's like what are the changes for them? \xa0Maybe clinical measures perhaps, but is there anything self-reported or observations that you've made about people who have attended these Wild Grief gatherings?"", ""BRIANNA: \xa0Yeah, so we've had so far, because we're a pretty new organization, we've only had the "", ' and the ', "". And this summer's our first time with teens. But I can tell you a little bit about what I've seen on our hike habits and our day hikes. And I did mention it a little bit but it's really interesting to me, and one of our, kind of our vision with Wild Grief, is to create a vital, resilient, and connected community with a healthy response to death. And one of the ways we do that is that kind of normalization of death is a part of our life even though in our western culture we try not to admit that."", 'KATY: Right.', 'BRIANNA: \xa0We put it in a box. \xa0And it\'s something that happens to someone else. Until you\'re really in it and then you can feel really lost and lack of support. So I think for that one of the things we\'ve really noticed is people arrive at the trailhead for a hike habit or a day hike and you can feel that nervous energy where a group of people who don\'t know each other, they\'re coming together, and they\'re gonna be talking about this big personal thing of they\'re in pain. Which is not something we share with anyone most of the time, much less a group of strangers. \xa0And so that sense, watching that as the arrival and the kind of nervous funny giggles, right? And just in that opening circle moment when they share that piece and you see the almost physically like a thread of connection between all these people. Where they all have a story. And they don\'t necessarily tell the story but it\'s just an acknowledgment that they\'re holding that story. And then just that kind of movement, it just opens up that space for people to dive into those deep conversations. So you can be walking along someone on the trail talking about what you had for breakfast and then all of a sudden you can be like ""And then my dad died and it changed my whole relationship with food because he was a chef."" \xa0So you can just dive into this crazy thing.', 'KATY: Yeah.', ""BRIANNA: \xa0And it's fine because you're together and acknowledging it. And there's something about walking next to someone versus this sitting down with them an looking them in the eye. That makes it a little more comfortable to be able to talk about that."", 'KATY: Yeah.', ""BRIANNA: \xa0\xa0And then you can really see by the closing circle just the tension in people's bodies, partly from the walk and the actual movement but it just melts away and they experience some of that emotion but because there was that forward motion, you don't have that feeling of getting stuck. So by the end of the hike when we have our closing circle, whatever piece of emotion that they touched and brought up, they've kind of had that chance to move through it and hold it in a different way. And then by the end, they're just a little bit more relaxed. They're still holding this heavy thing of grief, but there was a chance to speak to it and a chance to connect with other people and with nature. Our last hike that I was a part of, we talked about that concept of forest bathing and just what a feeling it was. It was pouring rain that day too so kind of multidimensional forest bathing, but they just really have a sense of relaxation and kind of relief after going through just that two-hour experience. So our first "", "" we've all worked with kids in a lot of ways, the people who formed this group. But we haven't stacked those specific things of grief support and nature and movement and building their confidence in their bodies and what work they can do to take care of themselves and building that community. So I think that that ... our hope is that it's going to be one of the touchstone experiences for these kids for their life overall because I think it has the possibility to be transformational in a lot of ways. And transformational or even just a chance to spend four days with other people talking about this hard thing, it just gives you that space to explore it where we don't have that space when we're back in our day to day lives."", ""KATY: It's so interesting that we use the term holding space. And it's often such a sedentary concept because it can mean a time, a chair in a room, eye to eye contact. The idea that holding space can literally be wide open space, I think is a different way of thinking about this term. And certainly it applies in all the context but I'm just thinking now of therapeutic scenarios that I've been in and it's so much eye to eye, direct, uncomfortable, sometimes."", 'BRIANNA: \xa0Yes.', 'KATY: It can be intimidating to have to kind of deal with these very deep things. Someone is making eye contact with you and looking and waiting expectantly. And also with kids, my own kids, having lots of siblings, that face to face can sometimes be defense making - maybe just naturally - maybe direct eye contact can read that way for some animals in certain states...', 'BRIANNA: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: If I walk alongside my kids and they're just doing their own thing, they're much more likely - or my partner - for that matter - much more likely to just allow things to come up because I don't feel like I'm being confronted. It's just more space to facilitate this babbling brook of whatever comes up. \xa0So I like the idea of the bigger the therapy office, so to speak, the more it can fill because the more directions everything and everyone can go. You had also mentioned this notion of self-care. And this has come up for me a few times. Grief is, I think, such a sedentary experience. I mean if you think about it in movies it can be, you know, drawn curtains. Everyone in the house is sitting. Maybe not even getting out of bed when you're really in the depths of grief. So self-care - even the most basic things like going outside and being in the sunshine or in a rain forest, perhaps, or simply moving your body, I think that, or I'm wondering are these being viewed as self-indulgent at a time when you are supposed to be grieving. Do you think that there's this feeling that you're not honoring others - in this case, your departed - in some way if you continue to attend to your own needs, to care for and about yourself? \xa0"", ""BRIANNA: \xa0Right. I think there's a lot to that idea. And of the having to just put all your attention on the person who died and closing up. And I think a part of that is in our western culture we've lost some of those, I think in America in particular, we've lost kind of that sense of ritual around specific things. Or what is the work that you do around grief? Because we're very individualistic and so we've just kind of, you've got to be strong. You got to not show that you're vulnerable. And you just don't have a job to do. "", ""KATY: \xa0Yeah, I think that the work that you're doing is fantastic. \xa0I just feel like there's minds exploding all over as people listen to the work that you're doing. It really seems to be tying many threads together: vitamin nature, and grief work, and holistic approaches, and ancestral health, and all these community pieces that we're re-integrating slowly over time. I definitely want to point listeners to your website, to your Instagram. Do you have any other resources that you feel are exceptional?"", ""BRIANNA: \xa0I think, there aren't a ton of programs specifically like ours where that very driven nature and grief but there are other places where you can find grief support specifically for children and families that I think would be great for people to be able to look up all over the country. So for example, the National Alliance for Grieving Children has a list of programs that you can connect with all over the country. And there are places like the Moyer Foundation which funds Camp Aaron which is a camp for kids who are grieving and that happens in a lot of places across the country as well. And that gets ... I think Camp Aaron is where we really got inspired because we saw those kids in an outdoor context and we just wanted more and more of that. So I think those places would be great resources. And of course I have a million so I can share a few of those for your show notes so people can look up and see what might be helpful for them."", 'KATY: Thank you so much. Thank you for taking time away from your very important work to come speak with me on this podcast.', 'BRIANNA: \xa0Thank you so much, Katy. It was fun to talk this through with you.', ""KATY: Thanks to Breanna Trygg of Wild Grief. You can find out more about that group's work and get the details on some of their upcoming hikes and events at WildGrief.org. And we will link to them as well as additional resources in our show notes."", ""Amy, congratulations! \xa0You know, that's a good question. It's really hard because I don't necessarily think that there are five or ten or even twenty moves that could be better than a different list of 5 or 10 or 20 because it really depends on the person coming and what they're bringing with their own body and the intentions that they have for those moves. In general, I think what I would say - because I'm about to say it - is think now about carrying. So if I had to break it down into three categories that would be your personal comfort right now carrying your mass that's going to be slowly increasing. So it's a training program. Pregnancy is a training program and it's beautiful in the fact that the mass acquisition is gradual which is how you design a training program, right? You don't go to the gym and somebody gives you a 40-pound kettlebell. You're going to start with something light and then you're gonna practice your form with it and then you're able to add more weight and less momentum if you do it gradually. \xa0So, human physiology has been doing it since the beginning and there's actually a couple blog posts about it. So if you can manage your standing and walking form so that the back side of your body is able to receive and adapt to this slowly accumulating weight that's gonna help you feel comfortable. It also is going to set up the stage for being able to carry that maybe same mass, although redistributed, in your arms, no longer part of your personal frame any longer - it's not only keeping you fit and healthy during pregnancy but for what comes afterwards. So mind your standing and walking form. So Walk This Way is a good alignment snack. And of course you're working on hip and leg mobilization - the pieces that are in the pelvic region. Obviously they have jobs to perform and you want to make sure that mobility is there - and stability both. So if you listen to the"", "" so that you have this ability to change the shape of your container. So there's also this idea that the baby is supposed to be getting a certain amount of movement for its optimal development. So they're just starting to recognize that if it doesn't have that mobility that there's going to be maybe effects that are happening to its tissues as they're developing and thus setting a container of movement for their life. So moving a lot in general and I would just say vary your position a lot. \xa0I know these aren't the specific exercises but they're more the large overall movements. Getting up and getting down. Getting on your hands and knees. Standing up and repeating that. All of that is movement and agitation of the container which then is perhaps part of the stimulation of the baby to be moving itself. So think of varying your position a lot, minding your form when you're moving so that all of your body gets to carry your weight. And then if you have any areas that are kind of bothering you, niggling you, kind of figure out how to move those a little bit more or with a little bit more control. So again, this is a period of time where you can enjoy your physical prowess. Again to me I always felt that being pregnant was such an athletic time. It was like a personal training session that you couldn't get out of. A really long personal training session. So again, congratulations and good luck."", 'I do love to answer your questions and I love our Dynamic Collective made up of Soft Star, MyMayu, UnShoes, Earthrunners, and Venn Design. \xa0They sponsor the question and answer part of each episode of this Move Your DNA series.

And these blog posts eventually became a chapter in ', "" called Feet and Shoes (and what gets stacked onto them).And it’s kind of fun to read back on some of these essays because I can see myself working out various ideas on the whole barefoot/minimal shoes movement that hadn’t taken off then like it has now. It is still very counterculture, but I'd say it's less so 10 years later. And it's because so many people have worked out the ideas beyond the kind of very general “barefoot's natural!

First essay:', 'Here\'s another article I wrote on foot/pelvis/balance. Are you bored yet? This one is from July\'s LA Yoga magazine (and this must have been in 2010). Perhaps the most important piece of the article is this 60/40 rule of weight bearing explained. Enjoy. If the Shoe Fits. By Katy Bowman. \xa0That\'s me. After you\'ve twisted lunged lengthened and lined, focused, prepared, repaired and reset, you must get off the mat. The notion of bringing a yoga practice to the rest of your daily life, the part that takes place between classes, can improve personal relationships, success at work, and your shoe rack by improving your relationship with your feet. Postures that require grounding action in the feet, increased range of motion of the toes, full lengthening of the arch, are a delicious part of any practice. \xa0These foot movements are both challenging and especially rich in sensation because of the sheer quantity of time we spend not using our feet. ""The human foot, according to Leonardo Da Vinci, is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art."" Made up of 25% of the body\'s bones and muscles and articulating around 33 joints, our feet have the potential to subtly change shape at each joint, thus sending valuable information to the body\'s center of mass located in the pelvis. The tiny stretches in between every one of the foot\'s 26 bones are a gold mine of proprioception that allows the pelvis to make 3-dimensional positional adjustments. Optimal foot health, however, has been compromised in a very large way due to the heavy use of footwear over a lifetime. Different characteristics of various types of footwear have unique effects on physiology and mechanics. The limitations footwear places on motion of the foot, along with motion of the ankle, knee, hip, and sacrum are not equal across all types of shoes. The healthiest footwear is one that interferes little with your natural body movements. Barefoot is best. It would be unfair to discuss footwear without clearly stating that ultimate foot health is optimally reached through full shoeless interaction between nature and foot. Foot health can become compromised, however, when you walk on unyielding man-made surfaces that may or not be speckled with broken glass and other dangerous items. Small doses of being barefoot, and wearing socks is ok too, can be done in your home. Just make sure that the jacks are picked up before you do. (And I would also say lego, right?) Minimalist footwear brands like Vibram five fingers are also great options for using your feet. Before you go baring it all, keep in mind that the supporting structures of the feet have been, for the most part, inert the bulk of your life. Loading fresh arches on long walks after removing a lifetime of support can stress and strain tissues. \xa0It is important to think about building strength of the musculature of the feet, just like we would do any other part of your body. Start with smaller doses of barefoot walking and make sure you do lots of foot stretching in between walking sessions. Pamper your feet which will help them be happier as they cart you around. A coconut oil foot massage and non-toxic pedicure can be a mini-vacation as Southern California heats up and drys out this summer. Eliminate the heel. Not quite ready to go au naturel? Shoes that closely mimics barefoot walking such as Earth Footwear\'s negative heel technology can really drive home the ""weight should be in your heel"" feeling. Podiatric journals have recently become riddled with articles illustrating that for every positive degree of heel (so for a point of reference, the one inch found on a man\'s dress shoe creates an average angle of 12 degrees) there is a resulting angle of deformation in the lumbar spine, pelvis, knees, and or ankle. There is no footwear characteristic that jars one more out of whole body alignment faster than the positive heel. If a dress shoe creates 12 positive degrees, just think of what a stiletto can do to deform the rest of the body. Pause and consider choosing well before selecting footwear that undoes all your hard work and increases mechanical stress on a cellular level. Spread the toes. Toe abduction or a movement of the toes away from each other is a normal part of a healthy gait pattern. Years of carrying weight too far forward on the feet, wearing too small shoes as a kid (does anyone else out there live in hand me downs) and narrow toe boxes on certain shoe styles have really limited the toe spreading motion. Selecting footwear that provides ample room to splay your toes when walking is the healthiest choice. Ideally, our toes should be able to spread just as the fingers do. If tight toes have become a habit, foot alignment socks (and you can find those at ', ' or also there are non-sock toe spacers called ', "" - I can link to those in the show notes) can work on spreading them for you. The perfect product for the hardcore alignment freak which is me, you can load muscle and fascial tissues while you sleep. Brilliant. \xa0Be attached to your shoes. It is surprising how quickly the flip-flop has moved beyond the favorite pool accessory to the ultimate fashion staple. In California, I totally get it, although I think the New York professionals seeing may still be in shock. (I can just say to the side, as someone who has gone around and done a lot of press interviews on why bare feet and why flat shoes for the New York health magazines, it is definitely regional, I would say, the acceptance of minimal shoes. There's just a different professional environment.) Flip flops are still usually enjoyed for their lack of restriction. Lots of fresh air and minimal friction and they're also time friendly. You don't have time to find matching socks and bend down and tie your shoes, flip-flop may be your guy. The only negative to this bikini of footwear is the fact that it doesn't stay on your foot without some major muscle clenching and bony alteration. Research on gait patterns in poorly attached shoes demonstrates increased risk for hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, and knee pain. I say keep your favorite flops around for water and beach activities and invest in a newer roman style sandal that offers the same open air feel but with better binding. \xa0Weight in your feet. Where is the best place to carry the weight in your feet for optimal foot health? The oft given instruction for correct weight bearing in the foot usually sites the 60/40 rule which is wildly misinterpreted as 60% of the body's weight back in the heel and 40% towards the front of the foot. This weigh distribution, however, is not actually correct and the reason comes down to the actual scientific definitions of commonly used terminology. So the term weight means the result of the vertical force - gravity - acting on the body's mass. So in order to achieve a 60/40 weight distribution, your center of mass would have to shift forward removing the plumb alignment of the hips, knees, and ankles. This forward motion creates torque not only on the ankle but also on the lower spine and sacroiliac joints. The optimal place to carry one's body weight is actually toward the center of the heel bone. Keeping the weight of the pelvis over the ankle joint is the only way to ensure a straight leg and a healthy lumbar curve. However, having 100% of your weight over your heel does not mean that the front of the foot is inactive. With the pelvis centered on a plumb line relative to the ankles, the forefoot, which is the front of the foot, but not the toes, can now actively press into the ground. So the action of backing up the hips to ground the heels while simultaneously pressing the forefoot into the ground creates an active force generating interaction with the earth. This is so much better for the body than passively thursting the hips forward. An effective yoga practice is one that improves one's mindfulness, not only on the mat but for the countless choices one has to make every day. When you understand the impact your shoes can have not only on your feet but on your entire body, then choosing mindfully means selecting the footwear, or lack of footwear that is most appropriate for your highest goals for yourself. When I envision my highest goals, healthy feet, knees, hips, and spine are always in the picture for as long as I'm going to be using this body. That doesn't mean you won't catch me in flip flops when I'm down by the beach in Maui. It just means every step I take will honor the works of art that I am stepping on."", ""\xa0If you take your body weight and distribute it between the front of your foot - it's like a passive distribution. If I let my hips go way out in front of me I can say that I can read on a pressure sensor underneath my foot that I've got a certain amount of pressure in the back of my heel and a certain amount of pressure in the front or I'm carrying my weight distributed over both feet. So again, what you're reading is the ground. You're reading the ground's response to what's on top of it. But if I back my heels up, I've got all my weight over my heels now which means I've got this, I'm using more musculature to hold me up actively in this case, the front of my foot is still pressing down into the ground. Which means I can have pressure in the front and the back of my foot. Meaning even with my weight entirely over my heel I still have pressure in the front of my foot but that pressure is active, meaning I am plantar flexing. That's the motion of pointing your toes. I'm pointing my toes into the ground which means the front of my foot is active in the ground. So if I'm reading the sensor beneath my feet, there is still pressure in the front of my foot when my hips are all the way backed up. It's just that I had to get that actively via using my calves. So when my weight's back in my heels the front of my foot is actively pressing down so I've got a lot of work in my glutes and my hamstrings and my calves, versus that same distribution of weight between the front and the back of my leg gotten simply by shifting my weight all the way forward to the front of my foot. So sometimes there's different ways of getting the same measure. \xa0You want more weight in the back of your foot than the front but I can get that through action versus getting it passively. I'm not sure if that makes it any more clear, but I'm glad we had this conversation."", 'Barefoot. Not just for adults. This is from July 11, 2011.', 'Yesterday my niece stepped on her first nail. She survived. And I know she survived because I got this text from my sister: ""Survived Rae\'s first nail through foot. She is doing fine."" And then I texted: ""Yay, just like mama. \xa0Only I have an iphone so it corrected it to ""just like mana"" because everybody knows that the word mana is more popular than the word mama. And then she texted back: ""Dada"". And I\'m not sure why. Did her husband step on a nail too as a kid? Did one of her 47 kids have her phone? Had she forgotten when she stepped on her first nail? \xa0So I texted: ""No, you did that too. I remember the very moment."" And I did too. She was about nine and on the phone, probably talking to a boy when she shifted her weight forward onto a piece of wood with a nail in it. Just reading this I\'m like eh, man. And here\'s the funny thing. She didn\'t hang up the phone. No. I remember she was trying to keep the conversation going with stuff about how she had a nail in her foot. She really liked talking on the phone. And she remembered too because then she texted: ""Yes."" And then she wrote: ""Barefoot in the apple hut."" Only here\'s the thing. She wasn\'t barefoot. She was wearing black keds and I remember because when they pulled the nail out of the foot/shoe, the shoe filled up with blood. It was cool. Probably because it wasn\'t my foot. So then I texted back: ""No you weren\'t barefoot. It went through your shoe and you were on the phone."" And when I read my text I can see why my little sister thinks I was bossy as a kid. Only as a kid, right sis? \xa0Plus, texting always makes me sound like I\'m twelve. And then she texted back: ""Hurt like a mother."" And then I texted: ""I bet."" And then we stopped texting because 1) I have a new baby and a whole bunch of other stuff I should be doing, 2) she has 67 kids and a whole bunch of other things she should be doing. 3) we are over 35 now and why are we even texting in the first place. So, let\'s talk for a second about the barefoot movement. In a nutshell, feet weren\'t designed to be in shoes any more than hands were designed to be in mittens. Our cultural habit of wearing shoes has left us with affluent ailments - osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, knee/hip/back pain, bunions - at much higher percentages than unshod populations. And you don\'t have to be a genius but you might be to go yeah, I get it. With kids, it\'s even more important that they get abundant barefoot time because the proper development of natural gait patterns and deep body stabilization depends on the super sophisticated feedback systems that come from the nerve sensing the ground and the brain. \xa0This happens in two ways. One, there are nerves that interpret the shape of the ground by how the bones in the feet bend at 33 different points or joints. This creates a mental imagine in the brain, similar to how a dolphin uses sonar to avoid obstacles. Wearing shoes prevents any motion of these joints except at the ankle and leaves the shoe wearer kind of blind to the environment. This is what makes stiff shoes worse when it comes to natural development. And P.S., this goes for adults too. Two, There are nerves that are sensing other things about the environment. Things like temperature and terrain. And these nerves, designed to convey abundant information are stuck just reading the inside of your shoes. And what is that environment like? Damp and smooth. Eew. The more you expose these nerves to the same input over and over, the more their information gets put on autopilot into a part of your nervous system called an interneuron. And here\'s more about the interneuron. You know how you walk into a room with freshly baked pie and it smells delicious but after a few minutes, you don\'t smell it anymore? \xa0Your brain moves the information that is constant into a different part of your brain to free it up for other things so that the more similar your environment, the less your nerves work to perceive. And the less they work, the less healthy they are. This is why it\'s important for everyone, not just kids, to walk on different terrain, on a different path, in different weather, carrying different weights wearing different shoes, eating different food. Habits are not great for biology. Anyhow, this is why everyone, kids too, need lots of time to feel with their feet. Make the house a no shoes zone and encourage exploration of different areas sans footwear. I brought up the nail in the foot conversation because, yes, accidents happen. But in the case of my sister and her little girl, they were wearing shoes. Wearing shoes doesn\'t prevent the few foot catastrophes that happen. And wearing shoes only teaches kids how to pay less attention to what\'s going on beneath their feet. Not that\'s not to say there aren\'t going to be places where kids need shoes. And when they do, here are a few suggestions: 1) Select super flexible shoes with no heels. My favorite company for better kids footwear is SoftStar Shoes. Keep in mind shoes get expensive and it\'s important not to let kids wear shoes that are too small. This is where toe curling habits get started. So before you run out to the store right now, don\'t buy fancy shoes in the summer. Kids will grow a lot this season and will probably not fit into their shoes at the end of the season. Summer is also the best time to be barefoot so maximize barefoot time right now. \xa0The best footwear is actually, and I\'m not kidding a swim shoe. They\'re lightweight and flexible and breathable and super inexpensive. Get your kids a pair at the beginning of the summer to supplement their barefoot time and donate the ones that are too short. Maybe even get the next size up if they\'re available for fall if you live in a tempered climate. Swim shoes are much better than flip flops for the gait changes that we do to keep flip flops on and they really mess with the natural gait pattern. And here\'s an interesting note. Some neurologists will often recommend wearing swim shoes year round for kids with any sort of neurological delay as it improves the neurological function of the feet for better gait which is the walking pattern development. So why only improve the gait of some kids? Let\'s do it all, shall we? 3) Play foot detective games. Having your kids in their bare feet? Try having them guess various objects by using their feet only. The more the textures vary, wet, smooth, sandpaper, yoga mat, carpet, wood, the more the game will challenge their sensory nerves. 4) Have a little foot massage time before going to bed. Just like book reading, add a five minute rub into the bed time tasks. Skin on skin touch will help stimulate the movement of each foot joint increasing circulation of the foot\'s issues. P.S. touch is just so great. ', ""So it's not always easy to make a very strong pro/con list about, like, going barefoot. Like, if (that's a lot of likes. Sorry, I'm from California). If your only item on a list of should I go barefoot or not are the injuries or the dangers and you're not super clear on the, I guess the chances of those dangers then it's easy to perceive being barefoot as something that's very dangerous, risky, has no benefit whatsoever. But when you add the pros to the barefoot list, which involve movement and it's not just movement of the feet itself but really the ability to engage in more complex environments just moving. That's not even to say all of the other benefits that have come out about barefoot and nature and that exchange. There's more and more I would say coming all of the time to pay attention to. So just - I include that one specifically because there is a relationship between what you do to protect yourself and sometimes a loss of skill. So when everyone has worn shoes for a very very long time and has never been taught to pay attention to their feet or what they walk on, it kind of creates a culture where there's a certain disconnect between... I mean there's a loss of the skill, frankly, for barefoot, but then there's just kind of a lack of awareness overall and therefore you're more likely, perhaps, to not be as invested in keeping an area clean or garbage free or you won't be as mindful as where you let your animal go to the bathroom because it hadn't occurred to you that you are sharing space with other people that might want to be using their body in a different way than what you've chosen. I've been reading a lot and watching a lot of work about bureaucratic land management, BLMs, ways of managing multi-use spaces when there's different animals and different needs shared by a particular space. So as someone who likes to go barefoot a lot, I would say I'm super mindful about how I use my space when I'm not barefoot. So, I don't know. I included that because I think that there's the idea that if you just keep your shoes on everything's gonna be all right. And I don't know if that's the case."", 'VOICEOVER: If you’re into podcasts it’s likely you love the audio format. \xa0If you like listening to Katy read from her book ', ', you should know she has three audiobooks, and she’s willing to read them to you anytime you want.

He was already shoe and sock free most of the time but every morning I had to watch him lose traction on the linoleum or falter when walking because the grip between the floor and his feetie pajamas was too much. I'm not a big crafty lady but give me some scissors and a math equation and I'm there. Feetie pajamas minus feetie equal pajamas. \xa0If you have a kid you've probably witnessed the way each of their fingers move in a slow, yet definite manner when the child is trying to pick up an object big or small. Kids are working hard to wire their muscles to their brain and to do this they need full use of their sensory and motor nerves. Footie pajamas allow foot movement but they completely minimize the ability for the foot skin to read the environment and this data, when collected, helps establish a relationship between the foot and every other body part that can last a lifetime. The feet have the same amount of motor potential as the hands, \xa0yet we don't think much about slapping on a big fuzzy slipper when babies are learning their first movements. This is why we all have the foot problems we do and this is why my footwriting is distinctively less impressive than my handwriting. And to be fair, my handwriting is not great. In children, motor programs are being set every day and it is very very hard to undo the deepest, read earliest, motor programs we acquire. If kids take their first steps in socks on a slippery floor, they'll tense a bunch of extra muscles and that gets put into their walking mental file. And if you want to try it, put on some fuzzy socks while on hardwood or check out how you tense various parts of your body when negotiating an icy part of your sidewalk. Bracing against slipping is a reflex. And what you don't want a child to do is to learn bracing and put it into their walking file. This kind of overrides their natural reflex for gait development. Even if your kids isn't slipping about the place, putting a wrapper around one of the most sensitive parts of the body has a nerve deadening and muscle atrophying affect. Would you put mittens on someone trying to learn the piano? Or force a baby to wear gloves when they're trying to pick a tiny pea up off the floor? Of course not. These seem ridiculous. Yet we cover up a child's foot without thinking about it. Isn't that weird? At our house, we don't have a lot of clothing with feet, obviously, but I kept putting the boy in pajamas with feet to keep him warmer. Boo. Off with my head. I mean my feet. His little tootsies are perfectly warm under the covers and we go barefoot in the house, as does he. And plus it's kind of fun to cut up stuff. Aversion to cutting up perfectly good clothing for the sake of a child's brain development is strange. We're a weird breed."", ""So I get a lot of emails after posting some of this and I know you like to read some of my emails that make their way into my inbox. And these are slightly exaggerated but trust me, I get a lot of stuff like this. \xa0Dear Katy, I just read your blog post on letting babies go without socks or covered feet. It's very cold where we live. We live in an igloo actually. There is no floor, just snow and I really want to make sure that my child's feet develop properly. So do you think that he should be barefoot even though, as I said, the floor is below freezing? I would appreciate any help in figuring this one out. And I really love your blog. \xa0Dear Katy, I love your blog. Thanks for writing such helpful information. I just read your post on letting babies go without socks or covered feet and I'm sure what to do at our house, though, and I'm hoping you can help me figure it out. I am a mosaic artist and my husband is a carpenter and we live in a hardware store that has nails instead of regular flooring and in between those nails are huge shards of glass from my pieces and I really want to make sure my child's feet develop properly. So do you think that they should be barefoot even though our house is very dangerous for bare feet? What would you suggest? Thanks again. I know you're very busy. I just can't figure this one out. \xa0"", ""I don't write this sarcastically anymore which does not mean that I don't get these emails still that are actually not that different from this. My point with adding this is I have been deemed an expert. Maybe even by you doing the listening because you're interested in what I say. But you also have common sense. I know you do. And obviously, anything that puts someone at risk greatly needs to be dealt with. At the same time, hopefully, you've been armed through listening or reading with tools that help you categorize things more nuanced than risky or not risky. So anyway. I'm just gonna jump back in to my blog post which just ends with:"", ""I suggest any concerned ones out there: Use your common sense. If your feet can be bare, so can your kids'. Now if I could only figure out what to do with all these pajama feet."", 'So in reading through a lot of my posts, I wore Vibram Five Fingers early on and they were great. There\'s a couple articles where I really explore the effect that going barefoot on very very textured terrain slate for a long long distance. That was the last time I ever experienced menstrual cramping. It was a huge shift for me. \xa0But I haven\'t worn Vibrams since I moved from California where it\'s very dry to the Pacific Northwest where it\'s very wet because that type of shoe doesn\'t work well for me here. I just had a couple of questions saying ""Oh I never see you in Vibrams anymore."" And it really is 1) it\'s too wet here to wear them comfortably, and 2) if it\'s dry enough to be in them, I\'m just happier usually in bare feet. But I\'m on natural terrain quite a bit. So I guess that\'s the overall theme to understand. I don\'t do a ton of cement walking. I always have the option of the grass to the side. I live in a pretty rural area and I\'ve answered on the podcast many times before, if you work all day on cement and 100% of your moving experience is on cement then you have to use that common sense to say, ""ok, I still want flat. I still want a wide toe box. But I\'m going to need a cushion because I am on terrain that is harder"" than kind of that natural relationship between the foot and nature. It\'s just kind of like one monotonous load over and over again. So again that\'s a common sense thing. What I wear now, primarily, is two pairs of sandals; Earthrunners and UnShoes. \xa0Those are the shoes that I\'ve worn - any fair weather. And that can be, you know, as all through fall as well. And I can pair it with a pair of socks. I\'ll just wear their sandals miles and miles and miles. I have a pair of Vivo Barefoot shoes that I wear, as I\'ve noted before in some of my other blog posts on long distance walking. I wear those because they\'re waterproof, they\'re flat, they\'re flexible. When I do long, long distance it\'s usually on the harder, paved trail. So I like the little bit of extra cushion as I just noted. This summer I wore Soft Star Phoenix boots for the snow and my favorite kind of like fall, I want to be warm but it\'s not super super wet, I will wear my Minnetonka Moccasin boots. And for the last 2 years? Three years? I have been able to just treat those - I just make kind of a beeswax water repellent, pair them with really thick wool socks and do a lot of my hiking even in the wet. Even in the snow in those. I\'ll still use my Soft Star boots similarly. The Soft Star boots - they\'re not as fluid for longer distance walking. I find them to be kind of heavier on my foot so I\'ll grab my Minnetonkas. And they will be soaked by the end of a four or five hour excursion. But my feet are warm. It\'s kind of like a wetsuit effect. Where the water has come in and it\'s in my wool sock but everything is warm so I don\'t mind it being wet for that period of time. So that\'s the current state of of the union around here. My kids wear MyMayu. Kind of weather resistant. That\'s their rain boots, but they\'re not a rain boot in the sense of a thick plastic. They\'re just great, superflexible outside. They\'ve worn Soft Stars this fall. And Vivobarefoot has a really great summer shoe. It\'s very porous. It\'s almost like a net or a web and those have been really great for travel and for when it\'s warm enough to be barefoot but they don\'t want to be barefoot. They are free to choose barefoot or shod. And I\'m always surprised how they choose and their choices really have nothing to do with their parents\' choice. They just get whims based on when and where they want to wear shoes. So that\'s how things are going right now. I\'d love to hear about your footwear choices. But I am on social media break.

"", "" She's going to be talking about using your senses differently than maybe you're used to using them. So we talked before about that idea of when you're barefoot, when you're unshod, you pay more attention because you have to. And I'm all very much about movement permaculture, this idea of stacked movement. My husband and I play this game. It might be kind of weird. We go out hiking and we will take turns - there's a couple loops that we hike - and we will take turns hiding from the other one. Like one will run ahead and do the loop so you'll come through and you win if the person walks past you and didn't see you. When I play that game I have to take off my shoes. If I have jackets tied around my waist or hats on my head, even if it's cold, I have to take a lot of that stuff off to really see with more than my eyes. Which I find through doing more and more outside time. And that's not because I'm not going out to hunt or track. I am safer outside when I am aware. But not everything is about safety. \xa0I am more engaged with my surroundings when I am more aware, but sometimes in order to become more aware reflexively, I have to strip off a lot of these protections that I've put on. They are protections in some way and can be sensory deprivation in other ways. So, kind of the things I was talking about a little bit today we will be embodying. Family friendly event. Various ability event. If you want to participate but you're not sure if it will be accessible, please reach out to us. We make as many adjustments to our events as possible.

And while there are plenty of essays in ', 'that encourage you to move, in this episode I\'m gonna focus on I think just a few simple, helpful ways that you can do that. So the first essay is gonna be: ""The Best Piece of Exercise Equipment You\'re Not Using"".\xa0 The second is \xa0""1/2 Dome Triumph"", and the third is ""Kids Not Walking."" If I had to pick a theme it was: Motivation. I think motivation and then, of course, we are at the end of July (I am at the end of July now) and I\'ve just been moving around so much outside that I was just thinking of ways to kind of inspire to think about how they can do that more easily. So I picked these three essays. \xa0', ""Ah, I see I got your attention. \xa0And you are wondering what I could be talking about. The treadmill in your guest bedroom. The one with the clothes on it? \xa0The rollerblades in your closet? The semi-inflated ball in your backyard or the weights you have lying around just in case you're inspired to do a bicep curl? Nope, none of those. \xa0Give up? This one size fits all miraculous tool of amazing design is the floor. That's right ladies and gentlemen. The floor can do wonders for your hips, shoulders, and back tension. It can help you build bone and decrease your blood pressure. But guess what? \xa0You have to get down on it. I know it's an extreme thought. In fact, the hardest three feet you will ever travel is between your hips and the ground. "", ""1) I can get down but I can't get back up. True strength is the ability to manage your body mass in all situations. And if you can't get off the floor then you're lacking the strength and the flexibility required to keep your body healthy. I suggest everyone get down on the floor and up again, every day. Just to make sure you don't lose the ability to. And exercise teachers, have your clients practice the functional task of climbing down to a supine (face up on your back) position, and then back up again."", ""2) My floor is too dirty. \xa0Uh... vacuum it? And this reason seems to be more like a health prohibiting excuse and not a valid reason. When it comes time for your annual doctor visit, how are you gonna feel knowing you could have taken better care of your spine but didn't want to spend 10 minutes cleaning up? "", ""3) There is not enough space. \xa0The smallest space I have ever seen was the quarters of a family of five living on a small sailboat. \xa0They were still able to roll a yoga mat out to create a usable exercise floor, just the perfect size for an adult. If you have a smaller space than that, I want proof, you may have to move things out of the way when it's time to get down. But guess what? \xa0That's exercise too."", ""The biggest thing keeping you from coming down if often your own inertia and seriously even athletes don't like to get down on the ground. It slows them down - as you can imagine. Your body is always trying to conserve energy. It's not that you're lazy. You're just programmed with an internal voice. Panicky internal voice: \xa0Stop doing that. You're using too much energy. There might not be enough food to last us through the winter. Someone really needs to figure out how to explain the recent abundance of kcals to our metabolism. You don't have to feel badly. You just have to have a little mind over matter. That saying is a lot more literal than figurative in this example. \xa0So back to solving the problem of inertia. Step one is to get down on the floor regularly. And even if you didn't do anything else while you were down there, getting up means you've just performed a whole body exercise. Lifting X pounds (just fill in your body weight in the blank). Next time you see someone showing off their chest press with 50-pound weights, you can show them up by doing your impressive full body press. If you want to sweat, start from a standing position and then climb down to the floor ending up face down. Climb back up to a standing position and climb back down ending with you face up. Just repeat the cycle 5 to 10 times. It's more fatiguing than you think. And like I said, those three feet are hard. Many would prefer a challenging workout that doesn't involve the floor. \xa0And P.S., I just made myself do it so, join the club. And I'll add one more thing. This is the primary reason that we don't have furniture in our house. It is not only the sitting, it is the fact that not having furniture, you're still gonna take rests, it just means that you do all these full body, full range presses hundreds of times a day."", ""Ok, second essay. This one I picked because it's a little bit inspiring and I think, too, I like to have a range of voices in my work in general. And then on this show. \xa0So I thought that this kind of spoke to someone who felt like maybe they had aged out of a movement rich lifestyle. So again, I invite everyone to check out "", ' and listen to some ', "" where we've interviewed goldeners and people who have successfully transitioned to more movement really at all ages. \xa0"", 'I get a lot of Katy says email with different questions and emails, etc., but my favorite Dear Katy\'s are those that let me know how alignment is changing your life. And I got a great one today that I wanted to share and I sent a few interview questions to her to help flesh out her story but she was so good she actually wrote it out which saves me time. So thank you, Gail. So those of you who feel like your age or your ailments are limiting you from, well, living, and for those of you who truly believe that you have ""bad knees and backs"", this one is for you. This is reading Gail\'s letter:', 'I have been a big fan of visiting Yosemite for most of my life, but 20 years ago I decided I wanted to climb half-dome. I was 40ish and in relatively good shape. So I started training and two months before the climb I injured my knee doing a stair stepper at the gym. And after 3 years of every type of therapy (and by the way I\'m a chiropractor), I relented and had surgery which had minimal results. So my exercise life was limited to short walks and short recumbent bike rides. After several years I was able to increase my exercise and started doing longer bike rides. And about 3 years ago I developed acute Achilles tendonitis that was so severe I was unable to even walk around my house without pain. Forget any exercise. Back to trying every type of therapy, there is including Apitherapy, bee sting, yuk, no good. Finally, a friend told me I should go to the Restorative Exercise Institute and have an evaluation. \xa0(And Restorative Exercise was the original name of Nutritious Movement - the much larger brand now). Discouraged from all the failed therapy, I put it off for three months but desperation won out and I had an evaluation with Katy. And guess what? I didn\'t believe her when she told me all the things wrong with my posture. In fact, I tried to argue with her. She gave me the look and I said, ""right, I\'ll shut up now."" {And I don\'t know what look I give but evidently, I might have a look}. I was internally rotated with tight psoas, hamstrings, and soleus. But after 1 month of classes I was 90% better and in 3 months I was 98% better and could walk, hike, bike, and anything else I wanted. Wow. When I turned 60 I mentioned to Katy that I had always wanted to climb Half-dome and she said: ""so do it."" After 5 months of training and with the help of all the instructors at Rexi, which was the acronym for the Restorative Exercise Institute. Thank you to all of our teachers out there. After 5 months of training and the help of all the instructors at Rexi, I hiked 17 plus miles up four thousand eight hundred feet and pulled myself up 500 feet of cables. Thanks, Katy. You made it possible and for all of you out there with a dream? Just go to RExI and never give up.

Did I say 25? \xa0I meant 4 and P.S. now it\'s 5. But is there really any difference? Not to me and probably not to her either. Speaking of fun times with kids, have you ever tried to take a fast walk with a 2, 5, and 7 year old? \xa0It turns out you can\'t travel at the pace you originally envisioned. It turns out that walking with little kids is less like walking and more like herding cats. Have you ever tried to get 3-4 cats to do the same thing at once? \xa0Turns out that walking with kids is more difficult than one without kids. You can imagine. I didn\'t have any kids when I wrote this essay. There are many reasons why walking with little ones is challenging but the most basic is they aren\'t at the same level of physical performance as you. They get tired. They get pokey with their little hands and feet. \xa0Then in a team effort, they all manage to start crying at the same time. They also seem to manage to do it when you\'re at the farthest point from the house. It\'s awesome. Turns out exercise isn\'t always a stress reducer. Well, maybe us exercising was relaxing for their mom, who got to stay home and take a nap. So where does the walking child\'s fatigue ""I\'m tired"" come from? After all, we are beings that, at all ages, have always walked for hundreds, thousands of years. Multiple hours a day and with our very survival based on walking endurance. Simply explained, a child\'s fatigue is a result of poor training. Based on my own personal log book of thousands of miles walked, I can say that I have rarely seen a child on a walk beyond returning to the car from a restaurant. I\'ve seen kids held and packed for sure. And I\'ve seen them on skateboards and bikes. And I\'ve also seen kids way too old to be in a stroller being pushed along while the mom is watching her heart rate monitor. So I\'ll just pause there to say, that sounds a bit judgmental and it\'s not with judgment that I say it. It is more with, I would say, a cultural observation that a lot of stuff is set up right now where we know that we need to get our exercise and there\'s not a lot of sharing of responsibility for children. And so we are left with what we are able to figure out how to tend to our needs. And so this is just one of those things. So sorry if anyone\'s ever felt judged by that statement. \xa0This is another aside: I ran into someone at a zoo who came up and introduced herself and then said she felt ashamed that she had a stroller with her at the zoo. And I said, ""You\'re at the zoo with a bunch of kids. You brought your kids to the zoo."" I don\'t want anyone to feel shame for anything I have written. That\'s the opposite. It\'s more like, to go, ""Oh I didn\'t even know that there was something else that might be possible in certain situations."" So that\'s with apologies. Back to the essay.', 'Law of specificity indicates if kids don\'t walk then when they do walk it\'s too hard. \xa0Seems like a pretty simple answer but really this is the basic principle of exercise science. Of course, kids are playing on jungle gyms and participating in sports which is fine. But they aren\'t walking. And don\'t get me wrong, I see teenagers glumly walking around wishing their parents weren\'t so lame, but I\'m really talking about kids aged 2-12 with really rapidly developing bodies. \xa0In the olden days, not like 200 years ago, but let\'s say 20,000 years ago, walking was inherent to our biological culture. From a biomechanical perspective, it is clear that we need to return to walking this kind of distance for the survival of our biology. We can start with a fraction of the distance. And I can\'t say this enough. Doing other exercise does not replace walking. As your physiology depends on the very particular mechanical signals found in regular, well-aligned, locomotion. \xa0So how do you get your kids walking? Step one: Start walking yourself. And I have ""uh-oh"" in the parenthesis. Because I think when we think about how we\'re gonna get other people to do stuff it\'s not always thought of as ""well what am I modeling?"" That someone else needing to do something like logically is going to relate back to you doing it two. Step two: Start walking with your kids. This is gonna go a lot slower than your walk, trust me. But it\'s important to walk as a family at their pace. Discuss that you will be walking because it\'s the most important form of exercise. \xa0Let them plan the route you take. Pick a short distance and make that a habit. i.e. let\'s walk to the store or the creek. So they don\'t feel like the walk will go on indefinitely. Kids love things that seem to go on forever without end. Three: Understand that your kids need to develop the motor programming, strength, and endurance to walk with you. Develop your walking distances accordingly and increase them no more than 10% each week. Four: You probably need to carve out more time for health. If you only have 45 minutes allotted for walking, realize that this is an inadequate time for everyone, you and your kids, to get what you need biologically. So consider placing a planned activity with vitamin DW: Daily walk. The walk is more important than just about anything. Trust me.', 'Which, I mean, you can read about in', "" which is a book that came along, I don't know, seven or eight years after this particular essay because I didn't have kids when I had the perspective of just go get more of the thing. After you have them you realize how much space they occupy in your life. And so it is interesting how your perspective shifts as you diversify your experiences. And I've also gotten to work with a lot of other cultures, now, that don't have the same luxury and privileges that we have, where, oh ok, how does movement fit into our life in a non-exercise format where multiple needs are met. So that's stack your life. Go read the stack your life essay from "", 'to still be able to get more walking but to see how it facilitates other things than just your personal health. \xa0Back to the essay:', ""One more thing about kids and walking; \xa0They don't like walking because it's boring. But guess what? \xa0Parents often think it's boring too which is why music and classes and gyms and special outfits exist. \xa0I once heard if you're bored, you're boring. Which kind of hurts but it's kinda true. There's nothing boring about your body in dynamic motion with its 200 bones and 230 joints and 600 muscles all alive with neurological connection to your brain with each step. Nothing boring about the planet you're walking on and the bugs and the animals and the people you share it with. Develop a daily appreciation for your freedom and ability to walk and then pass it on. Many people come to me as adults in despair wishing that they had one iota of health presented to them as children. In overzealous response, many of us are replacing our lack of natural movement with fitness which can take care of one issue but creates others. Walking with your kids is free. No classes, special camps, or equipment required. No more excuses. Kids need more than playing all day. They need to be able to walk quite a distance. Start your family training today. Their bones and brains will thank you."", 'And it\'s kind of interesting as I\'m recording myself on this podcast. He has always recorded the goings on of the family and I found tapes that he had been making from the 50s all the way to the 90s where he would just put a tape recorder out at dinner or at our family birthday parties. So I have all these archives. I have Katy on tape for a large part of my - not a large volume of my childhood but lots of glimpses of how I was speaking and communicating and acting. And it\'s hilarious. I played one of these the other day with my kids listening. And I noticed that my children were mimicking my style as a child. And it had to do with reading. I read a lot of books aloud on tape. Interestingly enough. \xa0But I had a very, as you can imagine, dramatic, performance, entertaining reading style. Even when I was sitting in my room by myself reading a book to a tape recorder, there was a lot of performance. And so my children are reading and reading aloud as children do. And before it was going through the book to read. And it only took one time of listening to 15 minutes of me reading, where they got all performance-y. And I, Katy Bowman, now, at 42 reading bedtime stories read like that. I mean if you have one of my audiobooks you know this. They had never mimicked the Katy Bowman of 42. But they started mimicking the Katy Bowman age 8. And it kind of opened the idea to this phenomenon I\'ve observed many times before which is: kids learn better from other children, I think, than they learn from adults. I think that there\'s almost a stepwise observance that a 5-year-old looking to a 40-year-old at how to be is not as natural, because there\'s so many steps in between that doesn\'t apply to them, it\'s not as natural, maybe, as a 5-year-old looking at a 6-year-old or an 8-year-old at how to be. There\'s more ability to grasp the skills that sit between 5 and 7 than 5 and 42. So there\'s so much perception, I think, going on of all that there is in terms of behavior. So I\'m very much a fan of multi-age classrooms, playgroups, hikes. You know one of our tricks is to definitely bring someone just a couple of years older - your kids are learning how to swim that they get to spend time with children whose swimming skills are just a tad bit in front of theirs where they\'re - they have this ""oh this is possible, this is a thing. This is not my parents just telling me - or another grown-up - telling me in this class of exactly the same skill set that the next skill set is going to be feasible for me"". So I don\'t know if it\'s scalable modeling or something. There\'s probably a bunch of research on this - this is just my personal observation. This is a long way of saying, I am going to start working on a couple of episodes for children by children because I\'m interested to know that for all of you who are contacting me going ""I want my family, my children, to be more interested or more resilient when it comes to movement and nature."" It might be that they just need models more close to their experience.', ""All right. So I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did making it.

Yeah.""', ""STEPHANIE: Perfect. So we're all doing it. \xa0And if you don't have a half dome you can use a rolled up towel right?"", ""KATY: Yeah. So the Calf Stretch, I always say it's capital C, capital S. It's the name of a very particular exercise structure. It's not just that you're stretching your calf. \xa0Some people can do the Calf Stretch exercise and not actually be stretching their calves. So it's proper noun, proper name. I can be a Bob, but not feel like a Bob, you know. So you just need something, whether it is a half foam roller, which you will often see in the books. It can be a rolled towel. If you are out listening to this when you walk, you can find a rock. You just need something that you step the front of your foot up on while the heel of that same foot stays down on the ground. That's the shape of one leg. And then the other leg steps forward to that other leg that's up on the rock with the toes and down on the ground with the heels."", 'KATY: Yeah. Because not every exercise is gonna move people in the same exact way because an exercise, the effect of an exercise is a relationship between the move and the body you bring to the move. So I call this the Calf Stretch because most people doing it are going to have the range of motion of their ankles, which is heavily influenced by your calves, be challenged by it. But not everyone will. So, you know, as your pool of people that you are working from gets larger and larger than you realize that not everyone is experiencing the same movements because your test group gets larger and larger. Yeah. So for some people they might have, you know like my children who have quite a bit of dorsiflexion, they have a ton of joint ankle range of motion at the ankle where they could be in the exact same shape I was in and not be tensing that tissue at all because they have more of it. \xa0They have more length in that particular area which allows that particular range of motion without a stretch.', 'STEPHANIE: Ok, so do they need to do Calf Stretch?', 'KATY: No.', 'STEPHANIE: Ok. \xa0', ""KATY: No. Because the Calf Stretch is just faking some element of movement that me in front of my computer isn't getting. But they're getting it. So yeah, they don't. Their need to supplement that particular movement or shape is unnecessary just like, you know, you don't need to take a particular vitamin if your diet is rich in it. So no. They would not need this particular move. Were they to continue to get that particular move out in their non-exercise time."", 'STEPHANIE: So in one of your books you write that we should probably stretch our calves for about eleventy hours. \xa0And then maybe stretch them a little more. ', ""KATY: \xa0You mean get calfy for eleventy. Clearly I'm just making up words to fill books..."", 'STEPHANIE: Just hither and yon. \xa0', 'KATY: \xa0Um, you know what? I don\'t necessarily know if it\'s more important than any other move but it is, it\'s extremely impactful. And you know, I\'ve given a gajilliony exercises out there, but the reality is, many people are trying to fit it within a very small period of time allotted to movement. We all have a ton of things that we know our body would really do well if we got them in every day but we\'re trying to pick and choose of those which ones we\'re gonna do so I will often say, and I have said, on film, you can see it; If you\'re only gonna do one, the Calf Stretch, it\'s so impactful because, you know we think ""I\'m gonna stretch my calves, that\'s gonna improve my ankles or my foot, or my knee."" We\'re thinking very local to that area of the calves. \xa0But because of your particular human structure, the fact that our head is above our feet, you know being bi-pedal, when you have a lot of tension in the lower end, closest to the ground ... \xa0When you go to do regular things, just like walk from one side of your house to the other side of the house, that tension can accelerate the upper part of your spine. And so, even if people would come in for \xa0""I\'m not moving very much."" And we\'ll look at which part of them aren\'t moving really well and we\'ll find really stiff immobile shoulders or an upper spine or the back of the neck or even the head. Their face is extremely tight, or they have headaches or headache tension in the back of my neck all of the time, the Calf Stretch will also be part of their must-dos because every step that they are taking because of this stiffness around the lower leg is actually because of the torque of the length of your body being so far off the ground. It\'s moving your upper spine around. So it\'s in every single book because if you were only going to do one it has the potential to influence the most of you in a way that most of us are moving every day. Which is, you know, taking a few steps here or there just to accomplish the non-exercise things in our life. So it\'s just very impactful. It\'s gonna impact everything from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and so I don\'t know if there\'s another single exercise that moves that much of you differently after you\'re done doing the exercise.', ""STEPHANIE: It's incredible to think that stretching my calves could alleviate a headache."", ""KATY: \xa0I've had people come who had some ...you know, \xa0headaches was a very regular reality and they're doing a ton of neck and shoulder stuff which makes sense. And if you're doing those keep those, that's great. But the thing is, it's like the tensions that are in the back of your neck are kind of like a compensation for the accelerations that you're doing to your head and neck because of the state of your lower legs. "", ""We're very familiar with a whiplash injury where your head goes accelerating forward one way but is yanked back another way. \xa0In the opposite direction. There's like this (whip noise), I hope the sound effect should help you visually, you know that you're creating, you're moving very quickly between two directions. Now, most of our understanding of whiplash comes on the scale of being rear-ended or something that's happening at 30 or 40 miles per hour ..."", 'STEPHANIE: \xa0Right.', ""KATY: ...but the mechanics are the same even if you're walking 3 miles an hour and the whiplash, that accelerating forward real quickly but then bracing it and pulling it back so it doesn't go, I explain it like, you're essentially having whiplash at a very slow rate, at 3 miles an hour, but you're doing it hundreds, if not ten thousand times a day."", 'STEPHANIE: Right.', 'KATY; So I mean, it\'ll often be active people, ""I\'m getting my 10,000 steps in but oh my upper back and my neck are killing me."" \xa0And I\'m like, yeah we\'re gonna change the mechanics of your walk a little bit by doing this move here a little bit and you\'ll find that now you can walk in a way that isn\'t creating such extra motion at the neck and the need for you tense to withstand it. So you can keep stretching your neck or you can stop doing something that is creating the reason you are tensing your neck. So yeah.', 'STEPHANIE: Yeah.', ""KATY: Headache people listen up.

There's a strong connection there, literally and figuratively. What I'm getting more of as I stretch my calves is an increased, hopefully, range of motion in my ankles. Is that right?"", 'KATY: ', 'STEPHANIE: Mm-hmm. Right.', ""KATY: Where at the end of the day the whole reason you were after ... and so, and continue on with the same movement habits in which you developed that particular length.

There\'s a lot of ways...well I don\'t know if there\'s a lot... but there are movement free ways of getting those. But it turns out the only payoff really of lots of ankle range of motion is that it affords to use more muscle of you when you\'re moving. Like the when you\'re moving is when the ranges of motion pay off. And then other people who will do the Calf Stretch and not feel a stretch, they can have, you know, not everyone is dealing with tension. Some people are dealing with the need for stability. So they\'re like, ""I\'ve got tons of ranges of motion."" And they\'re particular ranges of motion, when they go to move, kind of remove some of the natural or helpful breaking, like, um... to apply the brakes.

So it's kind of like we're after move movement at the end of the day.

But he wears cowboy boots all the time. And I put a picture of this on "", "". The way I explain it to him is like, he's also an airline pilot now. So it's a tremendous amount of sitting and when he is sitting he's in boots, heeled boots - a couple inches. SO the way I explain a Calf Stretch to him is, you haven't been getting very much uphill walking. Right? And uphill walking is part of a nutritious diet. And I don't even have to put it in terms of nutrients for him. He knows he's happier, his body feels better, when he's hiking. He knows all those things."", 'STEPHANIE: Right.', 'KATY: They\'re not related to a scientific context or a movement science context. That\'s not part of his culture. So I don\'t speak in a culture that doesn\'t make sense to him. Nor do I feel like my culture has to make sense to him for him to benefit from the Calf Stretch. So I\'ll just say, ""you have spent so much time downhill in those boots that a lot of what you\'re feeling is the same if you had just walked downhill...', 'STEPHANIE: Mmm.', 'KATY: ... for seven.. for eleventy miles, because you have."" \xa0Because he puts those shoes on as soon as he gets up and he takes them off at the end of the day. So I said, ""Why don\'t you supplement or balance with a little bit of vitamin uphill - to balance it out."" That\'s how I give my brother the Calf Stretch. And he does it. Because it makes sense to him that he\'s gone for long hikes and he knows he feels like crap after going downhill for 8 hours.', 'STEPHANIE: Right.', ""KATY: Because he's had to. \xa0So that context makes sense to him and he'll throw in a little bit. He'll do the Calf Stretch. He's not thinking of range of motion or any of these like exercise-y things. He just knows that it's a movement that makes him feel better but he doesn't know how to get it in his current life situation which is drive to sit in a plane to fly, inside a sedentary context. But you know the Calf Stretch is a little bit of vitamin uphill."", 'STEPHANIE: I have to say my calves feel better already. And so does the rest of me.', ""KATY: What is this? \xa020 minutes. What's eleventy minus 20?"", ""STEPHANIE: 20 minutes. It wasn't even eleventy anything."", 'KATY: ', 'When I do the Calf Stretch I swear I am toggling something that is pulling on my brain.', 'STEPHANIE: Mmm.', ""KATY: And so I do it almost to reset. Because I'm still stepping around. I'm still doing things. But it just, I don't know, it's whole body for me. Like the Calf Stretch, yes, it's dorsiflexion. But my whole body is participating in doing it. So it is very much my reset button."", ""STEPHANIE: It's the source of all your power, Katy Bowman."", ""KATY: That's how you know the answer? \xa0Is Calf Stretch. \xa0You wanna ask me a question? \xa0It's Calf Stretch."", ""STEPHANIE: You know that's gonna make the rest of our podcast conversations real short."", 'KATY: Calf stretch. Did you ever watch Cutting Edge? The movie about the ice skater and the hockey player and their unconventional romance.', 'STEPHANIE: Yes.', 'KATY: You know, whenever she said, ""toe-pick"" all the time, she\'d be like sliding by every time he fell and she\'d just be like, ""toe-pick"". I\'m just gonna be like, ""Calf stretch.""', 'STEPHANIE: I love it.', 'KATY: Calf stretch. \xa0Popping in there giving you expert advice.', 'STEPHANIE: \xa0hashtag.', 'KATY: (whispers) Hashtag #calfstretch', 'STEPHANIE: #calfstretch. \xa0Katy thanks for this.', ""KATY: Yes.
