Feel free to point them out, but please be nice!', 'In early\nwinter of 1822, Captain Samuel Barrett Edes became a hero. He was sailing in\nthe south-east Pacific when he and his crew encountered a Dutch ship that was\nin trouble. Edes managed to save every single one of the Dutch soldiers, and\nthen headed for the city of Batavia, known today as Jakarta, to drop them off\nand see if a reward could be collected. While he waited, he did some shopping.\nNow, Edes wasn’t rich by any stretch of the imagination, but he owned a small\nportion of the ship he sailed and of course, he was expecting a handsome reward\nfor his heroic efforts. With this in mind, he kept an eye open for something\nunusual and conversation-worthy to take home, and that’s when he saw it. ', ' was a mummified mermaid. It was over\ntwo feet long, had the curved tail one might find on a fish, but the upper body\nof something much more human in shape. It was brown from the preservation\nprocess, wrinkled with age and entirely addictive to look at, and Captain Edes\nknew instantly that he had to own it. In late January of 1822, he did something\nbold. He sold the ship he did not fully own and used the proceeds to buy the\nmermaid. Then he found transportation back to London and put the odd creature\non display, because just about everyone who saw it believed that it was real. ', 'Of course,\nthere were those who could see through the hoax. Captain Edes had been fooled\nby a clever craftsman who had sewn the torso of an orangutan onto the lower\nhalf of a large salmon. Elements were added to the face and hands to give it a\nmore humanlike appearance, but those with training in natural science and anatomy\ncould spot the hidden clues that gave it all away. That didn’t matter to most\npeople, though. The idea that mermaids could be real had been around for\ncenturies, so when something as powerful as a mummified specimen floated into\ntheir world, they were blind to its flaws and impossibility. They wanted to believe,\ndeep down inside, that the hybrids of folklore actually existed. Today, we know\na lot more about our world than we used to, but if we were to go back in time\nand live through a less learned age, we would be amazed at the stories that\nawait us, tales of creatures that sit at the very edge of our imagination,\nliving things that defy logic, and monsters that inspire wonder. Our hearts\nwant to believe while our minds are ready to move on. Instead, what we tend to\nfeel is a mixture of deep curiosity and primal fear, and if the tales from the\npast are any indication, there’s a good reason why. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this\nis ', '. ', 'When we\ntalk about the natural world, the very first thing we need to do is gain some\nperspective. Today, we live in a technologically rich society. We carry\nsupercomputers in our pockets that are more powerful than the ones that sent\nthe first humans to the moon. We can walk past an intriguing part of our\nneighbourhood, pull out our phones and look at a satellite map or do a search\nfor more information. We’re still hungry people, curious and drawn to unanswered\nquestions, but rather than starving in a house with little food, we feast each\nday on a never-ending buffet of answers and information. Today, if you want to\nknow something, chances are good you can learn about it in an instant, but\nhundreds of years ago, that was an impossibility. Not that people didn’t try,\nthough. 2000 years ago, a Roman named Gaius Plinius Secundus attempted to\ngather everything knowable into one place, and he did an admirable job considering\nthe world he lived in. Gaius was born into a wealthy Roman family in the year 24AD\nand followed a path of privilege all the way to the top. He was well educated,\nwell connected, and when he entered the Roman military, he quickly rose to the\nsecond highest level possible – the equestrian order. Once out of the military,\nhe served as a lawyer, before being assigned various governorships around the\nempire, and towards the end of his life, he had the privilege to serve as\nadvisor to two different emperors. Today, we know him as Pliny the Elder, but\nin his day, Gaius was a success story. ', 'Looking\nback, his biggest legacy was his 37 volume collection of knowledge called ', '. It was possibly the\nworld’s first encyclopaedia, gathering everything known about a whole array of\nsubjects, from farming and botany to geography and anthropology, but the most\ninfluential contribution, filling up volumes seven through 11, were his\nwritings on zoology, the study of all living creatures. But here’s the thing –\nPliny the Elder, like everyone else in his society, lacked the proper tools to\ndig deep and apply hard science to every creature he wrote about. He also\nlacked the ability to travel and see each animal he described, so he relied\nheavily on others, like Aristotle’s ', ' and the writings of Eratosthenes and Hipparchus, and that meant his\ncollection was less than perfect. How so? Well, his work on zoology included\nsuch amazing animals as dragons, mermen, and even something called a ', ', a race of hairy, human-like\nbeings who literally had no head on their shoulders, with eyes and a mouth\nright in the middle of their chest. Pliny was thorough, for sure, but not very\ndiscerning with his source material. ', 'But what\nhis work did do was give birth to something a lot of people have heard of, a type\nof book known as a bestiary. It took a while for their availability to spread,\nbut by the early middle ages, bestiaries were a common enough resource. They\nwere, at the basic level, books about known animals, typically with colourful\ndrawings to help the reader visualise the specific details of each entry, and\nover the centuries, some editions became more popular than others. One of the\nmost famous is the Aberdeen Bestiary, an illuminated manuscript that dates back\nto the 12', ' century. Aside from being a beautiful example of\nmedieval artwork – and I mean that, you should seriously do an internet search\nfor sample pages – the Aberdeen Bestiary is also a powerful example of just how\npopular these books really were. It’s filled with images of all sorts of animals,\nalong with rocks, fish, trees and even worms, and a lot of the entries in the\nmanuscript include notes about the nature of the thing in question, making it a\nvaluable reference tool for any budding naturalist. But these bestiaries did more\nthan that – they inspired the popular culture of their day. ', 'England’s\nKing John, who reigned from 1177 to 1216 was said to have a copy of Pliny the\nElder’s ', ' in his personal\ncollection, and John’s son and successor, King Henry III, even used images from\nit to decorate one of the chambers at Westminster. As their popularity spread,\nmore and more writers got in on the tradition. The Norman poet Philip de Thaun wrote\na bestiary about a generation after William the Conqueror invaded England, and\nit became a gift for King Henry II’s wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Even Leonardo\nda Vinci made one. It seems if you were an intelligent person in the middle\nages or the Renaissance, making your own bestiary was practically a rite of\npassage – and let’s be honest, colourful manuscripts filled with unbelievable creatures\nand animals that defied logic couldn’t not be popular. Humans have this innate\ndesire to look at curious things. We’ve always been rubberneckers, straining to\ntake a long, hard look at things that sit outside our normal experience, and\nthe spread of bestiaries is proof of that. But those ancient books and manuscripts\nalso teach us something else about ourselves. Human beings are creative\ncreatures. When faced with a mysterious gap in our knowledge, we’re more likely\nto invent something to plug the hole than to leave the question unanswered – and\nwhat we’ve come up with is equal parts entertaining and downright terrifying.', 'I\nmentioned earlier how the internet and the accessibility of powerful devices has\ngiven us an edge over our predecessors, and in a lot of ways that’s true. Yes,\nwe have access to a huge majority of our collective knowledge, but not all of\nit. In fact, there are still things we don’t know. For example, scientists\ntoday believe that there are roughly 8.7 million animal species on this planet,\nand yet 86% of the ones that would live on land still haven’t been discovered\nor studied, and it’s even worse inside our oceans, where over 90% of life is\nstill a mystery to us. We know a lot, yes, but our world is massive and diverse,\nand that makes the learning process slow and tedious. Some animals are also a\nbit harder to track down, they’re less abundant or more shy, and so it’s made\nstudying them more of a challenge. A good example is the platypus. For a very\nlong time, scientists thought the descriptions of it were nothing more than a\nhoax. I mean, it was rumoured in 1799 to be a hybrid of a duck and a water rat,\npart mammal and part bird, with venomous spurs that could kill a dog, and while\nwe’ve learnt more about them over the years, the platypus is still an allusive\ncreature. A recent documentarian was able to get what he considered to be a\ngoldmine of actual footage of the animal, amounting to about 30 seconds, and\nwhen only half a minute of film is something to celebrate, you know the animal\nis hard to study. ', 'Of course,\nwhile we’re searching for new species, the ones we do know about are slowly\ndying off, which doesn’t help. Some estimates place the number of species on\nthe edge of extinction at around 20,000, and more get added to that list all\nthe time. For the medieval writers of bestiaries, this would be their worst\nnightmare. All those creatures belong in their books, and yet they keep slipping\naway. But at the same time, not being able to see an animal never really\nstopped those ancient writers from including it in their catalogue of life on\nearth. In fact, there are a lot of entries that would cause most people to\nscratch their heads, because while, yes, we’ve grown in our understanding of\nthe world around us, these bestiaries serve as a time capsule of our gullibility.\nAs far back as Pliny the Elder’s collection on natural history, we can see\nthose less believable creatures pop up. He once wrote that thousands of sea-nymphs\nknown as ', ' had washed up on the\nshores of what is modern day France, and that they looked just like the nymphs\nof the land, except that they were covered in fish scales. He also wrote about\nthat fiery bird of legend known as the phoenix, which was known to burst into\nflames before re-emerging from its own ashes. And of course, I’ve already\nmentioned his fascination with mermen and ', '.\nIt seems that Pliny the Elder had an obsession with gathering all known\ncreatures, whether or not he had witnessed them with his own eyes. ', 'Other historians\nadded their own contributions to those mystical lists as well, and if I ran\nthrough it for you now, it would sound like a recap of the ', 'series. Hippos and elephants shared the same space as\nhippogriffs and mandrakes. There were dragons and tritons, giants and sea\nmonsters. Honestly, it sometimes seemed that if a young child could draw a\npicture of it, that was good enough to get it included. Of course, some\ncreatures were more popular than others, and that popularity varied from\nculture to culture. In Europe, one of the most talked about creatures of all\nwas also one of the smallest, but don’t let its size fool you, because there\nwas nothing safe about the basilisk. Our old friend, Pliny the Elder, wrote about\nit 2000 years ago, describing it as a serpent with legs that was no larger than\na foot in length. But what it lacked in size, it more than made up for with\nattitude and special features. A basilisk was said to stand tall on its back\nlegs and had a crown-like plume on top of its head. And they were dangerous,\ntoo – according to the stories, basilisks were so poisonous that even looking\nat them could get you killed. Other creatures avoided the like the plague, and\nwherever they chose to make their nests, the plant life would die and wither\naway. One description I read said that if a man on horseback stabbed the\nbasilisk with a spear, the poison was so powerful that it could climb up the\nspear, kill the man, and then kill the horse as well. ', 'Of course,\nwhen something is that powerful and deadly, it eventually becomes the centrepiece\nof tales of valour. It’s said that Alexander the Great once killed a basilisk,\nand like many of the other legends about him, he did it in a way that proved\nnot just his might but also his intelligence. It’s said that he polished his\nshield until it was like a mirror, and then approached the creature holding it\noutward. When the basilisk saw its own reflection, it fell victim to its\npoisonous gaze and instantly dropped dead. We can find images of the basilisk\nin just about every bestiary in existence, most of which look like a cross\nbetween a snake and a rooster. There’s a statue of one in Vienna, commemorating\nan 11', ' century hunt, and there’s even a church in Sweden with a\ncarved relief showing St. Michael stabbing one with a spear. So popular was\nthis creature that people sold powders that they claimed to be ground-up\nbasilisk, something that most people purchased for use in alchemy, but more\nthan a few used as an antidote to poison. Everywhere you look through the\nmiddle ages and earlier, the basilisk is waiting to rear its poisonous little\nhead. You can see society’s attraction to it in their folklore and superstition,\na mixture of fear and fascination, of wonder and disgust. For centuries, it\npopped up in stories whispered all around Europe, like a well-loved character\nin a popular book series. But if one account is any indication, it might not be\na work of fiction after all. ', 'The people\nof Warsaw had a problem on their hands. They were two decades into a new\npolitical structure known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and while it gave\na lot of freedom to the wealthy and elite, it left the lower class in a\nconstant state of fear and oppression. Life in the city was challenging for\nmany people, but that was the new normal. In 1587, though, something happened\nto put the people of Warsaw on edge. Livestock in the area around an old,\nruined building had begun to turn up dead. Even a few of the neighbouring\nresidents had been found poisoned in their beds, washing over the community\nwith a wave of grief and loss. And in the midst of all that confusion and pain,\ntwo of the neighbourhood children disappeared. Well, disappeared might not be\nthe right word for it. Folks had seen the two young girls playing near the\nruins, they had watched them laugh and skip and revel in the freedom and joy\nthat came with childhood, most likely muttering quiet prayers that it would\nlast as long as possible. The neighbours knew what sort of hard life awaited\nthose girls once they were old enough to work and carry their own weight. Their\njoy must have been bittersweet. ', 'And then\nsomeone watched them step inside the ruins. That was the first reason to worry.\nFolks avoided the ruins for a good reason – it was dark and dangerous, and the\ncellar beneath it had been a den for all sorts of animals. So, whoever it was\nthat watched them disappear into the shadows most likely headed over to warn\nthe girls’ parents. When everyone arrived at the ruins to call them out, though,\nthey were no longer visible. While there was a good chance they had simply\nmoved on to a new playground, someone decided to peer inside the dark cellar,\nand there, laying on the broken stone floor, were the sleeping forms of both\ngirls. So, one of the older women stepped inside to wake them. A moment later,\nthough, she collapsed into a heap beside the girls, sending the growing crowd into\na panic. They didn’t know what was causing the people inside the cellar to lose\nconsciousness, but they knew there was something dangerous about the dark\nspace, so they sent for a fire hook – a long pole with a metal hook on the end –\nand then reached in and pulled each body out into the light. All three of them\nwere dead, and not just dead – they were bloated and dark, as if they’d been\ndead for days. Most frightening of all, though, was that their eyes seemed to\nbe protruding from their sockets. No one could be sure, but it almost looked as\nif they’d been frightened to death. ', 'Wanting\nanswers, they sent for Benedictus, the king’s very own physician. If anyone\nwould have the skill to identify the danger, it would be him. And, sure enough,\nafter taking a long look at the trio of bodies, he brought them a definitive\nanswer. All of them had been killed by a basilisk. In an instant, the\natmosphere around the old ruins changed. Newcomers came to watch, while leaders\ngathered to form a plan. Something had to be done, and just like the stories\nall of them had grown up with, it seemed that a basilisk hunt was in order, but\nthe trouble was no one wanted to risk their lives by entering the cellar to kill\nit – not even Benedictus, who seemed to know the most about the creature. But\nthey had an idea. A group of leaders from the community quickly headed to the\nlocal jail, where two men awaited execution for various capital crimes. Each man\nwas given the same offer: come kill the basilisk, and you will receive a full\npardon and your freedom as a reward. It seemed like an easy choice, too –\ninside jail, there was no chance of survival. Outside, though, there was at\nleast the possibility they might survive. It made sense to everyone.', 'The first\ncriminal declined the offer, but the other one, a man named Johann Faurer,\nagreed to help. He was escorted from the jail to the old ruins, where\nBenedictus awaited him with tools and instructions. The townsfolk had quickly\ngathered dozens of small mirrors and sewn them onto a pair of leather pants and\na coat. I imagine Johann gave the old physician a sideways glance at the sheer\nridiculousness of it all, but at the same time, he would have known the\nfolklore just as well as everyone else. Alexander the Great had defeated a\nbasilisk using a mirror-like shield, so why would it not work for him? With a\ncrowd of over 2000 witnesses watching, Johann began to carefully walk into the\nruins, where he entered the cellar. He had a long rake in one hand and a torch\nin the other, to light his way, and as soon as he stepped into the darkness\nbelow, he cried out that he could see it – a long, serpent-like tail, with a\nhead that resembled that of a rooster, right down to the crown-like plumage.\nBenedictus called out instructions to the man. “Grab it with the rake,” he told\nhim, “and then carry it out here into the light.” Johann shouted back that he\nunderstood, and the entire crowd began to shift and rumble. If a basilisk was\ngoing to be dragged out of the ruins, no one wanted to be around to see it, so\nthey all ran for cover and hid their eyes. When Johann emerged, he held the writhing\ncreature by the neck in one of his gloved hands. They daylight somehow made it\nweaker, and that gave Benedictus the courage to step closer and examine it. It\nlooked exactly like the bestiaries of old had taught him – the body of a snake,\nfour long legs and a head that looks very much like a rooster. ', 'But sadly,\nthis is where the account of the basilisk hunt ends. Whoever had been recording\nthe events had most likely been in the crowd, and when Johann had begun to\nemerge from the cellar, they had followed the crowd into hiding, which leaves\nthe ending a bit of a mystery. Who killed the creature, when all was said and\ndone, and how did they do it, knowing the risks the old legends spoke of? What\nwe do know is this: the Warsaw basilisk hunt of 1587 was the last time the\ncreature was reported anywhere in Europe. Maybe it had been the last of its kind,\nand its death marked its extinction, or perhaps the few that survived had a knack\nfor staying out of sight – like the platypus of Australia. Either way, all that\nwas left from that moment on were legends and stories. Like so many creatures\nthat have once walked the earth, the basilisk – if it was ever real to begin\nwith – has slipped into the shadows of the past, and it’s never been seen\nagain. ', 'There\nreally is something delightful about the bestiaries of old. Their colourful\npages and evocative descriptions were beyond sensational. In a world without\ntelevision, radio or easily accessible works of fiction, those catalogues of\nnatural history were the closest most people could get to travelling the world.\nOf course, the things most authors chose to include in their bestiaries would probably\nnever make the cut in our modern times. After all, headless tribesmen with eyes\non their chests, unicorns and sea nymphs all feel more like characters in a\nfantasy novel than entries in a study on the world’s flora and fauna. And yet\nsome of those expectations have been broken over the years. For centuries,\nsailors told stories about the kraken, enormous sea creatures that could reach\nout and drag an entire ship underwater with its long tentacles. King Sverre of\nNorway recorded its description way back in 1180, and for hundreds of years\npeople claimed to spot them in the waters of the ocean. Then, in 1853, the\ncarcass of a giant squid washed up on a Danish beach, giving the legend new\nlife. Over the century and a half since then, scientists have determined that\nthere is indeed a giant sea creature that fits the ancient descriptions – give or\ntake a few sinking ships, of course – and while they’ve been challenging to\ncatch on film, we now know they exist. And those mermaids of old might have\nroots in actual animals as well. Many scientists and scholars now believe that\nold reports of mermaids could very well be mistaken sightings of an aquatic mammal\nknown as the manatee. As is so often the case, our misunderstandings had given\nbirth to frightening legends, only to have science bring a bit of clarity to the\ntale. Sometimes the monsters of the ancient world turn out to be real, and\nsometimes legends inspire new discoveries. ', 'In the\npart of the world that stretches from Mexico to South America, scientists have\nbeen familiar for over a century with a lizard from the iguana family. It’s not\nthe largest reptile around, but it can grow to around 2ft in length, and it can\nrun at amazing speeds. Some scientists refer to it as the Jesus Christ Lizard\nbecause of its strange ability to run across the surface of water. But its most\ncommon name is based on other features, like its tendency to run on two legs\nand its serpent-like body – a body that’s topped with a head and plumes reminiscent\nof a crown or a rooster, which is why its name is both logical and a bit of a\nthrowback. They call it the basilisk. ', 'There’s\nsomething enticing about the mysteries that fill the gaps in our knowledge of\nthe world around us. Looking back at the bestiaries of the middle ages, its clear\nhumans have had a lot of fun filling those holes, and the creativity of the\npast has continued to inspire stories today. But there’s one more creature I\nwant to tell you about. Stick around after this brief sponsor break to learn\nall about it. ', '[Sponsor\nbreak from Bombas, Casper and Fracture]', 'They had\nfallen in love, and it was something that would change their destiny forever.\nAt least, that’s how the legend tells it. Long ago, a young man lived on a\nsmall island surrounded by deep blue seas, and in the process of hunting one\nday, he encountered a beautiful young woman. But the hunter quickly learned\nthat there was more to her than he could see with his eyes. The woman, it turns\nout, was a fairy. In fact, she was well known to the locals there, who referred\nto her as the Dragon Princess. Despite their differences – him, a normal human\nbeing, and her, a magical fairy – the two of them fell in love and were soon\nmarried, and that helps this tale become on of those happily ever after stories\nthat we all love so much. The couple went on to have twins, a boy and a girl,\nand just like their parents, they were an odd pair. The boy was just like his\nfather, a human with no magical powers of his own, while the girl took after\nher mother, and because of that, both parents decided that the children should\nbe raised in separate places to help them fully become who they were meant to\nbe. ', 'According to\nthe legend, it was many years later when the son was out hunting, just as his\nfather had taught him. He was creeping through the forest, his spear balanced\nin one hand, when he spotted a deer. He quickly threw the weapon, which found\nits target, and a heartbeat later the young man was carefully making his way\nover to collect his prize, and that’s when the dragon stepped out of the trees.\nIt was enormous and frightening, and it clearly wanted to take the deer that he\nhad just killed. The young hunter spoke to it, begging it to leave his future\nmeal alone, but the creature ignored him and proceeded to move toward the deer,\nso he lifted another spear and got ready to take aim at the dragon. Suddenly, a\nfigure stepped out of the shadows of the forest and stopped him. It was his\nmother, the fairy princess, who he had not seen since his childhood, and as she\napproached him, she spoke a word of warning. “Do not throw that spear”, she told\nhim, “for that is no ordinary dragon. That is your sister.” Instead, she taught\nhim to live in harmony with his sister, and according to the legend, that fateful\nmeeting set the destiny of their entire community on a new path. Even today, if\nyou were to visit the place where they lived, the people there would tell you\nthat they are descended from dragons, illustrating how that harmony has\ncontinued. ', 'And of\ncourse, this story is just one of many tales about dragons that fill the pages\nof folklore. In fact, most of us would be hard pressed to find a creature\nmentioned more often than those magical beasts, from the 11', '\ncentury legend of King George and the Dragon to the fantasy novels and television\nshows of our modern world. They really do seem to be the king of monsters.\nDragons are also one of those nearly universal creatures. It seems just about\nevery culture around the world has had some version of them in their folklore.\nThe ancient Egyptian god of chaos was Apophis, represented as a giant serpent.\nThe Babylonians had their own god of chaos called Tiemat, and in Arcadian\nmythology there were not one but three dragons on display. Norse mythology\nfeatures a giant serpent who gnaws at the roots of the world tree. In Ukrainian\nfolklore, there is a dragon with three heads, while images of dragons can be\nfound all over medieval heraldry. And of course, few cultures on earth hold as\ntightly to their dragon mythology as the Chinese, who have been decorating\nobjects with images of the creature at least as far back as the Neolithic period,\nand we could speculate why, I’m sure. It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to\nsee how the accidental discovery of dinosaur bones might spark fear and wonder\nin the minds of humans thousands of years ago. The places where stories of\ndragons are most common are also places where such fossils have been uncovered,\nso it does make sense. ', 'So, when\nEuropeans arrived on an island in the Flores Sea, just south of Indonesia, they\nprobably didn’t think twice about the local stories about dragons. In fact, those\ntales were probably a bit old hat, as they say. Dragons lived in caves, breathed\nfire, were vicious killers and could fly when necessary – nothing about all of\nthat was new. What was new, though, were the things they saw there. On an island\nsurrounded by deep, blue sea, an island full of people who believed they were\ndescended from dragons, mind you, they discovered a creature that brought all\nof their legends to life. It lived in the caves along the shore, it was an\nenormous killer, and it sometimes even followed its prey up into the trees. It\nticked all the boxes. These were 300lb serpent-like monsters that could bring\ndown a half-tonne water buffalo. When they licked the air with their bright red\ntongue, it looked as if they were spitting fire, and they even dug into the graves\nof the dead looking for treasure. Of course, that treasure was always food, not\ngold. And they’re still there, crawling across the sandy beaches of the island,\nliving in harmony, more or less, with the people who still call the place their\nhome. They might not have wings or piles of golden treasure to curl up on, but\nthey are the largest lizard on earth, measuring in at over 10ft in length, and\nthey’re deadly. Sometimes the tales of the past stay shrouded in mystery, and\nother times we manage to crack the riddle and shed new light on the shadows\nthat once frightened us. This living, flesh and blood dragon seems to offer a\nfresh answer to an ancient question, however incomplete it might be, but at\nleast we now know that there really is one place in the world where that old\ncartographer warning is actually true: Here, on Komodo Island at least, there\nbe dragons.

Whatever it was, the villagers claimed that it would\nenter their homes, eat their food, break their dishes and then move on to\nrepeat itself elsewhere. They named this creature “Andilaveris”', 'and they claimed it was a ', ', a close cousin to the\ntraditional European vampire. Andilaveris drank their wine and smashed their\nbelongings, howling like a wolf and making a loud, horrible mess, but the most\ninteresting feature of this story is that no one actually saw Andilaveris do\nthese things. The villagers claimed to witness it all, of course, but they said\nhe was invisible; he was, in essence, a noisy spirit, but the only cultural\nlens they were able to view him through was as a vampire. And they weren’t the\nfirst: between 1591 and 1923, people across Europe told similar stories – an\ninvisible monster that raided their homes and destroyed their belongings. Today,\nwe see events like these play out across the screens of our local move theatre.\nHollywood has been fascinated with invisible, violent forces since the early\n1980s, when they brought us ', '.\nWhat once was looked on as overly spiritual and easily disproven is now\nattracting the attention of popular culture, but poltergeists have a history\nthat runs far deeper than just the 1980s. From first century Roman accounts to\nmodern newspapers, stories of humans interacting with angry ghosts have been\ntold for a very, very long time. Some are clearly hoaxes; some are\nmisinterpretations of natural events; oftentimes they are a grab for attention\nor a cry for help; but sometimes, on very rare occasions, a story comes along\nthat is nothing short of haunting. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '. ', 'The word\n“poltergeist” evokes a number of ideas for most people. Most think about the\nmovie. Some picture objects being thrown around a room by invisible hands. You\nmight even envision the sound of chains, or doors creaking open in the night.\nAnd they wouldn’t be too far from the truth – the word “poltergeist” is German,\nand it literally means “noisy spirit”. The idea is that, while the typical\nghost story only uses one of our five senses, our sight, stories of poltergeists\ncan often tap all five. Most poltergeist accounts reference the same types of\nactivity: objects that are mysteriously moved or broken; noises in and around\nthe house; physical attacks such as biting, pinching, hitting, and even\ntripping. Some people even claim to have seen objects, or other people,\nlevitated by an unseen force, and unlike some folklore, stories of noisy\nspirits are nearly universal. Similar manifestations have been reported by\nwitnesses in dozens of cultures for centuries, from Japan and Brazil to Australia\nand the United States. To those who view widespread distribution as a major\nsign of proof, poltergeists have become an indisputable fact. One of the\nearliest records of a poltergeist encounter actually comes from the 1', '\ncentury Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus. He recorded an exorcism in 94AD\nthat sounds eerily similar to those of us familiar with modern exorcism tales.\nIn his report, he describes how, as the spirit was being driven from the\nperson, a bowl of water all the way across the room was suddenly overturned by\nan invisible hand. Jacob Grimm, half of the famous Grimm brothers who recorded\nmany of the stories we remember from our childhood, also wrote more scholarly books.\nIn his book ', 'Grimm\nrecorded a story from the German town of Bingen am Rhine that took place in the\n4', ' century. According to the story, people were pulled out of their\nbeds by an unseen force; loud noises could be heard, as if someone were\nknocking on the walls or floor; stones were even thrown, but the person – or spirit\n– who did the throwing was never found. Gerald of Wales, the famous clergyman\nand chronicler, wrote in 1191 of a house in Pembrokeshire that was filled with\npoltergeist activity. Here, the unseen spirit was said to have thrown handfuls\nof dirt as well as tearing clothing and breaking objects in the house. Most\nfrightening to those who experienced it, though, was the fact that this spirit\nwas also said to vocalise all the secrets of the people in the room. ', 'Similar\nstories have been recorded countless times in the centuries since Gerald’s day.\nIn one story from the early 1700s, one family encountered unusual activity in\nthe church rectory, in Epworth, Lincolnshire. Reverend Samuel Wesley and his\nwife, Susanna, had 10 children and had lived in the house since it had been\nbuilt, shortly after the previous rectory burnt to the ground in 1709. During\nthe winter of 1716 to 1717, the family began to experience regular noises. They\nwould hear knocking on the walls and doors, or the sounds of people running up\nand down the stairs. The house was searched from top to bottom, hoping to find\nthe person responsible, but no cause was found. They even named the noisy\nspirit “Old Jeffrey”, and it was said that the spirit made himself visible on\nChristmas day that winter. Shortly after, the noises stopped, never to happen\nagain. In more modern times, one well-known story is that of the Black Monk of\nPontefract. There, in the growing community just outside the city of Wakefield\nin West Yorkshire, England, reports began to circulate about the most violent\npoltergeist in European history. Joe and Jean Pritchard lived at 30 East Drive\nin 1970 along with their son, Phillip, and daughter, Diane. According to their\nreport, they were plagued by problems in the house from the start: objects were\nthrown, the temperature in rooms would suddenly drop, and they would even find\npuddles on the floor. They named the spirit Fred, and soon learnt that Fred was\nnot just mischievous, but also violent. Not only did the spirit throw eggs and\ntake bites out of their sandwiches, but it also dragged their 12-year-old\ndaughter, Diane, up the stairs by her neck, leaving handprints on her skin.\nAfter Fred attempted to strangle Diane a second time, this time with an electrical\ncord, the family asked for help. The police were brought in, as were a number\nof psychics and paranormal researchers. Even the mayor came by for a visit, but\nnothing seemed to help. Eventually, the Pritchard’s moved away, and the noises\ninside Number 30 stopped. But according to the woman who lives next door to the\nhouse that’s connected to Number 30, Fred the ghost hasn’t gone anywhere. He\nstill makes frequent visits to her side of the wall, and although he’s usually\nvery quiet, she claims that he sometimes stands in the room and glares at her\nwith menacing eyes. Under the scrutiny of historical research, though, most\nrecorded poltergeist stories have been shown to be frauds. Oftentimes they were\nnothing more than pranks put on by the homeowner, or the person who stood to gain\nthe most from the attention. But every now and then, a story comes along that defies\nexplanation, and when that story involves violent physical attacks and a\nserious threat to human lives, it becomes downright chilling. ', 'In 1999, a\nhomeless man broke into a large tomb in a prominent cemetery known as Greyfriars,\nin Edinburgh, Scotland. It was cold and rainy that night, and the man was\nlooking for shelter. I might have gone elsewhere to find a warm, dry place to\nsleep, but when you’re down and out, anything will do, right? This man wondered\nthrough the graveyard in the dark until he found a large mausoleum, something\nthat looked large enough to allow him to get out of the elements and sleep in relative\ncomfort. This one was known as “The Black Mausoleum”, and it was enormous. It\nresembles a large rotunda, with the spaces between the pillars filled in with\ncut stone. When the homeless man stumbled upon this tomb, it was exactly what\nhe had been looking for, and had plenty of room to stretch out and sleep in,\nand it was dry. So, he did what anyone desperate for shelter would do: he broke\nin. Because it’s rare to find a tomb with windows, the interior of the vault\nwas completely black. Thankfully, the man had a lighter or some other form of\nillumination, and he used it to explore. In the centre of the floor was a\nlarge, iron grate, similar to what you might find over a sewer drain or in the\nsidewalk over a subway tunnel in New York City. Beneath the grate was a staircase\nthat curved and twisted its way down to a lower level. I know - this sounds\nlike something out of an Indiana Jones movie, but believe me, it’s real, and it\ngets worse, because beneath the first level, at the bottom of the stairs, this\nhomeless man discovered four wooden coffins. They were, of course, very old,\nand the man probably assumed that, because of this, they would contain\nvaluables that he could sell. I imagine he set down whatever it was he was\nusing as a light on one of the nearby coffins, and then began to try and open\nanother one of them. When it didn’t work, he resorted to smashing the lid to\nbreak the lock, and that’s when he took a step backward. The boards in the\nfloor must have been very old. The man must have put his full weight in just the\nright spot. All the possibilities must have lined up perfectly in that moment.\nA brief groan from the wooden floor was followed by a loud crash, and the man\ntumbled backward into a long-forgotten pit, some part of an even lower level\nthat dated back centuries. The best guess that historians can make is that the\npit was actually used for the illegal dumping of bodies in the wake of the\nplague, in 1645. What they do know for sure, however, is that the pit was\nsealed very well. So sealed, in fact, that when this homeless man landed on the\npile of 350-year-old corpses, they were surprisingly well preserved. They weren’t\nskeletal and dry, like you might expect. No, these bodies were wet with\nsomething that resembled green slime. The clothing was intact, albeit ragged\nand torn, and their hair was matted to their shrivelled heads, and of course,\nthere were an overwhelming stench in the air. The man bolted, and I don’t think\nthere’s a single on of us who could blame him for doing so. Fearing for his\nlife, the man climbed out of the pit, up the stone stairs to the main vault,\nand out the door. He was in such a hurry that he even fell and cut his head on\nthe doorway to the mausoleum. Outside, a security guard was patrolling the area\nwith his canine partner, when the homeless man burst out of the tomb. Now,\nmaybe it was the blood running down the man’s face, maybe it was the white dust\nthat covered him from head to toe because of his adventures… below the tomb,\nmaybe it was just the simple sight of a pale, shrieking figure charging out from\na dark crypt – whatever the reason, when the guard saw the man, he turned tail\nand ran, just as fast as he could, away from the darkness of the cemetery, and\ninto the city beyond. ', 'As difficult\nas it is to imagine, the frightening events of that night in 1999 were just the\nbeginning. Like a tiny spark igniting an entire barn, the break-in at the Black\nMausoleum set in motion something that no one has since been able to adequately\nexplain. It turns out the mausoleum belonged to none other than Sir George Mackenzie,\na man who had died in 1690. Along with being a lawyer and Lord Advocate to the\ncrown of Scotland, Mackenzie had been instrumental in sending hundreds of\nPresbyterian Covenanters to their death in the late 17', ' century.\nToday, he is known as “Bloody Mackenzie”, and according to the local reports,\nthis invasion of his resting place set off a series of events that can only be\nblamed on a very angry spirit, and it didn’t wait very long. They day after the\nbreak-in, a woman was taking a walk through the cemetery. It’s unclear whether she\nwas a tourist interested in seeing the Covenanters prison area of the graveyard,\nor just a local out for a walk, but when she drew near to the mausoleum, she\ndecided to peer through one of the two small grates in the tomb door. As she stood\nthere, a gust of cold wind rushed out of the tomb with such force that she\nclaimed it knocked her backward and off the stone steps, landing on her back. A\nfew days later, another woman was found unconscious on the sidewalk outside the\ntomb, sprawled out on her back as if she had fallen. She claimed that invisible\nhands had grabbed her around the throat and attempted to strangle her. When she\npulled back the collar of her shit, her neck was ringed by a series of dark\nbruises, as if fingertips had been driven into her skin. Soon after, another tourist,\nthis time a young man, experienced something eerily similar. For others,\nthough, the consequences of visiting the tomb were more physical and lasting –\nsome people have found scratches on their arms, neck or chest, while others\nhave discovered burn marks. Many of these injuries disappear almost as quickly\nand mysteriously as they appeared. Some, though, claim to have been permanently\nscarred. All told, people have broken fingers, felt their hair pulled, been\npushed or struck, and all by an unseen force. People have even felt nauseous or\nnumb, or both, and not just one or two people, but hundreds. Sometimes these\nattacks happen near the tomb, and sometimes they happen later. ', 'One\nparticular story stands out: a former police officer reported participating in\na tour of the cemetery a few years ago. After returning to his hotel room that\nnight, he picked up the book he had been given on the tour that covered the\ndetails of the haunting. As he did, he felt a sharp pain, as if someone were\ntrying to burn him. When he ran to the mirror to check, he found five deep\nscratches on his neck, beneath his chin. The following morning, the officer\nvisited his mother and told her what happened. He also gave her the book –\naccording to him, he couldn’t stand to have it around any longer, and so he\nleft it at her house. When he called her later and asked about the book, he caught\nher in the bathroom. She was standing in front of the mirror, examining five,\nlong scratches on her throat. All told, nearly 400 people have claimed to have\nbeen attacked by something other-worldly around the tomb; almost 200 of those\npeople have actually passed out during a ghost tour. Sometimes, every person on\na tour will feel the exact same thing. Oftentimes, complete strangers will independently\nreport the exact same experience. The odd experiences extend beyond the tours.\nAn unusually high number of dead animals have been found in the area around Mackenzie’s\ntomb; unexplainable fires have broken out in nearby buildings; people have\nreported cold spots, and the usual photographic and electronic malfunctions have\noccurred there as well. Some have gone looking for an explanation for such a\nlarge number of unusual reports, but the theories are as varied as the types of\nattacks. One idea tries to connect the unlikely dots between the nearby Edinburgh\nUniversity’s artificial intelligence unit, which uses high voltage machinery,\nand the sandstone deep undergrown, beneath the ancient cemetery. The porous\nstone, they say, absorbs the energy and releases it later, causing odd\nexperiences. But this is a difficult theory to swallow, especially for the people\nwho have been physically assaulted by whatever it is that haunts the tomb. The\ncompany that conducts the tours through the graveyard is just as interested in\nfinding the cause, though, and that’s why they’ve spent years collecting photographs\nof injuries, first-hand accounts, letters from witnesses, and other\ndocumentation. Unfortunately, most of those records were destroyed in 2003,\nwhen a fire swept through their office. Everything inside the tour company’s\nspace was incinerated, but nothing more. Every single nearby building remained\nuntouched. The insurance company never found the cause. ', 'Outside of\nplaces with frequent earthquake activity, most people don’t think it’s normal\nfor photographs to fall off their walls, or for a chair to slide across the\nfloor, or to be knocked down by an unseen force. For some, these events are\nequal parts unusual and inconvenient. For others, though, they are frightening.\nIt’s difficult to say what’s really going on in these stories. Some events can\nbe chalked up to natural causes, or the human tendency to misinterpret the\nthings we see. We are very good at finding patterns, after all – it’s called\npareidolia, that moment when we see patterns where they don’t really exist. We\ndo this when we look up at clouds and see the shape of a turtle, but it happens\nsubconsciously as well. Our minds are always searching for patterns – or perhaps\nthere’s something more to the stories. What if there really are sinister,\nviolent spirits that can attack us if provoked? In many stories, priests are\nbrought in to bless the homes and perform exorcisms, a solution that certainly\nassumed there’s a supernatural source, and sometimes, it’s worked. In the years\nsince the break-in at the Black Mausoleum, there have been two attempts at\nexorcism. The second of those took place in 2000, just a year after the\nactivity began. Colin Grant, minister of a spiritualist church and professional\nexorcist, was brought into Greyfriars Cemetery. While standing in front of the\nBlack Mausoleum, he performed his ceremony. While doing so, he claimed to feel\noverwhelmed by the sensation of oppression, that hundreds of tormented souls\nwere swirling around him, trying to break through into our world. He said that\nhe had feared for his life, and he quickly left before he could finish. Just a\nfew weeks later, Colin Grant was found dead, victim of a sudden heart attack.

But when the\nrocks tumbled free and rolled down the hill, both boys noticed something odd\nabout them. They were nearly identical in shape, and that shape was eerily\nfamiliar. They headed down the hill one last time to take a closer look, and\nthat’s when they realised what they’d found: skulls. At first, the local police\nwere brought in to investigate the possibility of an unknown serial killer.\nThat many bodies all in one place was never a good sign, but it became obvious\nvery quickly that the real experts they needed were, in fact, archaeologists –\nand they were right. In the end, 29 graves were discovered in what turned out\nto be the remnants of a forgotten cemetery. Time and the elements had slowly\neroded away the graveyard, and the contents had been swallowed by the gravel.\nMany skeletons were still in their caskets, though, and it was inside one of\nthem, marked with brass tacks to form the initials of the occupant, that\nsomething ', ' was discovered.\nLong ago, it seems, someone had opened this casket shortly after burial and had\nthen made changes to the body. Specifically, they’d removed both femurs, the\nbones of the thigh, and placed them across the chest. Then, moving some of the\nribs and the breast bone out of the way, they placed the skull above them. It\nwas a real-life skull and crossbones, and its presence hinted at something\ndarker. The skeleton, you see, wasn’t just the remains of an ordinary early\nsettler of the area. This man was different, and the people who buried him knew\nit. According to them, he had been a vampire. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '. ', 'While it might be a surprise to some\npeople, graves like the one in Griswold are actually quite common. Today, we\nlive in the Bram Stoker era of vampires, so our expectations and imagery are\nhighly influenced by his novel and the world it evokes – Victorian gentlemen in\ndark cloaks, mysterious castles, sharp fangs protruding over blood red lips.\nBut the white face and red lips started life as nothing more than stage\nmake-up, an artefact from a 1924 theatrical production of the novel called ', 'Another feature we\nassociate with Dracula, his high-collar, also started there. With wires attached\nto the points of the collar, the actor playing Dracula could turn his back on\nthe audience and drop through a trap door, leaving an empty cape behind to fall\non the floor moments later. The true myth of the vampire, though, is far older\nthan Stoker. It’s an ancient tree with deep and twisted roots. As hard as it is\nfor popular culture to fathom, the legend of the vampire and the people who\nhunt it actually predate Dracula by centuries. Just a little further into the\npast than Bram Stoker, in the cradle of what would one day become the United\nStates, the people of New England were identifying vampire activity in their\nown towns and villages and then assembling teams of people to deal with what\nthey perceived as a threat. It turns out that Griswold was one of those\ncommunities. According to the archaeologists who studied the 29 graves, a vast\nmajority of them were contemporary to the vampire’s burial, and most of those\nshowed signs of an illness. Tuberculosis is the most likely guess, which goes a\nlong way toward explaining why the people did what they did. The folklore was\nclear – the first to die from an illness was usually the cause of the outbreak\nthat followed. Patient 0 might be in the grave, sure, but they were still at\nwork, slowly draining the lives of the others. ', 'Because of this belief, bodies all across\nthe north-east were routinely exhumed and destroyed in one way or another. In\nmany ways, it was as if the old superstitions were clawing their way out of the\ndepths of the past to haunt the living. The details of another case from Stafford,\nConnecticut in the late 1870s illustrate the ritual perfectly. After a family\nthere lost five of their six daughters to illness, the first to have passed\naway was dug up and examined. This is what was recorded about the event:\n“Exhumation has revealed a heart and lungs,” they wrote, “still fresh and\nliving, encased in rotten and slimy integuments, and in which, after burning\nthese portions of the defunct, a living relative, else doomed and hastening to\nthe grave, has suddenly and miraculously recovered”. This sort of macabre\ncommunity event happened frequently in places like Connecticut, Vermont, New\nYork, New Hampshire and even Ontario, Canada, and long-time listeners of ', 'will of course remember the subject\nof the very first episode, and how the family of Mercy Brown in Rhode Island\nexhumed her body after others died, doing a very similar thing. Mercy Brown\nwasn’t the first American vampire, though. As far as we can tell, that honour\ngoes to the wife of Isaac Burton of Manchester, Vermont, all the way back in\n1793, and for as chilling and dark the exhumation of Mercy Brown might have\nbeen, the Burton incident puts that story to shame. ', 'Captain Isaac Burton married Rachel Harris\nin 1789, but their marriage was brief. Within months of the wedding, Rachel\ntook sick with Tuberculosis, what was then called “consumption” because of the\nway the disease seemed to waste the person away, as if they were being consumed\nby something unseen. Rachel soon died, leaving her husband a young widower, but\nthat didn’t last long. Burton married again in April of 1791, this time to a\nwoman named Hulda Powell. But again, within just two years of their marriage,\nBurton’s bride became ill. Friends and neighbours started to whisper and as\npeople are prone to do, they began to try and draw conclusions. Unanswered questions\nbother us, so we tend to look for reasons, and the people of Manchester thought\nthey knew why Hulda was sick. Although Isaac’s wife, Rachel, had been dead for\nnearly three years, the people of Manchester suggested that she was the cause.\nClearly, from her new home in the graveyard, she was draining the life from her\nhusband’s new bride. With Burton’s permission, the town prepared to exhume her\nand end the curse. The town blacksmith brought a portable forge to the\ngravesite and nearly 1000 people gathered there to watch the grim ceremony\nunfold. Rachel’s liver, heart and lungs were all removed from her corpse and\nthen reduced to ashes. Sadly, though, Hulda Burton never recovered, and she\ndied a few months later. This ancient ritual, as far as the people of\nManchester, Vermont were concerned, had somehow failed them. They did what they\nhad been taught to do, as unpleasant as it must have been, and yet it hadn’t\nworked – which was odd, because that hadn’t always been the case. ', 'A lot of what we think we know about the\nroots of the vampire legend is thanks to ', ',\nthe novel by Bram Stoker. Most of us know the basics – Stoker built a mythology\naround a historical figure from the fifth century named Vlad III. Vlad was from\nthe kingdom of Wallachia, now part of modern-day Romania. Vlad had two titles:\nVlad ', 'which meant “The\nImpaler”, referred to his brutal military tactics in defence of his country;\nthe other, Vlad ', ', or “The\nDragon”, referred to his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a military\norder founded to protect Christian Europe from the armies of the invading\nOttoman Empire. But Bram Stoker never travelled to Romania. The castle that he\ndescribes as the home of Dracula, a real-life fortress known as Bran Castle,\nwas just an image he found in a book that he felt captured the mood he was\naiming for. Bran Castle, as far as historians can tell, has no connection to\nVlad III whatsoever. The notion of a vampire, or at least of an undead creature\nthat feeds on the living, does have roots in the area, though. Stoker was\nclose, but he missed the mark by a little more than 300 miles. The real roots\nof the legend, according to most historians, can be found in modern-day Serbia.\nSerbia of today sits at the south-western corner of Romania, just south of\nHungary. Between 1718 and 1739, the country passed briefly from the hands of\nthe Ottoman Empire to the control of the Austrians. Because of its place\nbetween these two empires, the land was devastated by war and destruction and\npeople were frequently moved around in service to the military, and as is often\nthe case, when people cross borders, so do ideas. ', 'Petar Blagojevich was a Serbian peasant in\nthe village of Kisiljevo in the early 1700s. Not much is known about his life,\nbut we do know that he was married and had at least one son, and in 1725,\nthrough causes unknown, Petar died at the age of 62. In most stories, that’s\nthe end, but not here. You probably knew that, though, didn’t you? In the eight\ndays that followed Petar’s death, other people in the village began to pass\naway. Nine of them, in fact, and all of them made startling claims on their\ndeath beds, details that seemed impossible to prove but were somehow the same\nin each case. Each person was adamant that Petar Blagojevich, their recently\ndeceased neighbour, had come to them in the night and attacked them. Petar’s\nwidow even made the startling claim that her dead husband had actually walked\ninto her home and asked for, of all things, his shoes. She believed so strongly\nin this visit that she moved to another village to avoid future visits. The\nrest of the people of Kisiljevo took notice. Something had to be done, and that\nwould begin with digging up Petar’s corpse. Inside the coffin, they found\nPetar’s body to be remarkably preserved. Some noticed how the man’s nails and\nhair had grown. Others remarked on the condition of his skin, which was flush\nand bright, not pale. It wasn’t natural, they said, and something had to be\ndone. They turned to a man named Frombald, a local representative of the\nAustrian government, and together with the help of a priest he examined the\nbody for himself. In his written report, he confirmed the earlier findings and\nadded his observation that fresh blood could be seen inside Petar’s mouth.\nFrombald describes how the people of the village were overcome with fear and\noutrage, and how they proceeded to drive a wooden stake through the corpse’s\nheart. Then, still afraid of what the creature might be able to do to them in\nthe future, the people burnt the body. Frombald’s report details all of it, but\nhe also makes the disclaimer that he wasn’t responsible for the villager’s\nactions. He said that it was fear that drove them to it, nothing more. Petar’s\nstory was powerful, and it created a panic that quickly spread throughout the\nregion. It was the first event of its kind in history to be recorded in\nofficial government documents, but that report was still missing an official\ncause. Without it, the stories might have died where they started. But then,\njust a year later, something happened, and the legend had never been the same. ', 'Arnold Paole was a former soldier, one of\nthe many men transplanted by the Austrian government in an effort to defend and\npolice their newly acquired territory. No one is sure where he was born, but\nhis final years were spent in a Serbian village along the great Morava river,\nnear Paraćin.\nIn his post-war life, Arnold became a farmer, and he frequently told stories\nfrom days gone by. In one such story, Arnold claimed that he had been attacked\nby a vampire years before while living in Kosovo. He survived, but the injury\ncontinued to plague him until he finally took action. He said that he cured\nhimself by eating soil from the grave of the suspected vampire, and then, after\ndigging up the vampire’s body, he collected some of its blood and smeared it on\nhimself. And that was it – according to Arnold and the folklore that drove him\nto it, he was cured. When he died in a farming accident in 1726, though, people\nbegan to wonder, because within a month of his death at least four other people\nin town complained that Arnold had visited them in the night and attacked them.\nWhen those people died, the villagers began to whisper in fear. They remembered\nArnold’s stories – stories of being attacked by a vampire, of taking on the\ndisease himself, stories of his own attempt to cure himself. But what if it\nhadn’t worked? Out of suspicion and doubt, they decided to exhume his body and\nexamine it. Here, for what was most likely the first time in recorded history,\nthe story of the vampire was taking on the form of a communicable disease,\ntransmitted from person to person through biting. This might seem obvious to us\nnow, but we’ve all grown up with the legend fully formed. To the people of this\nsmall, Serbian village, though, this was something new and horrific. What they\nfound seemed like conclusive evidence, too: fresh skin, new nails, longer hair\nand beard. Arnold even had blood in his mouth. Putting ourselves in their\ncontext, it’s easy to see how they might have been chilled with fear – so they\ndrove a stake through his heart. One witness claimed that, as the stake pierced\nthe corpse’s chest, the body groaned and bled. Unsure of what else to do, they\nburned the body, and then they did the same to the four who had died after\nclaiming Arnold attacked them. They covered all their bases, so to speak, and\nthen walked away. ', 'Five years later, though, another outbreak\nspread through the village. We know this because so many people died that the\nAustrian government sent a team of military physicians from Belgrade to investigate\nthe situation. These men, led by two officials named Glaser and Flückinger,\nwere special, though, because they were trained in communicable diseases, which\nwas a good thing. By January 7', ' of 1731, just eight weeks after the\nbeginning of the outbreak, 17 people had died. At first, Glaser had looked for\nsigns of a contagious disease, but came up empty-handed. He noted signs of mild\nmalnutrition, but there was nothing deadly that could be found. The clock was\nticking, though. The villagers were living in such fear that they had been\ngathering together into large groups each night, taking turns keeping watch for\nthe creatures they believed were responsible. They even threatened to pack up\nand move elsewhere. Something needed to be done, and quickly. Thankfully, there\nwere suspects. The first was a young woman named Stana, a recent newcomer to\nthe village who had died during childbirth early on in the outbreak. It seemed\nto have been a sickness that took her life, but there were other clues. Stana\nhad confessed to smearing vampire blood on herself years before as protection,\nbut that, the villagers claimed, had backfired, and most likely turned her into\none instead. The other suspect was an older woman named Milica. She was also\nfrom another part of Serbia, and had arrived shortly after Arnold’s death. Like\nso many others, she had a history. Neighbours claimed that she was a good woman\nwho never did anything intentionally wicked, but she had told them once of how\nshe’d eaten meat from a sheep killed by a vampire, and that seemed like\nevidence enough to push the investigation to go deeper… literally. ', 'With permission from Belgrade, Glaser and\nthe villagers exhumed all of the recently deceased, opening their coffins for a\nfull examination, and while logic and science should have prevailed in a situation\nlike that, what they found only deepened their belief in the supernatural. Of\nthe 17 bodies, only five appeared normal, in that they had begun to decay in a\nmanner that should be expected. These were reburied and considered safe, but it\nwas the other 12 that alarmed the villagers and the government men alike,\nbecause these bodies were still fresh. In the report filed in Belgrade in\nJanuary of 1732, signed by all five of the government physicians who witnessed\nthe exhumations, these 12 bodies were completely untouched by decay, organs\nstill held fresh blood, their skin was healthy and firm, and new nails and hair\nhad grown since burial. These are all normal occurrences as we understand\ndecomposition today, but three centuries ago it was less about science and more\nabout superstition. This didn’t seem normal to them, and so when the physician\nwrote their report, they used a term that, until that very moment, had never\nappeared in any historical account of such a case. They described the bodies as\n“vampiric”. In the face of unanswered questions, the only conclusion they could\ncommit to was that each of the 12 bodies had been found in a “vampiric”\ncondition. With that, the villagers did what their tradition demanded: they\nremoved the heads from each corpse, gathered all the remains into a pile, and then\nburned the whole thing. The threat to the village was finally dead and gone, but\nit was too late. Something new had been born, something more powerful than a\nmonster, something that lives centuries and spreads like fire: a legend. ', '[21:20]', 'Many aspects of folklore haven’t faired\ntoo well under the critical eye of science. Today, we have a much deeper\nunderstanding of how illness and disease really works, and while experts are\nstill careful to explain that every corpse decomposes in a slightly unique way,\nwe have a better grasp of the full picture now than any previous time in history.\nAnswers, when we can find them, come as a relief. It’s safe to say that we don’t\nhave to fear a vampiric infection when the people around us get sick today, but\nthere were still people at the centre of these ancient stories, normal folk\nlike you and me, who simply wanted to do what was right. We might do it\ndifferently today, but it’s hard to fault them for trying. Answers don’t kill\nevery myth, though. Vampire stories, like their immortal subjects, have simply refused\nto die. In fact, they can still be found, if you know where to look for them.\nIn the small, Romanian village of Marotinu de Sus, near the south-western\ncorner that borders Bulgaria and Serbia, authorities were called in to investigate\nan illegal exhumation, but this wasn’t 1704 or even 1804. This happened just a\ndecade ago. Petre Toma had been the clan leader there in the village, but after\na lifetime of illness and hard drinking, his accidental death in the field\nalmost came as a relief to his family and friends. That’s how they put it, at\nleast. So, when he was buried in December of 2003, the community moved on. But\nindividuals from Petre’s family began to get sick. First it was his niece, Mirela\nMarinescu. She complained that her uncle had attacked her in her dreams. Her\nhusband made the same claim, and both offered their illness as proof. Even\ntheir infant child was not well. Thankfully, the elders of the village immediately\nknew why. In response to her story, six men gathered together one evening in\nearly 2004. They entered the local graveyard close to midnight, and then travelled\nto the burial site of Petra Toma. Using hammers and chisels, they broke through\nthe stone slab that covered the grave and then moved the pieces aside. They\ndrank as they worked. Can you really blame them? They were opening the grave of\na recently deceased member of their community, but I think it was more than\nthat. In their minds, they were putting their lives in danger, because there,\ninside the grave and just uncovered, lay the stuff of nightmares – a vampire. What\nthese men did next will sound strangely familiar, but to them it was simply the\ncontinuation of centuries of tradition. They cut open the body using a knife\nand a saw, they pried the ribs apart with a pitchfork, and then cut out the\nheart. According to one of the men who was there, when the heart was removed,\nthey found it full of fresh blood. Proof, to them at least, that Petre had been\nfeeding on the village. When they pulled it free, the witness said that the\nbody audibly sighed, and then went limp. It’s hard to prove something that six\nincredibly superstitious men – men who had been drinking all night, mind you –\nclaimed they witnessed in a dark cemetery, but to them it was pure, unaltered\ntruth. They then used the pitchfork to carry the heart out of the cemetery and\nacross the road to a field, where they set it on fire. Once it was burnt\ncompletely, they collected the ashes and funnelled them into a bottle of water.\nThey offered this tonic to the sick family, who willingly drank it. It was,\nafter all, what they had been taught to do, and amazingly, everyone recovered. No\none died of whatever illness they were suffering from, and no one reported\nvisits from Petre Toma after that. In their mind, the nightmare was over. These\nmen had saved their lives. Maybe something evil and contagious has survived for\ncenturies after all, spreading across borders and oceans. It’s certainly left a\ntrail of horrific events in its wake, and its influenced countless tales and\nsuperstitions, all of which seem to point to a real-life cause. But far from\nbeing unique to Serbia or Romania, this thing is global. And as if that weren’t\nenough, this horrible, ageless monster is, and always had been, right inside\neach of us. Like a vampiric curse, we carry it in our blood, but its probably not\nwhat you’d expect. It’s fear. ', '[Closing statements]']"

It’s a month known for its focus on folklore, legend and superstition.\nWe’ll be back to a biweekly schedule in November, but October calls for\nsomething special. No tricks, but I do hope that you’ll enjoy the extra treats.\nAnd now, on with the show. ', 'One of the\nmost chilling historical events of the last 200 years, one that has fascinated\nme for most of my life, is the 1846 pioneer journey of the families and\nemployees of James Reed and George Donner. I can’t think of a last name that\nevokes as much emotion, as much fear, and as much instant visual imagery, as\nthe Donner name. In the years since that fateful winter, the name has become\nsynonymous with mountain passes, frozen bodies huddled around dead campfires,\nand of course, cannibalism. The Donner party has a way of stopping us in our\ntracks. We are morbidly fascinated with their tragic journey, but even more so,\nwe’re amazed at how far they went to stay alive. Their story forces us to look\nstraight into the face of a fear that most people bury deep beneath the surface:\npeople eating other people. We can look for justification. We can research the\nreasons behind their situation and write sterile and safe papers about the\nhorrible plight they found themselves in. But at the end of the day, we are\nsimply and powerfully horrified. From the story of Hansel and Gretel to the\nmodern TV show ', 'we have\nalways maintained a repulsive fascination with those who cross the line. We\ncan’t stand to think about it, and yet we can’t look away, either. Maybe it has\nto do with the morbid symbolism of one body within another. Perhaps it’s the\nrealization that, like cattle or wild game, humans can sometimes become food\nfor something, or someone, else. Or perhaps, deep down, we’re fascinated with\ncannibalism because we believe that maybe, just maybe, it could turn us into\nmonsters. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '.\n', 'Humans\nhave been confronted with cannibalism for a very long time. Archaeologists have\ndiscovered signs of the act that date back tens of thousands of years. In some\ninstances, the reasons have clearly been ritualistic, while others have been\ndriven by food shortages. There’s a lot we still don’t know, but what we do\nunderstand has highlighted the fact that, long ago, it was far more common than\nit is today. In the realm of ancient history, Greek and Roman historians\nrecorded instances related to war and conquering. The Roman siege of Jerusalem\nin 70AD, for example, resulted in scattered reports of cannibalism. Decades\nlater, when the Romans attacked Numantia, historians in Alexandria recorded\nsimilar stories. One interesting observation is that, over the centuries, the\naccusation of cannibalism has been a political and colonial tool. The ancient\nGreeks assumed that all non-Hellenistic peoples were simply barbarians and\ncannibals and used it to justify their hostility toward them. For many empires,\neven up through the British Empire of the 17', ' and 18', '\ncenturies, it was a way to demonise a people group, and to give themselves\npermission to come in and take over – to bring civilization, so to speak, which\nled to deep prejudice against these people groups. One example from 1820 stands\nout: that was the year a whaling ship called the ', 'was rammed and sunk by one of the whales it was pursuing. If\nthat plot sounds familiar at all, it’s because that story went on to inspire\nthe novel ', '. After the\naccident, the captain and crew of 21 boarded three of their whale boats. They\nhad two choices for a route to safety: they could sail 3000 miles against the\nwind to Chile, or half the distance ', '\nthe wind to the Marquesas Islands. But the Marquesans were rumoured to be\ncannibals, so they took the longer route. As a result, the crew spent months at\nsea, and eventually resorted to cannibalism themselves to survive. Reality can\nbe cruel – and ironic, apparently. But something darker sits at the centre of\nmany cannibalism stories. ', 'At the\ncore of almost all Native American cultures, across Canada and the northern part\nof what is now the United States, there are stories of the supernatural effects\nthat eating other humans can have on a person. Each tribe seems to refer to the\nstories with different terms, but they’re all eerily similar. Wabanaki legend\nspeaks of the man-eating snow giant, ', '.\nThe Cree tell tales of the ', ',\nalso a giant and also a man-eater. The Micmac tribes of northern Maine up\nthrough Nova Scotia tell stories of the ', ',\ncreatures that were once human but had been transformed through some horrible\ncrime that was usually cannibalism. The most common name for these creatures\namong Native Americans, however, is one we already know from popular culture.\nThey are the ', ', a creature that\nwas once human, but had been transformed by their hunger for human flesh into a\nmonster that can’t ever be satisfied. One Native American description of the\ncreature claims that a ', 'is\ntaller than a grown man, with a gaunt body and dead skin that seems to be pulled\ntoo tightly over its bones. Tales speak of the tangle of antlers upon its head,\nand the deep eye sockets that seem to be dead inside, and it smelled of death\nand decay. In Cree mythology, though, the ', 'was simply a human who had become possessed by an evil spirit. It would\ntake over, and then turn its hunger and hatred toward the people around it. To\nthe Cree, the ', 'was most often\njust another person: a neighbour, a friend, a sister, a son. There was no hope\nfor those who were transformed into man-eating creatures. There was only one\nsolution available: these creatures must be hunted and killed. It’s fantasy;\nit’s a cultural meta-narrative about something else, something deeper – at\nleast, that’s what the anthropologists tell us. But some have taken those\nlegends at face value. ', 'Swift\nRunner was a Native American from the Cree tribe that lived in the western\nportion of Canada. He was born in the early 1800s and worked as a hunter and\ntrapper in the north country, near Fort Edmonton, as well as a guide for the\nnorth-west mounted police. He was a big man, standing over 6ft tall, and\naccording to the reports, he was well-liked and respected among his people. He\nand his wife had six children; it was said that he was a loving father who\ncared deeply for his family, which is why the winter of 1878 will be remembered\nas a tragedy. According to the reports, Swift Runner stumbled into a Catholic\nmission in St. Albert, sometime in the spring of 1879. He was distraught and\nunfocused; he told the priest that the winter had been harsh, and that his\nentire family had starved to death. He was, in fact, the only one to make it\nout alive. But something didn’t sit right with the priest. For one thing, Swift\nRunner didn’t look like a man who had endured starvation throughout the winter\nmonths – he was a solid 200lb and seemed healthy and strong. Another hint that\nall was not well were his nightmares, which often ended with him screaming in\nthe night. In the end, the priests reached out to the mounted police. A group\nof investigators were dispatched to look into the matter, and they took Swift\nRunner back to his winter camp. To his credit, Swift Runner was helpful – he\nimmediately showed the men a small grave near the campsite, and explained that\nit was the grave of one of his boys. They even went as far as to open the\ngrave, and everything lined up with his story. They were the bones of a child,\nand it was safe to assume the child was Swift Runner’s. But then the police\nfound other clues that began to paint a darker picture. Around the camp in\nscattered locations, they began to uncover more bones and a skull. Not just a\nfew, either. There were bones everywhere. Some of the larger bones were hollow\nand snapped in half, clearly the result of someone sucking the marrow out. They\nalso found bits of flesh and hair. The evidence began to pile up, and they\nlooked to Swift Runner for an explanation, and that’s when he told them the\ntruth. According to him, a ', 'spirit\ncame into their camp during the winter. It spoke to him and told him to eat his\nfamily. At first, he resisted, ignoring the voice. But slowly, over time, the ', 'took control, and then it took\naction. Swift Runner’s wife was the first to die, then one of the younger boys,\nand one by one his family was killed and eaten. Then the creature moved on to\nhis mother-in-law, and his own brother. To Swift Runner, it was cold fact – a\nmonster had eaten his family, and the police agreed. They simply disagreed on\nthe identity of that monster. The mutilated human remains were collected and transported\nto Fort Saskatchewan, along with Swift Runner himself. His trial began on\nAugust 8', ' of 1879, and it was about as cut and dried as it could\nbe. Both the judge and jury refused to accept the story of the ', '. They saw the man as a murderer\nand sentenced him to be hanged. Over 60 people gathered at the fort on December\n20', ' to watch the hanging. One witness to the execution, a man who\nhad reportedly seen several hangings in his life, was said to have slapped his\nthigh and declared “Boys, that was the prettiest hanging I’ve ever seen”. ', 'The Severn\nriver in Ontario winds through the homeland of the Sandy Lake first nation.\nThis area of Canada is so isolated that it wasn’t until the early decades of\nthe 20', ' century that the western world really made an effort and\nreach out and connect with the people who lived there. It’s way up in the far\nwestern corner of Ontario, in the kind of territory where lakes have islands\nthat have their own lakes. By the late 1800s, the Hudson Bay Company had closed\ndown enough of its trading posts that the closest one to Sandy Lake was over\n140 miles away. That was a 50 hour walk across rough terrain. I’m not really\nsure that “isolated” is a strong enough word to use here, the place was practically\nalien. Jack Fiddler was born in the 1830s - or maybe it was the 1840s, most\npeople aren’t sure, but we know that he was a Cree Indian, and he worked as a\ntrader. He made the trek between the villages and the trading post for a\nliving, and in the process, he met lots of people. He was also the son of the\nSandy Lake people’s shaman, and over his lifetime he had five wives and many,\nmany children. When Jack’s father died in 1891, he took over as the leader of\nthe Sandy Lake people. Now, that sounds fancy, but in reality, there were only\nroughly 120 people living in this community. He had influence over the wider\ngeographical area as well, but his real power came from his role as the tribal\nshaman. A shaman’s powers were a vital part of his leadership – when Jack\nbecame the spiritual leader of his people, he became the keeper of their\nancient traditions and their guardian against the approaching darkness that was\nwestern civilization. There are even legends that tell of Jack Fiddler curing\nillnesses. But most importantly, Jack became their first and only defence\nagainst the ', ', often called\nupon to hunt down and kill them. I know, this sounds like the stuff of comic\nbooks or Hollywood movies, but Jack Fiddler lives up to the hype. In fact, over\nhis lifetime, he claimed to have defeated 14 of the monsters. But Jack didn’t\ngo looking for tall, monstrous creatures with antlers and bony bodies. No, he\nunderstood the ', 'to be more\nsubtle. Some ', ', Jack said, had\nbeen sent to attack his people by other shamans. Others had been members of his\nown tribe, who seemed to have been overtaken with an unstoppable urge to eat\nhuman flesh. When it was his own people, Jack said that he and his brother,\nJoseph, were the ones called upon to do the hard thing and kill the individuals.\nAnd not just kill them, no, that wasn’t enough to stop the possession. You see,\nit was believed that the ', '’s\nspirit could actually hop from one body to the next, so those who died as a\nresult of their possession were often burned to stop the infection from\nspreading. For the Sandy Lake people, and many of the other Native American\ntribes that cover much of the northern half of North America, the ', 'stories were more than just here\nsay. It was an idea that was rooted in ancient tradition. Ceremonies were built\naround the legend. People were warned and educated constantly about the danger\nthis creature posed to the community, and then suddenly, all of that tradition\nand history ran headlong into the modern world, and the results were\ndisastrous.', ' Some time in 1905, Joseph Fiddler’s\ndaughter-in-law was brought to Jack’s village. She was very sick, according to\nmultiple first-hand accounts. She was in deep pain that often drove her to cry\nout and moan and constantly make noise. Some of the women tending to her would\neven have to hold her down to keep her under control. Jack and his brother,\nJoseph, were brought in. They were old men by then, both in their 80s and very\nfrail, but they knew what was causing her illness, and they knew how to stop it.\nThey had done it many times before, and so they did what they did best: they\ntook a thin rope and looped it over her head, and then, slowly, they tightened\nit. It wasn’t done in cold blood - it was a calculated decision that these men\ncame to only after deep discussion, but it was driven by fear. If the ', 'spirit inside her had been\nallowed to take control, there was no telling how destructive it might have\nbecome. To them, this was preventative, it was mercy, a form of euthanasia that\nprotected the entire community. The Fiddlers were mere instruments in the hands\nof a culture driven by superstition. Witnesses testify to their quiet,\ndignified nature, but it didn’t help; the men were brought before a six-man\njury later that year. The Toronto newspapers printed sensational headlines\nabout the trial, crying out against devil worship and murder, and in response,\npeople around the country cried out for a conviction. And they were guilty,\nwithout question. These men had killed a member of their family – it might not\nhave been a crime of passion, but they were still murderers, so when they final\nverdict came down, it was far from a surprise: guilty. The Cree people of Sandy\nLake lost their leader, they lost two of the most respected elders of their\ntiny community, and most frightening to them, they lost their last remaining ', 'hunters. Real or not, these men\nhad been a wall that kept the darkness and fear at bay, and now that wall was\ngone. ', 'Superstition\nhas often served to answer our questions and calm our fears. From the\nChangelings of Ireland to the vampires of New England, the stories we tell have\nhelped us explain the mysteries we don’t understand. That’s not all\nsuperstition does, I know, but it makes up a lot of the examples we find. We\nfear the unknown and we come up with anything to explain it away. Cannibalism\nis something that humans have feared for a very, very long time, not because\nwe’re actually convinced it could change us into supernatural monsters. No, at\nthe root of it all, cannibalism is just a line that we don’t think we should\ncross, and rightly so. History is littered with examples of people who have\ncrossed the line, not because their life was at risk or because they had no\nchoice, but because of something darker. Deep belief in the folklore of their\nupbringing, mental instability, premeditated violence… whatever the reason,\nevery example reveals humans to be the true monsters, capable of anything, even\nthe things we fear the most. Maybe Jack Fiddler understood this; perhaps he\nknew that he represented the final entry in a vital, ancient lineage. He saw a\nworld ill-equipped to defend itself against the evils he had fought all his\nlife. I have to imagine that the idea of it simply exhausted him. On September\n30', ', 1907, while on a walk outside with a police constable, Jack\nescaped into the woods, where he strangled himself with the sash he wore. His\nbrother would later die in prison from tuberculosis. On July 30', ',\n2008, a man named Tim Mclean was riding a greyhound bus along the\ntrans-Canadian highway in Manitoba, when one of the other passengers attacked\nand killed him. The man, Vince Weiguang, did more than just kill Mclean,\nthough. He stabbed him, beheaded him, and then proceeded to cannibalise the\nbody. Was the killer just insane, or did he perhaps meet an evil spirit there, on\nhis trip through ', 'territory?\nThat’s a question that would be impossible to answer for certain, but the\ncourts ruled in favour of insanity. In the end, he was held in a high security\nmental institute in Manitoba, but he stayed there for less than a decade.\nEarlier this year, in May of 2015, he was released back into society.

Being around others has a way of calming our\nsouls, and imparting a bit of safety, even if only in theory. But sometimes,\neven crowds of people and scores of friends can’t fight the crippling feeling\nthat we are, in the end, isolated and alone. Humans have become very good at\nchasing away that feeling, though. When darkness threatens to cut us off from\nthe world around us, we discovered fire, and then electrical lights. We use\ntechnology today to help us stay connected to friends and relatives who live\nthousands of miles away, and yet the feeling of loneliness grows deeper every\nyear. We’ve learnt to harness tools to fight it, though. In ancient cultures,\nin the days before Facebook and the printing press, if you can fathom that, society\nfought the feeling of being alone with story. Each culture developed a set of\ntales, a mythology and surrounding lore, that filled in the cracks. These stories\nexplained the unexplainable, they filled the dark night with figures and\nshapes, and they gave people, lonely or not, something else to talk about –\nsomething ', '. Some tales were\nthere to teach; some preached morals through analogy; others offered a word of\nwarning or a lesson that would keep children safe. In the end, though, all of\nthem did something that we couldn’t do on our own: they put us in our place.\nThey offer perspective. It might seem like we’re at the top of the food chain,\nbut what if we’re not? From the ancient hills of Iceland and Brazil, to the\nblack-top streets of urban America, our fascination with the “others” has been\na constant, unrelenting obsession. But while most stories only make us smile at\nthe pure fantasy of it all, there are some that defy dismissal. They leave us\nwith more questions than answers, and they force us to come to grips with a\nfrightening truth: if we’re not alone in this world, then we’re also not safe.\nI’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '. ', 'In Greek\nMythology, we have stories of creatures that were called the ', '. The ', ' were a tribe of diminutive humans, smaller than the Greeks,\nwho were often encountered in battle, and these stories have been around for\nthousands of years. We even have images of ', '\nbattles on pottery found in tombs dating back to the 5', ' century BC.\n1', ' century Roman historian, Pliny the Elder, recorded that the ', 'were said to go on annual journeys\nfrom their homeland in the mountains. They would arm themselves for battle and\nclimb onto their rams and goats, and ride down to the sea, where they would\nhunt the cranes that nested at the shore. In South America, there are tales of\ncreatures called the ', ', a figure\nof Mayan mythology. They said to be between one to two meters tall, hairless,\nand dressed in traditional Mayan clothing. Like the ', ' of the Native American tribes of North America, the ', ' are said to be troublemakers, disrupting\ncrops and wreaking havoc. According to tradition, the ', ' will move into an area every time a new farm is established.\nMayan farmers were said to build small, two-storey houses in the middle of\ntheir cornfields, where these creatures would live. For the first seven years,\nthe ', ' would help the corn grow and\npatrol the fields at night. Once those seven years were up, however, they\nturned on the farmers, who would put windows and doors on the little houses to\ntrap the creatures inside. The ancient Picts of the Orkney Islands, off the north-eastern\ntip of Scotland, spoke of a creature they called the ', ', or sometimes, the ', '.\nThey were small, humanoid beings, described as being ugly and shy, who lived in\nthe mounds and rock outcroppings in the surrounding woods. Like many of the\nother legends of small people around the world, the ', ' were said to be mischievous. In particular, they were said to\nlove music - so much, in fact, that it was thought that they kidnapped musicians\nand took them back to their homes so that they could enjoy the music there. In\naddition, it was common for the people of Shetland to bless their children each\nYule day as a way of protecting them from the ', '. Nearby, in Ireland, there are tales of similar creatures,\nsmall and hairless, called the ', '.\nThe ', ' are said to stand roughly\n3ft tall, and like the ', ', they too\nlive in large, stone outcroppings. According to legend, they can cause trouble\nand chaos within a community, so much so that the local people have developed traditions\nmeant to keep them happy.In Country Down, for instance, farmers still to this\nday leave behind a “', '’s share”\nwhen they harvest their crops. It’s an offering to the creatures, to keep them\nhappy and ward off their mischief. But the ', '\nisn’t unique to Ireland. In Cornish mythology, there’s a small, humanlike\ncreature known as the ', ', a kind\nof hobgoblin. Wales is home to a similar creature with a reputation as a\ntrickster goblin. It was said to knock on doors and then disappear before\npeople inside opened them. And in France, a common term for stone outcroppings\nand megalithic structures is ', '.\nOh, and if you’re a fan of Shakespeare’s play “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, you\nmight remember the character Puck, the clever and mischievous elf. The name\nPuck, it turns out, is an Anglicization of the mythical creature, ', ' or ', '. I’ll stop, but I think you get the point. There doesn’t seem\nto be a culture in the world that hasn’t invented a story about smaller people,\nthe “others” that live at the periphery of our world. It’s not surprising,\neither – many of these cultures have a deep history of invading nations, and\nthat kind of past can cause anyone to spend a lot of time looking over their\nshoulder. These stories are deep, and often allegorical; they mean something,\nsure, but they aren’t rooted in reality. No one has captured a ', ' or taken photographs of an ', ' stepping out of its tiny, stone\nbuilding. But that doesn’t mean there’s no evidence. In fact, there are some\nlegends that come a lot closer to the surface than you might have thought possible\n- and that might not be a good thing.', 'The Shoshone\ntribe of Native Americans that live in the Rocky Mountains have been there for\nthousands of years. Their lands span much of the countryside around the Rockies,\nbut they also built seasonal homes, up high in the mountains, sometimes\n10,000ft above sea level. One of the Shoshone legends is that of a tribe of\ntiny people, known as the ', '. One\nstory tells of a man who rode up a small trail into the Wind River Mountains to\ncheck on his cattle. While he was travelling the narrow path, one of these\ncreatures stepped out and stopped him. This was his trail, the little man said,\nand the rancher couldn’t use it anymore. The man ignored the tiny person and\ncontinued on toward his cattle, and this angered the ', '. The tiny creature took aim with his bow and fired a\npoisonous arrow at the man’s arm. From that day on, the story goes, the rancher\nwas never able to use his arm again. The ', 'are just myth, or at least that’s what most people think. But in 1932, that\nperception changed, when two prospectors, Cecil Mayne and Frank Carr, found a mummy\nin a cave in the Pedro Mountains of Wyoming. They said it had been sitting\nupright on a ledge in the cave, as if it had been waiting for them. The mummy\nwas small (honestly, it’s only about six inches tall), but had the proportions\nof an adult. The two men had found it on a ledge, sitting upright, mummified by\nthe dry Wyoming climate. After its discovery, the mummy changed hands a number\nof times. Photographs were taken, as well as an x-ray, but by 1950, it had vanished,\nnever to be seen again. In 1994, after an episode of ', ' asked viewers to help them locate the missing\nmummy, a second mummy came to light. This one was a female, with blonde hair,\nbut it was roughly the same size, and also from a mountain cave. This time,\nmedical experts were able to study it, and what they discovered was shocking:\nit wasn’t an adult after all, it was an infant that had been born with a condition\nknown as Anencephaly, which explained the adult-like proportions of the body\nand head. Like the first mummy, this second one disappeared shortly after the\nexamination, and the family who owned it vanished with it. ', 'Halfway\naround the world, in Indonesia, there are stories of small, humanlike creatures\ncalled the ', ' Even though\ntheir name sounds a lot like a Belinda Carlisle cover band, these creatures\nwere said to strike fear in the hearts of the neighbouring tribes. According to\nthe story, the ', 'had flat\nnoses and wide mouths, and spoke in short grunts and squawks. They were known\nto steal food from the local villages, and sometimes even children, and\napparently one of these incidents from the 1800s led to an extermination. The\nNage people of Flores, Indonesia, claimed that generations ago, the ', 'stole some of their food, and\nthe Nage people chased them to a cave, where they burnt them all alive - all but\none pair, male and female, that managed to escape into the woods. The stories\nare full of imagination and fantasy, but in the end, they might hint at\nsomething real. In 2003, archaeologists discovered human remains in a Flores\ncave. The remains, dubbed ', ',\nweren’t ordinary, though. They were small adults, very small in fact, at just\none meter tall. They were nicknamed hobbits, if that helps you picture them.\nSmall people, found in a cave near the Nage tribe of Flores. It seems like the\nstories were proving true. The trouble was the age of the remains. The oldest\nskeletons clocked in at around 38,000 years old, and the youngest at about\n13,000. In other words, if the Nage actually had attacked a tribe of tiny\npeople, it had happened a lot more than a handful of generations ago. Unless\nyou believe them, that is – in that case, the stories hint at something darker,\nthat the ', 'were in fact real,\nthat they might still inhabit the forests of Flores, and that ultimately, the\nstories were telling the truth. It sounds enticing. In fact, I think anyone\nwould be fascinated by such a notion. Unless, that is, these stories were about\nsomething in your own backyard. ', 'On the\nnight of April 21', ', 1977, a man named Billy Bartlett was driving through\nthe town of Dover, Massachusetts, with two of his friends. On Farm Street, they\nbegan to drive past a low, rough stone wall that was well-known to the locals.\nAs they did, Billy noticed movement at the edge of his vision, and turned to\nsee something on the wall unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was a\ncreature, with a body the size of a child’s, long, thin limbs, elongated\nfingers and an oversized, melon-shaped head. Billy claimed it was hairless, and\nthat the skin was textured. He even reported that it had large, orange-coloured\neyes. Billy later sketched a picture of the thing he had seen, and then added a\nnote to the bottom of the page: “I, Bill Bartlett, swear on a stack of Bibles\nthat I saw this creature”. A whole stack of Bibles, you say. Well, alright\nthen. Something like this probably happens every year – somewhere in the world,\nsomeone sees something weird, their mind twists their memories, and all of a sudden,\nthey think they encountered Abraham Lincoln in a hot tub. But Billy’s story had\nsome added credibility. You see, just two hours after he saw… whatever it was\nthat he saw, 15-year-old John Baxter was walking home from his girlfriend’s\nhouse, about a mile from Farm Street. He claimed that he saw something walking\ndown the street toward him. According to him, it was roughly the size and shape\nof a small child, and when the figure noticed him, though, it bolted for the\nwoods. John, being a highly intelligent teenager with powerful decision-making\nskills, decided that midnight was the perfect time to chase something strange\ninto the woods, and so he followed after it. What happened next was a literal,\nover-the-river-and-through-the-woods chase. When Baxter finally stopped to\ncatch his breath, though, he looked up to see that the creature was standing\nbeside a tree just a few yards away from him, watching him. That’s the moment\nwhen common sense took over, and John ran for his life. Later that night, he drew\na sketch of what he had seen. He also told the police about it. He described a\ncreature that had the body of a child, a large, oval-shaped head, thin arms and\nlegs and long fingers. On their own, each of these sightings could have been easily\ndismissed by the authorities, but together, they presented a powerful case.\nStill, any chance of their similarity being labelled a coincidence vanished\nless than 24 hours later. 15-year-old Abby Brabham and 18-year-old Will Taintor\nwere out for a drive on Springdale Avenue in Dover, when they saw something at\nthe side of the road, near a bridge. It was on all fours, but both of the claim\nthey got a very good look at it, and each of them described the creature as\nhairless and child-sized, with an overly large head and long, thin limbs. ', 'Three\nseparate events, spanning two nights, three unique sightings, yet one seemingly\nimpossible description, each captured in eerily similar sketches. There were small\ndiscrepancies regarding the colour of the creature’s eyes, but outside of that,\nthe consistency was astounding. Each of these eyewitnesses had seen something they\ncouldn’t explain, and each of them seemed to have observed the same thing. What\nI find most fascinating, though, is that nearly 30 years later, in 2006, the ', 'interviewed Billy Bartlett,\nand he’s never wavered from his story. He’s experienced embarrassment and ill treatment\nbecause of it over the years, of course, but though he’s clearly transformed\nfrom a teenager who saw something into a responsible, middle-aged adult, that\nmaturity hasn’t chased his testimony away, no matter how fantastical it might\nsound. They’ve called it the “Dover Demon” ever since that week in 1977. Others\nhave since come forward with similar sightings. One local man, Mark Sennott,\nsaid he had heard rumours in his high school in the early 70s of something odd\nin the woods. Sennott even claimed that he and some friends observed something\nodd near Channing Pond in 1972 that fits the description from these later\nreports. Channing Pond, mind you, is right beside Springdale Avenue, where\nTaintor and Brabham said they saw their Dover Demon. Clearly, something was in\nthose woods. Like most legends, this one will continue to cause debate and\nspeculation. There have been no more sightings since 1977, but even still, the\nDover Demon has left an indelible mark on the town and the surrounding area. ', 'It’s true,\nwe don’t like to be alone, but I think in the process of creating the stories\nthat have kept us company for centuries, humanity has also created convenient\nexcuses. All of these human-like creatures have acted as a sort of stand-in for\nhuman behaviour and accountability. In an effort to absolve ourselves from the\nhorrible things we’ve done, we seem to instinctively invent other beings on\nwhich we can set the blame. But what if the others really were there, long\nbefore we wove them into our stories? What if they were less an invention, and\nmore a co-opting of something we didn’t fully understand? Perhaps in our effort\nto shift the blame, we altered the source material a bit too much, and in doing\nso we buried the truth under a mountain of myth. There have been countless theories\nsurrounding the 1977 sightings in Dover. Some think it was a type of extra-terrestrial\nknown as a “grey”; others have actually suggested that it was just a baby\nmoose. I know, that does seem like an odd way to explain it – only two moose\nsightings were recorded in Massachusetts in 1977, and both of those were out in\nthe western part of the state, far from Dover. Add in the fact that a yearling\nmoose weighs more than 600lbs and I think that it’s clear that this theory just\nwon’t hold up. But there’s a different and more textured theory to consider. If\nyou remember, Billy Bartlett saw the Dover Demon sitting on an old stone wall\non Farm Street. Well, just beyond that wall is a large, stone outcropping that\nthe locals have always called “The Polka Stone”. Some think that the stone’s\nnickname is a mispronunciation of a different word, though. The original name,\nthey say, was the Pooka Stone. It could just be folklore, perhaps the tall\ntales of an early Irish settler, told to a group of children around the foot of\nan enormous rock. Unfortunately, we’ll never know for sure, but if you really\nwant to see for yourself, you’re always welcome to head over to Dover, and take\na drive down Farm Street. The wall, and the woods beyond, are still there, still\ndark, and still ominous. Just be careful if you travel there at night – you never\nknow what you might see at the edge of your headlights.

Sure, the clothes are outdated and the hair… oh my\ngosh, the hair. But aside from all the bits that didn’t age well, MacMullet and\nhis trusty pocket knife managed to capture my imagination forever. Part of it\nwas the adventure, part of it was the character of the man himself – I mean,\nthe guy was essentially a spy who hated guns, played hockey and lived on a\nhouseboat. But hovering above all those elements was the true core of the show.\nThis man could make anything if his life depended on it. As humans, we have\nthis innate drive inside ourselves to make things. This is how we managed to\ncreate things like the wheel, or stone tools and weapons. Our tendency towards\ntechnology pulled our ancient ancestors out of the Stone Age and into a more\ncivilised world. Maybe for some of us, ', '\nrepresented what we wanted to achieve: complete mastery of our own world. But\nlife is rarely that simple, and however hard we try to get our minds and hands\naround this world we want to rule, some things just slip through the cracks.\nAccidents happen. Ideas and concepts still allude our limited minds. We’re\nhuman, after all, not gods. So, when things go wrong, when our plans fall apart\nor our expectations fail to be met, we have this sense of pride that often\nrefuses to admit defeat. So, we blame others, and when that doesn’t work, we\nlook elsewhere for answers, and no realm holds more explanation for the\nunexplainable than folklore. 400 years ago, when women refused to follow the\nrules of society, they were labelled a witch. When Irish children failed to\nthrive it was because, of course, because they were a changeling. We’re good at\nexcuses. So, when our ancestors found something broken or out of place, there\nwas a very simple explanation – someone, or something, had tampered with it.\nI’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', 'The idea\nof meddlesome creatures isn’t new to us. All around the world, we can find\ncenturies-old folklore that speaks of creatures with a habit of getting in the\nway and making life difficult for humans. It’s an idea that seems to transcend\nborders and background, language and time. Some would say that it’s far too\ncoincidental for all these stories of mischief-causing creatures to emerge in\nplaces separated by thousands of miles and vast oceans. The ', 'of Ireland and the ', 'of Indonesia are great examples\nof this – legends that seem to have no reason for their eerie similarities.\nBoth legends speak of small, humanoid creatures that steal food and children,\nboth recommend not making them angry, and both describe their creatures as\nintrusive pranksters. To many, the evidence is just too indisputable to ignore.\nOthers would say it’s not coincidence at all, merely a product of human nature.\nWe want to believe there’s something out there causing the problems we\nexperience every day. So, of course, nearly every culture in the world has\ninvented a scapegoat. This scapegoat would have to be small to avoid discovery,\nand they need respect because we’re afraid of what they can do. To a cultural\nanthropologist, it’s nothing more than logical evolution. Many European\nfolktales include this universal archetype in the form of nature spirits, and\nmuch of it can be traced back to the idea of the ', '. ', 'It’s an\nold word and concept, coming to us from the Greeks. In essence, a ', 'is an otherworldly spirit that\ncauses trouble. The root word, ', 'literally\nmeans to cut or divide. In many ways, it’s an ancient version of an excuse. If\nyour horse was spooked while you were out for a ride, you’d probably blame it\non a ', '. Ancient Minoans believed\nin them, and in the day of the Greek poet Homer, people would blame their\nillnesses on them. The ', ', in\nmany ways, was fate. If it happened to you, there was a reason, and it was\nprobably one of these little things that caused it. But over time, the ', 'took on more and more names. Arab\nfolklore has the ', ', Romans spoke\nof a personal companion known as the ', ',\nin Japan, they tell tales of the ', ',\nand Germanic cultures mention ', '.\nThe stories and names might be unique to each culture, but the core of them all\nis the same. There’s something interfering with humanity, and we don’t like it.\n', 'For the\nmajority of the English-speaking world, the most common creature of this type\nin folklore, hands down, is the goblin. It’s not an ancient word, most likely\noriginating from the middle ages, but it’s the one that’s front and centre in\nmost of our minds, and from the start it’s been a creature associated with bad\nbehaviour. A legend from the 10', ' century tells of how the first\nCatholic bishop of Évreux in France faced a ', 'known to the locals there as ', '.\nWhy that name, though, is hard to trace. The best theory goes something like\nthis: there’s a Greek myth about a creature named ', ', who loved to trick and frighten people. That story\ninfluenced other cultures across Europe prior to Christianity’s spread,\ncreating the notion of the ', 'in\nancient Germany. That word was most likely to root of the word goblin. ', 'you can\npractically hear it evolve. The root word of ', 'is ', ', which\nliterally means “beneath the earth”, or “cavity in a rock”. We get the English\nword “cove” from the same root, and so naturally ', 'and their English counterparts, the goblins, are said to\nlive in caves underground, and if that reminds you of dwarves from fantasy\nliterature, you’re closer than you think. The physical appearance of goblins in\nfolklore vary greatly, but the common description is that they are dwarf-like\ncreatures. They cause trouble, are known to steal, and they have tendency to\nbreak things and make life difficult. Because of this, people in Europe would\nput carvings of goblins in their homes to ward off the real thing. In fact,\nhere’s something really crazy. Medieval door-knockers were often carved to\nresemble the faces of ', 'or\ngoblins, and it’s most likely purely coincidental, but in Welsh folklore,\ngoblins are called ', 'or more\ncommonly, knockers. My point is this: for thousands of years, people have\nsuspected that all of their misfortune could be blamed on small, meddlesome\ncreatures. They feared them, told stories about them, and tried their best to\nprotect their homes from them. But for all that time, they seemed like nothing\nmore than story. In the early 20', ' century, though, people started\nto report actual sightings, and not just anyone. These sightings were\ndocumented by trained, respected military heroes. Pilots. ', 'When the\nWright brothers took their first controlled flight in December of 1903, it\nseemed like a revelation. It’s hard to imagine it today, but there was a time\nwhen flight wasn’t assumed as a method of travel. So, when Wilbur spent three\nfull seconds in the air that day, he and his brother, Orville, did something\nelse: they changed the way we think about our world. And however long it took\nhumans to create and perfect the art of controllable, mechanical flight, once\nthe cat was out of the bag, it bolted into the future without ever looking\nback. Within just nine years, someone had managed to mount a machine gun onto\none of these primitive aeroplanes. Because of that, when the First World War\nbroke out just two years later, military combat had a new element. Of course,\nguns weren’t the only weapon a plane could utilise, though. The very first aeroplane\nbrought down in combat was an Austrian plane, which was literally rammed by a\nRussian pilot. Both pilots died after the wreckage plummeted to the ground\nbelow. It wasn’t the most efficient method of air combat, but it was a start.\nClearly, we’ve spent the many decades since getting very, very good at it.\nUnfortunately, though, there have been more reasons for combat disasters than\nmachine gun bullets and suicidal pilots, and one of the most unique and\nmysterious of those causes first appeared in British newspapers. In an article\nfrom the early 1900s, it was said that, and I quote, “the newly constituted\nroyal air force in 1918 appears to have detected the existence of a hoard of\nmysterious and malicious sprites, whose sole purpose in life was to bring about\nas many as possible of the inexplicable mishaps which, in those days as now,\ntrouble an airman’s life.” The description didn’t feature a name, but that was\nsoon to follow. Some experts think that we can find roots of it in the old\nEnglish word ', ', which means “to\nvex” or “to annoy”. It fits the behaviour of the creatures to the letter, and\nbecause of that they have been known from the beginning as gremlins.', 'Now,\nbefore we move forward, it might be helpful to take care of your memories of\nthe 1984 classic film by the same name. I grew up in the 80s, and ', 'was a fantastic bit of eye\ncandy for my young, horror-loving mind, but the truth of the legend has little\nresemblance to the version that you and I witnessed on the big screen. The\ngremlins of folklore, at least the stories that came out of the early 20', '\ncentury that is, describe the ancient stereotypical ', ', but with a twist. Yes, they were said to be small, ranging\nanywhere from six inches to three feet in height, and yes, they could appear\nand disappear at will, causing mischief and trouble wherever they went. But in\naddition, these modern versions of the legendary goblin seem to possess a\nsupernatural grasp of human technology. In 1923, a British pilot was flying\nover open water when his engine stalled. He miraculously survived the crash\ninto the sea and was rescued shortly after that. When he was safely aboard the\nrescue vessel, the pilot was quick to explain what had happened. Tiny\ncreatures, he claimed, had appeared on the plane. Whether they appeared out of\nnowhere or smuggled themselves aboard prior to take-off, the pilot wasn’t sure.\nHowever they got there, he said that they proceeded to tamper with the plane’s\nengine and flight controls, and without power or control, he was left to drop\nhelplessly into the sea. ', 'These\nreports were infrequent in the 1920s, but as the world moved into the Second\nWorld War and the number of planes in the sky began to grow exponentially, more\nand more stories seemed to follow – small, troublesome creatures who had an\nalmost supernatural ability to hold on to moving aircraft, and while they were\nthere, to do damage and to cause accidents. In some cases, they were even cited\ninside planes, among the crew and cargo. Stories, as we’ve seen so many times\nbefore, have a tendency to spread like disease. Oftentimes, that’s because of\nfear, but sometimes it’s because of truth, and the trouble is in figuring out where\nto draw that line, and that line kept moving as the sightings were reported\noutside the British ranks. Pilots on the German side also reported seeing\ncreatures during flights, as did some in India, Malta and the Middle East. Some\nmight chalk these stories up to hallucinations, or a bit of pre-flight\ndrinking. There are certainly a lot of stories of World War Two pilots climbing\ninto the cockpit after a night of romancing the bottle – and who can blame\nthem? In many cases, these pilots were going to their death, with a 20% chance\nof never coming back from a mission alive. But there are far too many reports\nto blame it all on drunkenness or delirium. Something unusual was happening to\nplanes all throughout the Second World War, and with folklore as a lens, some\nof the reports are downright eerie. In 2014, a 92-year-old World War Two\nveteran from Jonesborough, Arkansas came forward to tell a story he had kept to\nhimself for seven decades. He’d been a B-17 pilot during the war, one of the\nlegendary flying fortresses that helped allied air forces carry out successful\nmissions over Nazi territory, and it was on one of those missions that this man\nexperienced something that, until recently, he had kept to himself. The pilot,\nwho chose to identify himself with the initials L.W., spoke of how he was a\n22-year-old flight commander on the B-17, when something very unusual happened\non a combat mission in 1944. He described how, as he brought the aircraft to a\nhigher altitude, the plane began to make strange noises. That wasn’t completely\nunusual, as the B-17 is an absolutely enormous plane and sometimes turbulence can\nrattle the structure, but he checked his instrument panel out of habit.\nAccording to his story, the instruments seemed broken and confused. ', 'Looking\nfor an answer to the mystery, he glanced out the right-side window, and then\nfroze. There, outside the glass of the cockpit window, was the face of a small\ncreature. The pilot described it as about three feet tall with red eyes and\nsharp teeth. The ears, he said, were almost owl-like, and its skin was grey and\nhairless. He looked back toward the front and noticed a second creature, this\none moving along the nose of the aircraft. He said it was dancing and hammering\naway at the metal body of the plane. He immediately assumed he was\nhallucinating. I can picture him rubbing his eyes and blinking repeatedly like some\nold ', 'film. But according\nto him, he was as sharp and alert as ever. Whatever it was that he witnessed\noutside the body of the plane, he said that he managed to shake them off with a\nbit of “fancy flying”, and that’s his term, not mine. But while the creatures\nthemselves might have vanished, the memory of them would haunt him for the rest\nof his life. He told only one person afterwards, a gunner on another B-17, but\nrather than laugh at him his friend acknowledged that he, too, had seen similar\ncreatures on a flight just the day before.', 'Years\nprior, in the summer of 1939, an earlier encounter was reported, this time in\nthe Pacific. According to the account, a transport plane took off from the\nairbase in San Diego in the middle of the afternoon and headed toward Hawaii.\nOnboard were 13 marines, some of whom were crew of the plane and others were\npassengers – it was a transport, after all. About halfway through the flight,\nwhilst still over the vast expanse of the blue Pacific, the transport issued a\ndistress signal. After that, the signal stopped, as did all other forms of\ncommunication. It was as if the plane had simply gone silent and then vanished,\nwhich made it all the more surprising when it reappeared later, outside the San\nDiego airfield and prepared for landing. But the landing didn’t seem right. The\nplane came in too fast, it bounced on the runway in rough, haphazard ways, and\nthen finally came to a dramatic emergency stop. Crew on the runway immediately\nunderstood why, too – the exterior of the aircraft was extensively damaged,\nsome said it looked like bombs had ripped apart the metal skin of the\ntransport. It was a miracle, they said, that the thing even landed at all. When\nno one exited the plane to greet them, they opened it up themselves and stepped\ninside, only to be met with a scene of horror and chaos. ', 'Inside,\nthey discovered the bodies of 12 of the 13 passengers and crew. Each seemed to\nhave died from the same types of wounds, large, vicious cuts and injuries that\nalmost seemed to have originated from a wild animal. Added to that, the\ninterior of the transport smelled horribly of sulphur and the acrid odour of\nblood. To complicate matters, empty shell casings were found scattered about\nthe interior of the cockpit. The pistols responsible, belonging to the pilot\nand co-pilot, were found on the floor near their feet, completely spent. 12 men\nwere found, but there was a thirteenth. The co-pilot had managed to stay\nconscious despite his extensive injuries, just long enough to land the transport\nat the base. He was alive but unresponsive when they found him, and quickly\nremoved him for emergency medical care. Sadly, the man died a short while\nlater. He never had the chance to report what happened. ', 'Stories of\nthe gremlins have stuck around in the decades since, but they live mostly in\nthe past. Today they are mentioned more like a personified Murphy’s Law,\nmuttered as a humorous superstition by modern pilots. I get the feeling that\nthe persistence of the folklore is due more to its place as a cultural habit\nthan anything else. We can ponder why, I suppose. Why would sightings stop\nafter World War II? Some think it’s because of advancements in aeroplane\ntechnology: stronger structures, faster flight speeds, and higher altitudes.\nThe assumption is that, sure, gremlins could hold on to our planes, but maybe\nwe’ve gotten so fast that even that’s become impossible for them. The other\nanswer could just be that the world has left those childhood tales of little\ncreatures behind. We’ve moved beyond belief now. We’ve outgrown it. We know a\nlot more than we used to, after all, and to our thoroughly modern minds these\nstories of gremlins sound like just so much fantasy. Whatever reason you\nsubscribe to, it’s important to remember that many people have believed with\nall their being that gremlins are real, factual creatures, people we would\nrespect and believe. ', 'In 1927, a\npilot was over the Atlantic in a plane that, by today’s standards, would be\nconsidered primitive. He was alone, and he had been in the air for a very long\ntime but was startled to discover that there were creatures in the cockpit with\nhim. He described them as small, vaporous beings with a strange, otherworldly\nappearance. The pilot claimed that these creatures spoke to him and kept him\nalert in a moment when he was overly tired and passed the edge of exhaustion.\nThey helped with the navigation for his journey and even adjusted some of his\nequipment. This was a rare account of gremlins who were benevolent rather than\nmeddlesome or hostile. Even still, this pilot was so worried about what the\npublic might think of his experience that he kept the details to himself for\nover 25 years. In 1953, this pilot included the experience in a memoir of his\nflight. It was a historic journey, after all, and recording it properly\nrequired honesty and transparency. The book, you see, was called ', ', and the man was\nmore than just a pilot. He was a military officer, an explore, an inventor, and\non top of all of that he was also a national hero because of his successful\nflight from New York to Paris – the first man to do so, in fact. This man, of\ncourse, was Charles Lindbergh.', '[Closing\nStatements]']"

Feel free to point them out, but please be nice!', 'In March of 2014, a hiker in Lithuania stumbled upon a warm spring that was melting the ice on a frozen pond. It’s not unusual to find things like this, but he was curious. I would be too – the pond was frozen over, but there was a nice window into the still waters beneath. I have to think any one of us would have leaned in for a closer look. When he did, though, he witnessed something that his mind had trouble processing. It appeared to be a living creature, but it was unlike anything he had ever seen. Thankfully we live in a very connected, very digital age, and he used his phone to take a short video. I have no idea what the creature was, or if it even was a living thing at all, and I’m not going to discuss it today, or tell you more stories about similar sightings, because there aren’t any. It was a one off, a random occurrence that had never happened before, and would probably never happen again. Some stories are like that – sometimes we bump into something new, with no history or record of events to lend it pedigree or validity, and those stories frustrate me. Other stories, though, go deep. Some legends have been told for centuries. Some creatures have been sighted by hundreds of people over the years, and each new sighting lends credence to its story. And even if it’s all made up, or just one big misunderstanding, these layers upon layers of story seem to somehow give life to the creatures they describe. When we find these deep wells of folklore, our minds are presented with a challenge. Do the centuries of first-hand accounts serve as a proof, or do they highlight our incredible, cross-cultural, nearly genetic predisposition toward gullibility? Few places challenge us to such a degree as the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey. Inside that wooded expanse, mystery runs far and wide. Mystery, and some say, the devil. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '.', 'When we think of the east coast of the United States, we think of urban sprawl, of endless strings of bedroom communities, looping around massive metropolitan centres. New York City. Boston. Philadelphia. Washington DC. All of these places are symbols of humanity’s inability to leave an undeveloped area untouched. What most people don’t know, however, is that there is a huge expanse of forested land cutting through the southern part of New Jersey that simply boggles the mind. It’s called the Pine Barrens, and it’s the largest undeveloped area of land in the mid-Atlantic Seaboard. Seriously, this place is massive. There are 1.1 million acres of forest, and beneath it all are underground aquifers that are estimated to contain over 17 trillion gallons of the purest drinking water in the country. As you might imagine, such a massive area of untouched land comes with its own treasure chest of mythical creatures and frightening folklore. The local Lenape tribe of Native Americans tell stories of the ', ', the wood dwarves who live in the forest, a local version of the global “little people” legend. There are other creatures rumoured to exist in the pines, including “Big Red Eye”, the “Hoboken Monkey Man”, undocumented species of large cats, the “Cape May Sea Serpent”, the “Lizard Man of Great Meadows”, and something called a Kim Kardashian. New Jersey, you see, is full of monsters.', 'But hovering over them all like a patriarch, perched at the top of an ornate family tree, is something that has haunted the Pines for nearly 300 years. The original story goes something like this: in 1735, one Mrs. Shroud of Leeds Point, New Jersey, became pregnant with her 13', ' child. According to the legend, Mrs. Shroud secretly wished that this child would be a devil or demon child. Sure enough, when the child was born, it was misshapen and malformed. Mrs. Shroud kept the deformed child in her home, sheltered from the curious eyes of the community. But on a dark and stormy night, because bad things only ever happen on dark and stormy nights, of course, the child’s arms turned to wings and it escaped, flying up and out through the chimney. Mrs Shroud never saw her devil child again. That’s the story - or at least one version of it. A more prominent version of the legend identifies the mother as Mrs. Leeds, not a Mrs. Shroud from Leeds, who was from the Burlington area of New Jersey. Mrs. Leeds, according to the legend, had dabbled in witchcraft despite her Quaker beliefs, and this hobby of hers made the old women attending her birth more than a little uneasy. To their relief, though, a handsome baby boy was born that stormy night, and he was quickly delivered to Mrs. Leeds’ arms. That’s when he transformed. His human features vanished, his body elongated and even his skin changed. The baby’s head became horse-like, and hooves replaced his feet. Bat-like wings sprouted from his shoulders and he grew to the size of a man. Other stories have persisted through the centuries as well. One claimed that the monster was the result of a treasonous relationship between a colonial Leeds Point girl and a British soldier, while another story tells of a gypsy curse. There seems to have been no town or county in the Pines area without its own version of the story. Many of them vary wildly. But one thing united them all: the description of the creature. In all the stories it was some sort of hybrid or mutation of a normal animal. Most of the stories describe it in the same terms: head like a horse, wings like a bat, clawed hands, long serpent tail, and legs like a deer. In some accounts, the creature is almost dragon-like. Coincidentally, the Lenape tribe refers to the Pines area as ', ' which means “the place of the dragon”. Swedish explorers even named the area “Drake Kill”, ', 'being the Dutch word for river and ', 'meaning dragon. Whatever the truth is behind the origins behind this legend, and whatever its core features really are, the people of the Pines were united in what they called it: The Jersey Devil. And this devil was more than just a story that was passed from person to person. Over the centuries that followed, countless eyewitness reports surfaced that seemed to point to one overwhelming conclusion. The Jersey Devil… was real.', 'What makes the Jersey Devil so special is the quality of many of the sightings. Individuals with no need to make up stories, whether for political or professional reasons, all seem to have found the courage to report incidents that would normally be laughable. Stephen Decatur was a United States naval officer who was known for his many victories in the early 1800s. Decatur was, and still is today, a very well-respected figure in American history. There have been five warships named after him, he’s had his own stamp through the US postal service, and in the late 1800s, it was his face that graced the $20 bill rather than Andrew Jackson’s. According to the legend, Decatur visited the Hannover ironworks in Burlington, New Jersey in the early 1800s. The facility there manufactured cannonballs, something Decatur was very familiar with, and he had arrived to test some of the product. On this occasion, Decatur was said to have been on the firing range, operating the cannon. While there, he witnessed a strange creature flying overhead. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before and, like a true American, he aimed a cannon at it. He fired, and the shot was said to be true, striking the creature in mid-air. Mysteriously though, nothing happened. The creature continued on uninterrupted. Another early resident of New Jersey was Joseph Bonaparte, the brother of none other than Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon had appointed his brother King of Spain in 1808, but Joseph abdicated just five years later, before moving to the United States. He took up residence in a large estate called Breeze Point, near the Pine Barrens, and lived there for nearly two decades. One of his favourite past times was to go hunting in the Pines. On one of those hunting trips, the former King of Spain was in the woods near his home when he discovered some strange tracks in the snow. They looked like the tracks of a donkey but there were only two feet present, not four. Bonaparte commented on how one of the feet appeared slightly larger than the other, as if deformed in some way. He followed the tracks to a clearing, but stopped when the prints vanished. It was as if the animal had simply taken flight. As he was turning to leave, Bonaparte heard a strange hissing sound. He glanced back, only to find himself standing face to face with a large creature. He described it as having bat-like wings, the head of a horse, and it stood on thin hind legs. Before he could remember to use his rifle, the creature hissed one final time, flapped its wings, and flew off into the sky. He later described the events to a local friend, who simply smiled and congratulated the man. “You’ve just seen the famous Jersey Devil”, his friend told him.', 'The following decades were filled with more and more sightings and reports. In the early 1840s, a handful of farmers began to report the death of livestock on their land. In most cases, tracks were found but they could not be identified. Others claimed to have heard high-pitched screams in the Pines, a sound that would forever be connected with the Jersey Devil. By 1900, belief in the Jersey Devil was widespread and stronger than ever. Nearly everyone in the area believed that something otherworldly lived inside the Pines. Anytime disaster or death entered their lives, they cast blame on this creature, but some had also begun to do the math. If this creature really was the child of Mrs. Shroud and was born in 1735, then it was very, very old. Folklorist Charles B. Skinner commented on this in a 1903 publication. “It is said that its life has nearly run its course”, he wrote, “and with the advent of the new century many worshipful commoners of Jersey have dismissed, for good and all, the fear of the monster from their mind”. Skinner, you see, thought that it was gone - that the Jersey Devil was too old to carry on terrorising the people of the Pines. But when the events of 1909 unfolded, just six years later, one thing became very clear: Skinner couldn’t have been more wrong.', 'January 1909 was a busy month for thpe Jersey Devil. In the early morning hours of January 16', ', a man named Thack Cozzens was out for a walk under the stars in Woodbury, New Jersey. A sound caught his attention, and he glanced up, only to see a large, dark shape fly past. Cozzens recalled noticing that the creature’s eye glowed bright red. 26 miles away that same early morning, in the town of Bristol, Pennsylvania, a number of people reported seeing a similar creature. One eyewitness, a police officer named James Sackville, actually fired his handgun at it, without effect. E. W. Minster, the town postmaster, also saw the flying thing, and according to him, it also unleashed a high-pitched scream. When the sun rose that morning, several people reported finding strange hoof prints in the snow. No one could identify the kind of creature who would leave such tracks. And just one day later, on the 17', ', unusual hoof prints were found in the snow outside the home of the Lowdens in Burlington, New Jersey. The tracks surrounded their trashcan, which had been knocked over and rummaged through. Other people found tracks on their rooftops. Trails were followed into streets, where the tracks would simply vanish. The Burlington police tried tracking the creature with the help of hunting dogs, but the dogs refused to follow the trails. At 2:30 in the morning on Tuesday the 19', ', a Mr. and Mrs. Evans were asleep in bed in Gloucester, New Jersey, when a scream awoke them. They both climbed out of bed and approached their window, and then stopped, paralysed by fear. There on the roof of their shed stood a creature unlike anything they had ever laid eyes on. According to Mr. Evans, it was roughly 3ft tall and had the head of a horse. It walked on two legs and held smaller, claw-like hands against its chest. The leathery wings were still present, as was the long, serpentine tail. The couple managed to frighten the creature away after watching it for nearly 10 minutes. Later that day, professional hunters were called in to attempt to track the creature, but they had no success. The following day brought more of the same. A Burlington police officer was the first to see the creature, followed by a local minister. A hunting party that was formed to track the beast claimed they watched it fly towards Moorestown, and in Moorestown, it was seen at Mount Carmel Cemetery. From there, it was seen to fly toward Riverside, and there, hoof prints were found in a cluster around a dead puppy. A day later, an entire trolley full of passengers in Clementon watched a winged creature circle above them. The Black Hawk Social Club reported their own sighting, and when a Collingswood fireman saw one up close, he turned his hose on the creature, chasing it off. Later that night, a woman named Mrs. Sorbinski of Camden heard a noise outside in the dark. She grabbed her broom and stepped out, only to find the mysterious beast trying to catch her dog. Mrs. Sorbinski beat at the creature with her broom until it released the dog and flew away. When a crowd gathered as a result of her screaming, they all claimed to see the creature off in the distance. The mob charged toward the thing, then a police officer even fired shots, but whatever the creature was, it had managed to escape into the sky. The creature made a few more random appearances across New Jersey during late January of that year, but it was one final sighting in February that leaves many questions to be answered. An employee of a local electric railroad was out working on the tracks when he saw what he later described as the Jersey Devil flying overhead. He claimed to have watched the creature fly into one of the overhead electrical wires, generating an explosion large enough to melt the metal tracks directly underneath. A search was made, but no body was found.', 'Maybe the stories of the Jersey Devil are about something else. Maybe they’re really about fear - fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, a fear of what might be lurking out there in the trees. Humanity has feared these things for millennia, but perhaps the people of the Pines feared something more basic, more fundamental than whatever might be waiting for them in the darkness. Perhaps they simply feared being alone. There’s nothing worse than experiencing a loss you can’t seem to explain, or noises you can’t identify, especially if you are in a new and strange place. The sources might very well be real and normal, but in the setting and culture of their day, the unexplainable only served to highlight the loneliness of the early settlers of New Jersey. The Barrens had a way of giving permission to fear the unknown. They still do to this day. When settlers discovered rare or unusual plants and animals inside these woods, it became easy to take it one step further. Demon children, creatures dancing on rooftops, livestock and pets being attacked – we explain our existence with fantasy, because sometimes that’s the only thing that can help us cope. In 1957, some employees from the New Jersey Department of Conservation found a partial animal corpse in the Pines. It was a mangled collection of feathers, mammal bones ad long hind legs that appeared to have been burnt or scorched. It might be logical to assume that the creature that flew into the electrical wires in 1909 had literally crashed and burnt, only to be discovered decades later. It might, in fact, sound like the creature was gone for good. But in 1987, an unidentified woman in Vinland, New Jersey, reported that her German Shepherd had been killed during the night. The dog had been torn to pieces and dragged over 25ft from the end of its chain. The only evidence the authorities could find around the body were hoof prints.', 'This episode of ', 'was produced by me, Aaron Mahnke.

Growing up in the\nChicago area, I was always aware of how long the Cubs had gone without winning a\nWorld Series title. It was less a point of pain, and more a numb spot in the\ncollective conscience of everyone around me. When I moved to Boston in the late\n90s, I discovered a similar culture, this time centred around the Red Sox.\nAgain, here was a team that had spent decades waiting; year after year, hope\nwould be manufactured, and piled high in the cart of expectations, only to have\nthat cart dumped on its side at the end of each season. Until 2004, that is –\nthat was the year things changed. That was the year that brought the tower of\nhopelessness and doubt, a tower that took 86 years to construct – brick by brick,\nyear after year – and brought it all crashing down. The wait was over. No, I don’t\nplan to talk about baseball today, but I do think the story of these teams,\nlike the Cubs and the Red Sox, have something valuable to teach us about how\nour minds work, our ability to justify, to explain, to make sense of what seems\nso often to not make any sense at all; that’s what I find fascinating. Humans\nare so very good at finding reasons. Lurking behind the Red Sox’ 86 year wait like\na shadow, and still hovering over the Cubs after 107 long years, are the excuses\n- more specifically, the curses. I mean, how else are we to explain such droughts,\nsuch logic-defying gaps in their score cards. Of course, both of these teams\nhad to be cursed… right? But the bambino and billy-goat weren’t the first\ncurses in history, and they were far from the last, and while some curses have\nbeen entertaining or even laughable, others have defied explanation long enough\nto make people wonder. In fact, some have even been deadly. I’m Aaron Mahnke,\nand this is ', '. ', 'The word “curse”\ncomes from the Old English word ', ' -\njust drop the “e” and you’ll have the root. The meaning isn’t actually very\nclear, but one of the uses of the Old English word is to denote a path or a route.\nNow, I’m not etymologist, but I think the word picture here is actually pretty\nclear: life is like a journey, sometimes we walk along the path of our\nchoosing, and sometimes we’re pushed off and into the woods. It’s in those\nmoments of chaos, of the unexpected and the unfortunate, that we feel like we’ve\nlost control. It’s as if someone, or something, has knocked us off the path we\nwere travelling. In those moments, it might be appropriate to say that we’ve\nbeen cursed. The curse as a concept, though, has been around since the\nbeginning of humanity. In the earliest examples, a curse was a punishment, handed\nout by a deity to misbehaving or devious human beings. The story of Adam and\nEve in the Christian Bible is full of curses, dolled out after their disobedience\nto God’s instructions: hard physical work, painful childbirth, and expulsion\nfrom paradise are all described as curses. The Irish speak of curses as if they\nwere something like birds. Once a curse is spoken aloud, they say it can float\naround a place until it finds its intended target. If the receiver wasn’t in\nthe room, a curse could drift around for up to seven years. Not aimlessly, though\n– the curse was like a heat-seeking missile, waiting until the moment when the\nperson would arrive. In Scandinavia, curses were more like bullets. A person\nmight utter a curse at an enemy, but it could be turned back or returned to the\nspeaker, where it would deal the effects of the curse on the speaker instead.\nThink Harry Potter wand duels, if you will. The Moors of the middle ages also\nhad a very interesting tradition involving curses: it was said that if a man\nfollowed a prescribed set of rules and requirements, he was allowed to ask\nothers to help him with something important. If, after jumping through all of\nthe correct hoops, his request was still refused, a curse was said to descend\nupon all who refused him. Not a specific curse that he made up himself, but a\ngeneral, social curse, as if tradition itself were punishing the unhelpful\npeople. According to legend, the Celtic people of Europe used curses in a\npowerful way. If a tenant farmer was fired and evicted from the land that he\nhad been working, he would quickly go and gather stones from all over the property.\nThen, he would put those stones in a lit fireplace, fall on his knees, and\npray. What did he pray for, exactly? Well, they prayed that for as long as the\nstones remained unburnt, every possible curse would descend upon their landlords,\nhis children, and all the generations after them. Then, rather than leaving the\nstones in the fireplace, where they could eventually become burnt, thus ending\nthe curses, they would gather them up and scatter them all across the countryside.\nCurses have been there since the beginning, it seems, but over time, they have\nevolved to be more than just something you do to another person, as if they\nwere weapons. Many of the stories that we tell on dark nights around campfires\nhave more to do with the implications. You see, sometimes the horrible tragedies\nof life refuse to be explained away without the mention of a deadly curse. ', 'When\nPrince Amedeo of Savoy told his father in 1867 that he planned to marry Maria\nVittoria dal Pozzo, his father was enraged. Sure, she was of noble birth, but\nshe was no princess, and she certainly wasn’t worthy of the son of a king. He\nwas said to have cursed their union. On the morning of their wedding, Maria’s dressmaker\ncommitted suicide. Maria took the hint and found a different dress to wear.\nLater, as the bridal party made their way to the palace church in a grand procession,\none of the military leaders fell of his horse and died right there, in the\nstreet. The wedding procession continued on, though, and finally reached the\npalace gates, only to find them shut. A quick inspection revealed the reason\nwhy: the gatekeeper was found in the gatehouse, lying in a pool of his own\nblood. The death toll continued, though. Immediately after the wedding, the\nbest man shot himself in the head. The wedding party headed to the train\nstation, perhaps in an effort to outrun the curse, but when they arrived, the\nman who had drafted their marriage contract had a brain haemorrhage and died on\nthe spot. He was soon followed by the station master, who somehow got pulled\nunder the royal train carriage, and was crushed to death. The king apparently\nsaw a pattern and recalled the entire party to the palace. While they were\nleaving the train, though, one of the nobleman fell beneath the same train car.\nA medallion on his chest, most likely a gift from the king, was pushed through\nhis skin, stabbing him in the heart. Maria was the final victim of the curse,\nthey say. She died in childbirth at the age of 29. ', 'Timur the\nLame, or Tamerlane as he was known, was the great-great-grandson of Genghis Khan,\ntaking the throne in 1369. He was a vicious Mongol warlord and was known for his\nbloody military campaigns. He often built pyramids after his victories – not with\nstone, mind you. No, he preferred to use the heads of the defeated army,\nsometimes tens of thousands of them. He died in 1405, and I imagine more than a\nfew people were elated at the news. He was buried in an area that we now know\nas Uzbekistan, and a large, jade slab was placed over his tomb as a safeguard.\nThe stone was inscribed with a word of warning: “When I arise from the grave”,\nit said, “the world will tremble”. Some reports say that another message\nreferred to a great battle that would be unleashed should his grave ever be\ndisturbed. You see where this is going, right? In 1941, Joseph Stalin sent a\nteam of Soviet archaeologists to look for Timur’s tomb. When the local Uzbek\nelders heard of the search and planned excavation, they spoke out in protest.\nThey made reference to an old book that made it clear just how bad of an idea\nit was to open the tomb. They spoke of a curse. They spoke, but no one\nlistened. On June 21', ', 1941, the tomb of Tamerlane was opened, and\nhis skull was removed. The very next day, Hitler’s forces crossed into the\nSoviet Union, beginning the largest German military operation of World War II.\nIn fact, if the Second World War had a great battle, this was it, hands down. The\nbody of Tamerlane was studied for over a year while the Soviet Union was torn\napart and destroyed by Hitler’s army. All told, the Soviet Union lost 26.6\nmillion men and women to the invasion, more than any country in human history.\nIt’s unclear why, but in November of 1942, the Soviets decided to return Timur’s\nbody to the tomb, complete with a proper, Islamic burial. Days later, the\nGerman invasion was repelled at Stalingrad, finally pushing them back to the West,\nand marking a turning point in the war. A turning point, some say, that was caused\nby the curse. ', 'The idea\nof the curse is common throughout folklore, and many popular stories use it as\na plot device: the cursed spinning wheel of Sleeping Beauty, Snow White’s\ncursed apple, and the cursed brothers of the seven ravens all come to mind. But\nthere’s another example in Irish tradition that tops them all, however obscure\nit might be. There’s an ancient Norse work called the King’s Mirror that tells\na fascinating story about St. Patrick. Patrick, of course, was known for his\nwork spreading Christianity throughout Ireland in the 5', ' century,\nbut he apparently did not always meet with success on his travels. According to\nthe account, St. Patrick once visited a clan that lived in the southern kingdom\nof Ireland called Ossory. Like any other visit, Patrick’s mission was to bring\nhis message of Christianity to the people there, but it appears that he struck\nout. The ', 'goes on to\ndescribe how the people of the clan made every effort they could to insult both\nPatrick and the God he represented. Patrick, to his credit, carried on and\ntried his best. He preached the same message he always did, and followed the\nsame protocol, meeting with the clan in their place of assembly, but the people\nwouldn’t hear him out. Instead, they did something that might seem incredibly\nodd to our modern ears: they howled like wolves. It’s not that they laughed at\nhim, and it happened to sound like howling; these people literally howled at\nSt. Patrick. The reason was incredibly logical. The totem, or spirit animal for\nthis clan, happened to be the wolf. To them, they were just responding to the\nmessage of an outside deity with the sounds of their own. Now, this was pretty\nunheard of for St. Patrick, and the fact that this event was recorded in a\nNorse history book highlights just how unusual it was. But even more unusual\nwas Patrick’s response to this stubborn, insulting clan. Clearly upset, Patrick\nstopped speaking, and began to pray. It was said that he asked God to punish\nthe people of the village for their stubbornness. He wasn’t specific, but he\nasked for some form of affliction that would be communal, that would carry on,\nthrough the generations, as a constant reminder of their disobedience.\nAccording to the story, God actually listened. It was said that the people of\nOssory were forever cursed to become the very thing they worshipped - wolves. But\nthis curse followed a very specific set of rules: every seven years, one couple\nfrom the village of Ossory would be transformed into a wolf. They would be\nstuck in this form day and night, year after year, until the next couple would\ntake over, transforming into wolves themselves. Part of the curse was said to\nbe how the people of Ossory maintained their human minds while in the form of a\nwolf. But although they thought and spoke as humans, they were equally bound to\nthe cravings of their new form; specifically, the craving for human flesh. In\nthis way, the curse affected everyone, from the man and woman transformed, to\nthe people around them who lived in constant fear of being attacked. Ever since\nthat day, so the legend goes, the people of Ossory have been cursed. ', 'There’s\nmedia hype, and then there’s grasping at straws. For some people, declaring\nsomeone or something to be cursed adds an air of mystery and drama. It’s the sexy\nbit, and sex sells, right? For example, the Kennedy family story is sad and\ntragic, but when we add a dash of curse, we elevate it to near mythic\nproportions. Other people, though, really do believe. Either they’ve\nexperienced the sting of unexplainable misfortune, or they’ve watched the lives\nof people around them crumble for no discernible reason. The human mind wants\nanswers, it demands them, it seeks them out. People love story, but only the\nones with closure, and that’s what curses offer us. At the end of the day,\ncurses help us make sense of a thing, or person, or place, that seems to be\nhaunted by misfortune. They act like a walking stick for people having a\ndifficult time staying on the path. They help us make sense of life. I can\nimagine life in the 6', ' century in Ireland was incredibly difficult,\nand it would make sense that, eventually, someone would begin to tell stories\nthat tried to explain the harshness of that life, stories about a curse,\nperhaps. When someone failed to return from battle or a hunting trip, or even\ntravel between two villages, it was hard to not have all the answers. Stories\nabout attacks from local werewolves certainly did their part in explaining\nthese disappearances. But they were just stories, right? Gerald of Wales was a\n12', ' century historian who recorded something interesting. He had been\nsent to Ireland by King Henry II to record the local history there. According\nto him, a local priest requested his company while he was visiting. This priest\nsat down and told Gerald an amazing tale. According to the report, he had been\ntravelling near the western border of county Meath, close to what would have\nbeen ancient Ossory, and had camped for the night in the woods. That night,\nwith his fire burning low, someone approached him from the darkness beyond the\nfirelight, and spoke. Obviously, the priest was frightened – he thought that he\nhad been alone, but the voice of a man called out to him with great urgency.\nThe man spoke of his wife, who was sick at home. He was worried, and wondered\nif this man of God might come, and at least perform last rights for her. Reluctantly,\nthe priest agreed. He gathered up his belongings and followed the voice into\nthe woods. They travelled a short distance, until they came to a large, hollow\ntree. There, the priest noticed two frightening things. First, there was\nsomething, or someone, lying inside the tree, presumably the sick wife. Second,\nthough, he realised that the voice was not coming from a man at all, but a\nwolf. He was taken aback. How, he asked the wolf, was he able to speak like a\nman? The wolf’s answer was simple: centuries before, he said, his people had\nbeen cursed by a travelling priest, forever doomed to become wolves. The priest\nprayed over the man’s wife, he tended her illness, and the couple was gone by\nmorning, never to be seen again. ', 'This episode\nof ', 'was produced by me, Aaron\nMahnke.

They seem to cut us off from the rest of the world, leaving us alone, balanced on the edge of being lost. Even in these fairly modern times, the woods seem to exist as a reminder that so much of the world is outside of our control. Sure, we could stay on the path, but those narrow routes between the trees only give us the illusion of control, like a trail of breadcrumbs. They’re fragile and fleeting, and somewhere in the back of our minds we understand that if we were to leave the trail, we would be stepping into the unknown. The woods hide things from us. For centuries, criminals have used the dark cloak of the forest to conceal everything from bootlegging and poaching to drug use and murder. They hide wildlife from us and instil just enough doubt and mystery that we end up believing anything could be living out there. Anything. Some areas, though, are darker than others. In some places the woods are more than just a gathering of trees and undergrowth. There are locations in our world that are consistently avoided, plagued by rumour, and dense with fear. To step into one of these places is to abandon all safety, all reason, and all hope. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '.', 'Between the three Massachusetts towns of Abington, Rehoboth and Freetown exists a triangular slice of land that has become home to hundreds of reports of unexplainable phenomenon. It’s known as the Bridgewater Triangle, though some call it the black triangle, or the devil’s triangle. It might not be swallowing up fighter jets and colonial era ships like the Bermuda Triangle to the south, but its history is just as storied and mysterious. One of the areas within the triangle is the Hockomock Swamp. It’s a 17,000-acre wetland near Bridgewater, Massachusetts. In the 1600s it was inhabited by the Wampanoag tribe of Native Americans, and the fort they built inside it became a strategic location for them during King Philip’s war in 1674. One legend tells how during those times of upheaval and invasion by the colonies, a powerful artefact was lost in the swamp. Now, I can’t find anything beyond a small Wikipedia entry to confirm this, but the story tells of how an object known as the Wampum belt was lost during the war, and that as a result, the swamp became a home to restless spirits. Ever since, the swamp has been a source of a nearly endless supply of unexplainable sightings. One of the most dramatic and best documented reports was made by a local police officer, Sargent Thomas Downey. On a summer night in 1971, Downey was driving home towards the town of Easton, near a place known as Bird Hill, that sits at the edge of the swamp. As he approached the hill, he caught sight of an enormous, winged creature. Downey claims it was over 6ft tall and had a wingspan of almost 12ft. After reporting the sighting to the Easton police, he quickly earned the nickname of “The Bird Man”. I don’t know about you, but it seems odd that a police officer would risk his reputation on such an unusual claim if it was just a joke. Officer Downey clearly saw something that night – just what that thing was, though, is open to debate.', 'Decades earlier, in 1939, the Civilian Conservation Corps were working on the edge of the swamp, near King Philip’s Street. While there, workers claim to have seen a huge snake, as large around and as black as a stovepipe. According to the report, the snake coiled for a moment, raised its head, and then vanished into the swamp. And what wooded area would be complete without Bigfoot sightings? Although a tall, hairy creature has been sighted dozens of times over the years in various parts of the Bridgewater Triangle, the most common experiences have been near the swamp. In 1983, John Baker, a local fur trapper, had a similar experience. He was on his canoe in the swamp when he heard a splash. He turned to see, and I quote, “a hairy beast slog into the river, and pass within a few yards of his boat”. In 1978, a local man, Joe DeAndrade, was standing on the shore of a pond known as Clay Banks. He claimed that he turned and saw what he described as “a creature that was all brown and hairy, like an apish man-thing”. Oddly enough, I went to high school with a guy who fits that description. But there’s been more than just weird animal sightings in the swamp. As far back as the late 19', ' century, locals have reported seeing unusual lights. One report was made by two undertakers who were travelling past the swamp on Halloween night in 1908. They claim to have seen a light that hovered in the sky for almost an hour. Whether the reports of creatures and lights are true or not, it might be worth mentioning that the Wampanoag word ', 'literally means “the place where the spirits dwell”.', 'Another hotspot, in the south-eastern corner of the triangle, is the Freetown State Forest. If all the stories are to be believed, it’s the quintessential haunted forest. Deep inside the park is a cliff, known as the Assonet Ledge, that overlooks an old quarry. There have been reports of hauntings near the ledge, of visions and ghostly figures. Some stories tell [of how] a woman in white lingers near the precipice. Others claim to have heard voices while visiting there. The most common report is of mysterious lights. Some researchers think they know exactly where those lights come from, too. They’re the tools of a creature known as the “Pukwudgie”. In ancient Wampanoag folklore, the Pukwudgie is a small, forest-dwelling creature, something like a troll or a goblin, that lives in the wooded areas around the swamp. Aside from having one of the most entertaining names to say out loud, they are sawid to be small, hairy people, roughly 3ft tall, who hide in the woods and cause trouble to people who discover them. What kind of trouble? Well, Wampanoag folklore tells of how the Pukwudgies use lights to lure travellers into the woods, where they would kill them. These lights, according to legend, are known as the “tei pai wankas”, the North American version of the English will-o’-the-wisp, sometimes referred to as ghost lights. The pukwudgies use the lights as bait, luring people to their death. Rather than attacking hikers outright, apparently these creatures prefer to let the land itself kill their victims. Coincidentally, one of the most common experiences reported by visitors to the ledge is an overwhelming urge to jump. Normal, healthy people have felt nearly suicidal standing atop the ledge. Many of them claim, upon approaching the edge of the cliff, they felt an almost uncontrollable desire to jump off into the dark, rocky water, over 100ft below.', 'One story in particular bares retelling. Bill Russo was a welder from Raynham. He worked long hours, and for the six years prior to his retirement, he worked the late shift, from 3pm until midnight. By the time he got home from work each night, Bill’s dog Samantha was in desperate need of a walk, and so before bed, Bill would take her out and let her get some exercise. They kept this habit up each and every night, no matter the season or the weather. On a night in 1995, Bill took Samantha out for their usual walk. Their typical route was to stay on the sidewalks and head toward the centre of town, but on this night, they made a change. Bill decided, on a whim, to cut through his own backyard and head along a trail through the woods that ran alongside the swamp. Not a choice I would have made, mind you, even with a German shepherd and rottweiler mix as my companion. About half a mile into their walk, at a place where the path was crossed by a road, Samantha began acting odd. She was tugging at the leash and trembling, and kept glancing back at Bill with worried eyes. Bill pulled at the leash to lead her home, but the dog wouldn’t budge, she just whined and quivered where she stood. After a moment, Bill began to hear the sound that had frightened his dog. It was a thin, high-pitched voice, faint at first but growing louder as it continued, and even though Bill couldn’t understand what the voice was saying, it kept repeating the same sounds. “Ee wahn chu” it seemed to say, “ee wahn chu”. It was midnight, in the woods, so of course Bill couldn’t see anything, but he tried – he scanned the trees and bushes for whatever could be making the sounds. There was even a street light nearby, casting a small circle of pale light on the pavement, but he didn’t see anything. And then suddenly something stepped into the light.', 'According to Bill, it was perhaps 4ft tall, covered in hair, walked on two legs like a human, and looked to weigh no more than 100lb. It was naked and potbellied, and looked nothing like anything Bill had ever seen before in the swamp. And as it stepped out of the trees and into the light, it continued to speak to him. “Ee wahn chu” it said again. “Keer, keer”. Bill and Samantha stood frozen to the ground, paralysed with fear, and as the dog continued to whine and shiver, the creature lifted its arms and beckoned them to follow. “Ee wahn chu” it said again, motioning to them, “keer”. Bill claimed that he tried asking the creature a few questions, but it only replied with the same nonsense it had already said. Not knowing what else to do, Bill managed to tug Samantha after him, and they both turned and headed home. They didn’t look back.', 'It’s not the trees that make the woods a frightening place, it’s what the trees conceal. There’s no telling what creatures hide behind the green leaves and thick branches of the forest landscape. Cryptozoologists, ghost hunters and believers in the supernatural are often seen as abnormal. They believe in things that can’t possibly be real. But when we step into the woods, when we surround ourselves with the dark embrace of the unknown, somehow the impossible begins to seem more likely. Maybe we want to believe. Maybe that feeling we get in the pit of our stomachs when we step into a strange, wooded area, is a cry for answers. There has to be something more out there, right? Maybe that’s all we want to know, but we’re simply too afraid of the answers. Bill Russo experienced that same fear on that night in 1995. He and Samantha managed to find their way home, but he was beyond shaken up. Even though it was 1 o’clock in the morning, he went into the kitchen and brewed himself a pot of coffee. There was no way he was going to let himself sleep that night. Cup after cup, hour after hour, Bill relived the experience over and over again, playing back everything he heard and saw. He experienced doubt, and fear, and regret. He wondered if maybe he should have tried harder to speak with the creature. Perhaps he should have approached it, if Samantha would have allowed him to, that is. But the question that plagued him for most of that night was more difficult. What was the creature saying to him? Bill wrestled with his memory of those sounds all through the night. “Ee wahn chu”, it said, and then “Keer”. Before sunrise, Bill was almost positive that he had his answer. It wasn’t another language the creature was speaking after all. It had been trying its best to use English – and the words it kept repeating? “We want you”, it had been saying, “come here”.', 'is a biweekly podcast and was produced by me, Aaron Mahnke.

They’ll respond with something that sounds incredibly like folklore and myth. The full moon has the power to bring out the crazy in people. We’ve believed this for a long time. We refer to unstable people as “lunatics”, a word that is Latin. It’s built from the root word ', ', which means “moon”. And for centuries, has operated under the conviction that changes in the luna cycle can cause people to lose touch with reality. Just ask the parents of a young child and they’ll tell you tales of wild behaviour and out-of-the-ordinary disobedience at certain times of the month. Science tells us that just as the moon’s pull on the ocean creates tides that rise and fall in severity, so too does our planet’s first satellite tug on the water inside our bodies, changing our behaviour. As modern people, when we talk about the full moon we tend to joke about this insane, extraordinary behaviour. But maybe we joke to avoid the deeper truth, an idea that we are both frightened and embarrassed that we even entertain. For most of us, you see, the full moon conjures up an image that is altogether unnatural and unbelievable. That large, glowing, perfect circle in the night sky makes us think of just one thing: werewolves. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', 'Science has tried many times over the years to explain our obsession with the werewolf. One theory is a disease known as hypertrichosis, sometimes known as “wolfitis”. It’s a condition of excessive, unusual body hair growth, oftentimes covering the person’s entire face. Think Michael J. Fox in ', '. Psychologists actually have an official diagnosis in the DSM IV handbook known as “clinical lycanthropy”. It’s defined as a delusional syndrome where the patient believes they can transform into an animal, but the changes only take place in their mind, of course. Delusions, though, have to start somewhere. Patients who believe that they are Napoleon Bonaparte have some previous knowledge of who he was. I think it’s fair to assume that those who suffer from clinical lycanthropy have heard of werewolves before. It’s actually pretty easy to bump into the myth, thanks to modern popular culture. Werewolves have been featured in, or at least appeared in, close to 100 films in Hollywood since 1913.', 'One of the earliest mentions of something even resembling the modern werewolf can actually be found in the 2000-year-old writings of the Roman poet Vergil. In his ', ', written about 40BCE, he described a man named Moeris, who could transform himself into a wolf using herbs and poisons. About 50 years later, Gaius Petronius wrote a satirical novel called, appropriately, ', ', which I think is basically the equivalent of Stephen King writing a horror novel called “Frighticon”. In it, he tells the tale of a man named Niceros. In the story, Niceros was travelling with a friend, and when that friend suddenly took off his clothes, urinated in a circle and transformed into a wolf right before his eyes, before running off toward a large field of sheep. The next day, Niceros was told by the sheep-owner that one of the shepherds stabbed a wolf in the neck with a pitch fork. Later that day, Niceros noticed that his friend, now returned to the house, had a similar wound on his neck.', 'In the Greek myth of the god Zeus and an Arcadian king named Lycaon, Zeus took on the form of a human traveller. At one point in his journey he visited Arcadia, and during his time in that country, he visited the royal court. The king of the land, Lycaon, somehow recognised Zeus for who he truly was and tried, in true Greek form, of course, to kill him by serving him a meal of human flesh. But Zeus was a smart guy, after all, and he caught Lycaon in the act, throwing the mythological equivalent of a temper tantrum. He destroyed the palace, killed all 50 of the king’s sons with lightning bolts, and then of course cursed King Lycaon himself. The punishment? Lycaon would be doomed to spend the rest of his life as a wolf, presumably because wolves were known for attacking and eating humans, and he tried to serve human flesh. Most scholars believe that this legend is what gives birth to the term lycanthropy: ', 'being the Greek word for wolf, and ', ', the word for man.', 'Werewolves aren’t just a Greco-Roman thing. In the 13', ' century, the Norse recorded their mythological origins in something called the ', '. Despite their culture being separated from the Greeks by thousands of miles and many centuries, there are in fact tales of werewolves present in their histories. One of the stories in the ', ' involves a father and son pair: Sigmund and Sinfjotli. During their travels, the two men came across a hut in the woods where they found two enchanted wolf skins. These skins had the power to change the wearer into a wolf, giving them all the characteristics that the beast was known for: power, speed, and cunning. The catch, according to the saga, was that once put on, the wolf pelt could only be taken off every 10 days. Undeterred, the father son duo each put on one of the wolf skins, and transform into the beasts. They decided to split up and go hunting in their new forms, but they made an arrangement that if either of them encountered a party of men over the certain size of seven, then they were supposed to howl for the other to come join them in the hunt. Sigmund’s son, however, broke his promise, killing off a hunting party of 11 men. When Sigmund discovered this, he fatally injured his son. After the god Odin intervened and healed him, both men took off the pelts and burned them. You see, from the very beginning, werewolves were a supernatural thing, a curse, a change in the very nature of humanity. They were ruled by cycles of time and feared by those around them.', 'Things get interesting when we go to Germany. In 1582, the country of Germany was being pulled apart by a war between Catholics and Protestants, and one of the towns that played host to both sides was the small town of Bedburg. Keep in mind that there were also still outbreaks of the Black Death, so this was an age of conflict and violence. People understood loss – they had become numb to it, and it would take something incredibly extraordinary to surprise them. First, there were cattle mutilations: farmers from the area surrounding Bedburg would find dead cattle in their fields. It started of infrequent, but grew to become a daily occurrence, something that went on for weeks. Cows that had been sent out to pasture were found torn apart. It was as if a wild animal had attacked them. Naturally, the farmers assumed it was wolves, but it didn’t stop there. Children began to go missing. Young women vanished from the main roads around Bedburg. In some cases their bodies were never found, but those that were had been mauled by something horribly violent. Finding your cattle disembowelled is one thing, but when it’s your daughter or your wife, well, it can cause panic, and fear, and so the community spiralled into hysteria.', 'Now, we think of historical European paranoia and we often think of witchcraft. The 15', ' and 16', ' centuries were filled with witch hunts: burnings, hangings, and an overwhelming hysteria that even spread across the Atlantic to the British colonies, where it destroyed more lives. The Witch Trails of Salem, Massachusetts are the most famous of those examples, but at the same time, Europe was also on fire with fear of werewolves. Some historians think that in France alone, some 30,000 people were accused of being werewolves, and some (hundreds, they say) were even executed for it, either by hanging or being burnt at the stake. You see, the fear of werewolves was real, and for the town of Bedburg, it was very real.', 'One report from this event tells of two men and a woman, who were travelling just outside the city walls. They heard a voice call out to them for help from within the trees beside the road, and one of the men stepped into the trees to give assistance. When he didn’t return, the second man entered the woods to find him, and he also didn’t return. The woman caught on, attempted to run, but something exited the woods and attacked her. The bodies of the men were later found, mangled and torn apart, but the woman’s never was. Later, villagers found severed limbs in the fields near Bedburg, limbs from the people who were missing. It was clear that something horrible was hunting them.', 'Another report tells of a group of children playing in a field near the cattle. As they played, something ran into the field and grabbed a small girl by the neck before trying to tear her throat out. Thankfully the high collar on her dress actually saved her life, and she managed to scream. Now, cows don’t like screaming apparently, and they began to stampede. Frightened by the cattle, the attacker let go of the girl and ran for the forest, and this was the last straw for the people of Bedburg. They took the hunt to the beast.', 'According to a pamphlet from 1589, the men of the town hunted for the creature for days. Accompanied by dogs and armed for killing, these brave men ventured into the forest and, finally, found it. In the end, it was the dogs that cornered the beast. Dogs are fast and they beat the men to their prey. When the hunters finally did arrive, they found the creature cornered. According to the pamphlet, the wolf transformed into a man right before their eyes. While the wolf had been just another beast, the man was someone they recognised. It was a wealthy, well-respected farmer from town named Peter Stubbe, sometimes recorded as Stumpp. Stubbe confessed to it all, and his story seemed to confirm their darkest fears. He told them that he had made a pact with the devil at the age of 12. The deal? In exchange for his soul, the devil would give him a plethora of worldly pleasures, but like most stories, a greedy heart is difficult to satisfy. Stubbe admitted to being a, and I quote, \xa0“wicked fiend, with the desire for wrong and destruction”, that he was “inclined to blood and cruelty”. Now, to sate that thirst, the devil had given him a magical belt of wolf skin. Putting it on, he claimed, would transform him into the monstrous shape of a wolf. Sound familiar?', 'He told the men that had captured him that he had taken off the belt in the forest, and some were sent back to retrieve it, but it was never found. Still, superstition and fear drove them to torture and interrogate the man, who confessed to decades of horrible, unspeakable crimes. Well-known around the town, Stubbe told his captors that he would often walk through Bedburg and wave to the families and friends of those he had killed. It delighted him, he said, that none of them suspected that he was the killer. Sometimes he would use these walks to pick out future victims, planning how he would get them outside the city walls, where he could, and I quote, “ravish and cruelly murder them”. Stubbe even admitted to going on killing sprees simply because he took pleasure in the bloodshed. He would kill lambs and goats and eat their raw flesh. He even claimed to have eaten unborn children, ripped straight from their mothers’ wombs.', 'The human mind is always solving problems, even when we’re asleep and unaware of it. The world is full of things that don’t always sit right with us, and in our attempt to deal with life we… rationalise. In more superstitious times it was easy to lean on old fears and legends. The Tuberculosis outbreaks of the 1800s led people to truly believe that the dead were sucking the life out of the living. The stories that gave birth to the vampire mythology also provided people with a way to process Tuberculosis and its horrible symptoms. Perhaps the story of the werewolf shows us that same phenomenon, but in reverse. Rather than creating stories to explain the mysteries of death, perhaps we created the story of the werewolf to help justify the horrors of life and human nature. The tale of Peter Stubbe sounds terrible, but when you hold it up to modern day serial killers, such as Jeffery Dahmer or Richard Trenton Chase, it’s par for the course. The difference between them and Stubbe is simply 400 years of modernisation. With the advent of electrical lights pushing away the darkness and global exploration exposing much of the world’s fears to be just myth, it’s become more and more difficult to blame our flaws on monsters. The beast, it turns out, has been inside us the whole time.', 'And Peter Stubbe? Well, the people of Bedburg executed him for his crimes. On October 31', ', 1589, (Halloween, mind you) he was given what was thought to be a fair and just punishment. He was strapped, spread eagle and naked, to a large, wooden wheel, and then his skin was pealed off with red hot pinchers. They broke his arms and legs with the blunt end of an axe before finally turning the blade over, and chopping off his head. His body was burnt at the stake in front of the entire town, and then his torture wheel was mounted on a tall pole, topped with the statue of a wolf. On top of that, they placed his severed head. Justice, or just one more example of the cruelty of mankind? Perhaps in the end, we’re all really monsters, aren’t we?', 'was produced by me, Aaron Mahnke.

In many ways, the stories we tell and the lessons we pass on\nare like a tree - the branches reach out into generations and cultures,\nsometimes in obvious ways, and other times reaching surprising new places.

How or why is something we’ll probably never fully understand, but it\nshows us how folklore can spread, how it can migrate, and how it can build upon\nthe past. At the same time, though, folklore has roots, and they run deeper\nthan we might expect. Some stories that we still whisper about in the dark\ntoday have crossed the lips of people for centuries, and in some cases,\nmillennia. When I hear a story for the first time or discover a new collection\nof tales that have been widely distributed, I often stop and ask myself the\nsame questions: where did it come from? What lies at the bottom of the\nnarrative? What are its roots? Outside of Halloween, there is no other time of\nthe year (at least for European cultures, that is) where folklore rushes to the\nforefront of everyone’s lives with such significance, such power, and such ease\nas the Christmas season, and rightly so. There is so much there to unpack and\nexplore: the tree, the gifts, the food, and the nocturnal visit from a\nstranger, one who has seemingly stalked our lives all year long, and yet we\nblindly welcome into our home. And if there’s one lesson that folklore has\ntaught us over the centuries, it’s to beware of strangers – they aren’t always\nwho they seem to be. I’m Aaron Mahnke and this is ', '.

Just how did ', 'dish\nout her punishment on the people of Germany? Well, a hint can be found in her\nother popular title: the belly-slitter. During the 12 days of Christmas, she\nwould travel through the towns and inspect the people’s behaviour. If they had\nfollowed the rules and done right in her eyes, they were rewarded.

Instead, they believe\nthat the story has roots in an ancient alpine myth of a horned god of the\nwitches. Even the switch, his weapon of choice, might have been a carry-over\nfrom the initiation rites of witches, where the novices were beaten. Far from\nforgotten, festivals are held throughout Europe to this day that feature many\nof these legends; events like ', 'in Germany and the ', 'festival\nin Urbania attract tens of thousands, who dress in masks and dance and\ncelebrate. Like Halloween, these are instances where monsters and strangers\nhave been embraced and elevated to something of a children’s story, which is\nironic when you understand the roots. Stripping away the detail, ', 'has (from a 30-thousand-foot\nview) more than a passing resemblance to Pan, the Greek horned god of nature,\nshepherds, flocks, and mountains. Along with his musical flute, Pan is often\nknown for robbing the innocence from people, usually through sexual means. In a\nculture that saw the threshold between childhood and adulthood as the loss of\nvirginity, Pan figuratively stole people’s children, and when you think of it\nthat way, it’s more than easy to see similarities, not only between Krampus and\nPan, but also between Pan and a character that Disney has helped us all fall in\nlove with: Peter Pan. While he might be able to fly, has no horns and is\nmissing the cloven feet that Pan sports in every image and statue, Peter Pan\nfulfils the role perfectly. He arrives at night, he carries a flute and lures\nour children away to another place. It’s a modern story with a familiar ending,\nbut it was far from the first of its kind. That honour, according to some,\nfalls to a small German village in 1284. You might already know the story, but\nthe truth beneath it is far worse than you’d ever expect. ', '\nIn 1284, the German village of Hamlin was struggling with an infestation of\nrats. Now, I’ve only seen a few rats myself over years, but I also don’t live\nin a densely populated urban area like New York City or London. But in medieval\nEurope, from what I can gather, rats were as abundant as squirrels, only bigger\nand more disease-ridden. It’s hard to imagine the impact that an infestation of\nrats could have on a town today. If we found a half-eaten bag of flour in the\ncupboard, there’s a grocery store down the street where we could get more, year-round.\nBut in the Middle Ages, food was grown locally and used throughout the year. If\nrats ate and ruined the food supplies, there was little a town could do - rats\nmeant death in many instances. According to the story that has been passed down\nthrough the centuries since then, a stranger entered Hamelin in the Spring of\n1284. He was dressed in colourful clothing, possessed what we might call today\nas a “silver tongue”, and claimed to have a very unusual, although also very timely,\nskill – he was a rat catcher. As a profession, rat catching dates back centuries,\nbut it’s rarely seen as a safe and sanitary job. The risk of being bitten or\ncontracting some disease carried by the rats has always been a hazard of the job,\nand while the exact nature of their involvement has been up for debate for decades,\nmost scholars agree that rats have been key players in the spread of plague -\nparticularly the Black Death of the 14', ' century, and there were few\ntruly effective tools at their disposal, which made the job that much more difficult.\nSome rat catchers used a special breed of terrier while others made use of\ntraps, but the most effective tool for centuries was also the most minimal and inexpensive\nof them all, bare hands - and seeing as how most rats prefer to stay hidden\ninside dark places, this was a risky technique. The motivation for it all,\nthough, was the meritocracy of it; the more you caught, the more you earned,\nand while there’s no documented proof of this rumour, it’s been whispered for\ncenturies that rat catchers would sometimes raise their own rats in captivity\nand then turn them in as part of the job, inflating their numbers and then\ntheir pay. This allowed them to pad their pay checks when business was slow,\nand it also earned them a shady reputation. As a side note, one of the most\nfamous rat catchers in London’s history was a man named Jack Black, who claimed\nthat his black-tan terrier was the father of all the black-tan terriers in\nLondon, and who pioneered the art of breeding rats and keeping them as pets. He\neven wore an outfit made entirely of scarlet cloth, with a big, wide sash\nacross his chest that had two cast iron rats on it. He was probably also a riot\nat parties, but I can’t confirm that – just a hunch. ', 'The man\nwho walked into Hamelin that June wasn’t any less of a character, if the\nlegends are to be believed. He wore an outrageous outfit, although his was\nreportedly one of multicoloured fabric that was known back then as “pied” (which\nwas typically a sort of blotchy pattern), and he carried a tool that no other\nrat catcher claimed to use - a flute - and the mayor of Hamelin trusted the\nman. Maybe it was the not-so-subtle allusion his appearance made to the ancient\nstories of the god Pan, a deity who tended flocks of animals and played a flute;\nmaybe it was the man’s marketing ability, that silver tongue and outrageous outfit;\nperhaps he overpromised and won the mayor’s approval - whatever the reason,\nthis stranger was said to have struck a deal. He would catch all the rats in\ntown, he told the mayor. He would lead them out of the town and away from their\nlives and he would do this, he said, with his musical instrument, a pipe that\nhe claimed would lure them away. Now, I don’t know about you, but I would have\nbeen sceptical. The mayor, though, was desperate. Sure, they haggled over the price,\nbut in the end the stranger won. The exact amount of money differs from version\nto version of the story, but in all of them it’s an exorbitant sum, and that’s\nthe point. Hamelin was so desperate that they were willing to overpay for a\nsolution, and then he got to work. According to all the stories, and even the\nchildren’s tales we were raised on, the piper picked up his flute and began to\nplay. As if driven by some magical force, all of the rats in Hamelin scuttled\nout of their hiding places and began to crowd around him; streams of them,\nthousands of them, all writhing in a mass at his feet. Then, when it seemed\nlike they had all come out, he marched out of town and down to the Vesser\nriver. The stories say that he was beyond successful. Most accounts say that\nall but one of the rats drowned in the river that day. Hamelin’s troubles were\nover, for a while. You see, the piper returned later to collect his money - he\nhad done the job they had hired him to perform, the rats were gone, but for\nsome unknown reason, the mayor refused to pay him. Now, the stories don’t say\nwhy, but we can speculate. Maybe it was because the stranger didn’t return with\nany bodies to show for his work, as was the custom for a rat catcher. How could\nthe town pay him per head when there were no heads to count? At any rate, the\nmayor turned the stranger away and the man, clearly taken advantage of, stormed\nout of the village, but not before turning to face the people of Hamelin and\nproclaim a curse on them. He would return one day, he said, and when he did, he\nwould have his revenge. Remember, this is a story that has been passed down for\n800 years - most of what we know about the real events is pure legend, based\nloosely on scattered reports of a stained-glass window in the church there, in\nHamelin. The window itself was lost in 1660, but there a drawings of it that\npredate the destruction as far back as the 14', ' century, and the\nearliest mention of these events is a 1384 entry in the Hamelin town records.\nThe events were recorded, of course, because the stranger did return. According\nto the story, though, he changed clothing, trading in his colourful robes for\nthe uniform of a hunter. Gone was the salesman; the stranger was returning for vengeance.\nWhile the adults were in church on June 26', ', the stranger strode\ninto town and began to play his flute again. This time, rather than crowds of writhing\nrats, it was the children who clambered out of the houses. They flooded the\nstreets, gathering around the strange visitor, and then, when they were all\npresent, he marched them out of town, never to be seen again. There are, of\ncourse, a number of morals to this story, but the one that has stuck with us\nfor centuries remains ever-true: never trust a stranger. ', 'Folklore\nis full of strangers. In many stories, it’s flat-out amazing just how much\nfreedom we have given them in our lives. Even stories of someone as benign as\nSanta Claus have an element of danger when you view them from outside cultural\nfishbowl. Here’s the story of a strange man who stalks our children year-round,\nnoting their behaviour and secret desires, who then breaks into our homes, eats\nour food, and leaves a few presents to prove that he was there. For the people\nof Hamelin, though, that stranger cost them far more than a plate of cookies.\nTheir ill treatment of the man who came to town led to the loss of their\nchildren, and as difficult as it is to believe, the story of Hamelin is true –\npart of it, at least. Scholars are in agreement that the rats were a later\naddition to the tale, showing up about 300 years after the events were said to\nhave taken place. But as far back as the records go, there has always been a\nstranger, a visitor from the outside, who leaves with the children, and although\nit’s taken a very long time to figure out why, some historians think they have\nthe answer. To understand the truth, they say, we first have to understand the\npolitical culture that Hamelin found itself in. In 1227, about 50 years prior\nto the events of Hamelin, a battle took place on the border between what was\nthen the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark, pushing the Danish border north of modern-day\nGermany. As a result, a whole new territory opened up that needed colonists.\nMen called “locators” were assigned to travel the land and find volunteers to\npopulate this new territory, who often wore colourful clothing. They were eloquent\nspeakers. They were, in a sense, a lot like today’s door-to-door salesmen. The\nempire needed farmers and craftsmen and soldiers to protect these new lands,\nbut it was hard to find people willing to uproot their lives and travel north,\nespecially when that new land was alongside a contested, military-heavy border.\nIt was a hard sell, and so when the locators came knocking, rather than\nshipping off a handful of adult volunteers, townsfolk would sometimes get\ncreative. Instead of paying with their own lives, they would sell their\nchildren to these men. The proof, it turns out, is in the phonebook, and on Google\nmaps. Many town names along a line between Hamelin and Poland bear a striking resemblance\nto town names from medieval Germany, oftentimes even showing up more than once.\nEven more compelling, surnames from the 1284 Hamelin town records still show up\nin phonebooks in Pomerania, a region of Poland along the Baltic sea. The folklore,\nyou see, tells a colourful story, one that’s as easy for children to swallow as\na spoonful of honey, but the truth that the story hides turns out to be far\nless palatable. An entire town, desperate for a solution to their economic and\nsocial challenges, actually sold their children off to recruiters hoping to\ncolonise new lands. It’s a plot reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan’s ', ', in that these people\nconstructed a fantasy around certain events, and then passed that lie on to\nlater generations in order to justify their actions and avoid questions. In the\nend, an outsider did indeed come to Hamelin that day, but he wasn’t the one who\ntook the children. No, it turns out that the true monsters were already there,\nliving in the house next door, shopping in the market, farming the fields. The\nmost dangerous stranger, it seems, isn’t the outsider – it’s the one that hides\namong us. ', '[Closing statements]']"

Sure, we often think of obsessions like sex, violence, gigantic robots and of course, epic battles between good and evil. But another obsession of Hollywood is vampires. You have to admit though, that there’s a lot to love about vampires. Immortality, wealth, power, and superhuman abilities such as flight and strength. Yes, they come with trade-offs, such as incredibly bad sunburns, but every movie I’ve seen, and I’ve seen a lot, believe me, tends to show vampires that are fairly happy with their lot in life. My exposure to the world of vampires happened in the late 1990s, when I was in college. A friend of mine recommended the Anne Rice novel, ', 'I devoured that and many of the sequels. They’re fun reads! And they certainly set the tone for a decade or more of vampire-centred entertainment. I won’t touch on the vampires of the Twilight books, mostly because I haven’t read them. But I will say this: those books, however lambasted they have been by critics, have shown that popular culture’s love of all things vampire is as undying as the creatures themselves. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '.', 'When most people think of vampires, they envision something that is a purely European creature: a foreign accent, Victorian Era dress, and dark manor homes and castles. It’s a common visual language for most of the western world, so I don’t blame bad movies and books for portraying that image, but it’s one small facet of a legend that has hundreds of expressions. The single most prominent historical figure attached to the modern notion of vampires is of course Vlad III of Wallachia, otherwise known as Vlad the Impaler. Vlad was the ruler of a small Eastern European kingdom known as Wallachia. He ruled from 1456 to 1462. He was known as Vlad the Impaler, because he preferred to execute his enemies by impaling them on stakes. The Ottomons called him “Lord Impaler” after entering his kingdom to find forests of impaled victims. Vlad was a violent guy, you see, rather bloodthirsty, you might say. Now he, like his father before him, belonged to something known as the Order of the Dragon, a group established to protect Christian Europe from the invading Ottoman army. Vlad’s father, Vlad II, was known as Vlad Dracul, which meant Vlad the Dragon, from the Order of the Dragon. When Vlad III rose to power he took the hereditary title and was known as Vlad Dracula, the son of the dragon. That name might sound very similar to the most famous vampire story in the world, and that’s because Bram Stoker, when creating his famous creature of the night, used Vlad III as his inspiration. Well, part of it, but we’ll get to that more later.', 'The roots of most vampire stories can be traced back to superstitions rooted in ancient cultures all across the world. Western Europe played host to countless stories of reanimated dead known as “revenants”. These were animated corpses which climbed out of the grave to torment the living. The word “revenant” comes from Latin, which means “to come back”. And come back to do what, you might ask? Well, I’m glad you did. At first it was just to terrorise the living, but as the centuries passed the legend became more specific. Revenants were said to return from the grave to torment their living relatives and neighbours. What was key though, was that revenants were specific people, not anonymous zombies of our modern horror genre. These things had a past, and a purpose. Now, in Norse Mythology, we can find stories of creatures known as ', ', “again-walkers”, who would return from the grave and wreak havoc on the living. These creatures possessed superhuman strength, they smelled of decay, and they were reported to be pretty ugly in appearance. They could enter the dreams of the living and while they were doing that, it was said that they left tangible objects near the sleeping victims, so that when they woke up, they would know that their dreams were more real than they feared.', 'Let’s go back earlier than the Middles Ages though. The legends of some ancient cultures spoke of creatures that, while not immediately similar to the vampires we know today, nonetheless share many core characteristics. First we have the Greek myth of Empusa, who was the daughter of Hekate. Empusa was said to lure young men, at night, and then feast on their blood, before moving on to the main course, their flesh. Another Greek tale involves Lamia, a mistress of Zeus, who becomes cursed by Zeus’ wife Hera, and is doomed to hunt children, devouring them. Stories of undead creatures, or creatures that feed on the blood of the living, seem nearly as common as written language itself. I mean, even on the small, isolated island of Madagascar, there are legends of a creature known as the Ramanga, which was known to attack nobles, drinking their blood and eating their nail clippings. Yeah, I said nail clippings. Deal with it.', 'Are vampires real? I’ll let you make the final decision on that, but what ', ' clear, is that most of these stories find their genesis in the human need to explain the unexplainable. For instance, early Europeans used the myth as a way of explaining why a corpse wasn’t decomposing at the normal rate that they expected. You can see evidence of this in Bulgaria, where graves dating back over 800 years, have been opened, to reveal iron rods that have been driven through the chest of the skeletons. And in a time when it was very common to bury someone that was thought to be dead, only to find out that they weren’t really dead, you can imagine that stories would quickly circulate that the dead were coming back to life. As a result, Taphophobia, the fear of being buried alive, swept Europe and the United States. Now, of course, when medical science caught up, people got more practical. They built alert systems into graves, just in case the person woke up and, you know, wanted out. Now, I realise that being buried alive sounds like a rare occurrence, but it happened frequently enough that many people were sufficiently paranoid about it to actually spend time looking for a solution.', 'One of these people happened to be a medical doctor, a man named Adolf Gutsmuth. Now, in 1822, and driven by the fear of being buried alive, he invented a “safety coffin” for his own interment, and then he tested it out himself. Tested it out? You bet! Doctor Gutsmuth allowed himself to be buried underground in his new “safety coffin” for several hours, during which he had meals delivered to him through a feeding tube. He enjoyed a wonderful meal of soup, sausages, and a lovely local beer. Sounds like a great date night destination, doesn’t it? Now, Doctor Timothy Smith of New Haven, Vermont, was another paranoid inventor. He created a grave that can be visited still to this day, if you happen to be passing by Evergreen Cemetery, in Vermont. It was a crypt, buried in the usual manner, but it had a cement tube positioned over the face of the body, and a glass plate was affixed to the top of the tube at ground level. Doctor Smith died a real, natural death, and was buried in his fancy coffin with a view. He never woke up, but early visitors to his grave reported that they had a clear view of his decomposing head, until condensation obscured the glass decades later. Side note: vampires no longer scare me. Waking up inside of a small box buried six feet under the surface of the earth is what true fright looks like to me.', 'Now, another culprit in humanity’s use of the vampire label, was porphyria. It was a rare blood disorder, but modern science has pretty much closed the case on that one, saying that it’s too far of a stretch to connect the two topics. Rabies, of all conditions, has also been used as an explanation for the rise of the vampire mythology. Surprisingly there are a lot of commonalities between them, such as a sensitivity to light and garlic, as well as altered sleep patterns. But the most recent medical condition with a strong connection to vampire mythology was actually Tuberculosis. Those who suffer from TB had no vampire-like symptoms though, and that’s what makes this one a harder connection to explain. It’s also, incidentally, where one of my favourite New England legends comes into the picture. Ladies and Gentlemen, meet Mercy Brown.', 'Lena Mercy Brown was a young woman who lived in the latter half of the 19', 'century, in the rural town of Exeter, Rhode Island, and she was a major player in what is now known as the “Great New England Vampire Panic”. Stories like hers can be found repeated all across Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, echoed in the lives of others in similar situations. And the results have surprising connections to both the modern idea of vampires, as well as the ancient stories, as we will see. The first person to die in Exeter was Mercy’s mother, Mary Eliza. That was December of 1882, and she fell victim to what was then called “consumption”. Consumption, because, as the disease of Tuberculosis ravaged the body, the person would appear to waste away; consumed, if you will, by the illness. She, of course, was buried, because, well, that’s what you do with a loved one who passes away. The next year though, Mercy’s sister Mary Olive died, at the young age of 20. Same illness, same symptoms, same process. I’m not sure when exactly the people of Exeter, Rhode Island started to wonder if the deaths were connected , but it might have been then, or it might have been a few years later when Mercy’ brother Edwin took ill. Edwin, though, was smart. He packed up and moved across the country to Colorado Springs, which had a great reputation for the healing properties of its dry climate. When he finally returned from the resorts out west, some years later, he was alive, but not doing so well, and in December of 1891, he took a turn for the worst. That was the month that Mercy herself became ill. Her Tuberculosis moved fast. They called it the galloping kind, and it moved through her body quickly, like wildfire. By January, 1892, she was dead, and the people of Exeter were more worried than ever. You see, they suspected something… supernatural.', 'Now, this was surprising, considering how close Exeter is to Newport. That’s the seaside city known for the summer cottages of the wealthy, folks like the Vanderbilts, the Asters, the Wideners, the Wetmores. It was the pinnacle of educated society, yet just a handful of miles away, one small town that should have known better, was about to do something very, very creepy.', 'Edwin was still alive, you see, and someone got it in their mind that one of the women who died before him, either his mother or one of his sisters, was somehow draining him of his life from beyond the grave. They were so convinced of this, you see, that they wanted to dig them all up. Yes, all of them. Once they received the father’s permission to do this horrible thing, a group of men gathered in the cemetery on the morning of March 17', ', and began to dig up the bodies. Now, what they were looking for was any evidence at all of an unnatural state. So, blood in the heart, blood around the mouth, or other similar signs. The first body, of Mary Eliza, the mother, was satisfactorily decomposed so they ruled her out. But of course she was, you might say, I mean, she had been dead and buried for a decade. Mary Olive was also in a normal state of decomposition. Again, being dead for ten years usually helps convince people that you’re really dead. But when they examined Mercy’s body, a body that had not been buried because she died in the middle of winter, and so had been put inside of a stone building inside the cemetery that was essentially a walk-in freezer, they discovered a remarkable state of preservation. Shocking, I know. So what did they do? Well, these superstitious folk did what they learnt from their ancestors. They cut out Mercy’s heart and liver, within which they found red, clotted blood, they burned them on a nearby stone, which, by the way, is still there if you ever visit the cemetery, and then, mixed the ashes with a tonic. That tonic was then given to Edwin, to drink. Yeah, Edwin drank his own sister’s liver and heart. Did it work? No, of course it didn’t work. Edwin died less than two months later. What it did do, however, was set up Mercy Brown to be known as the first American vampire.', 'As unusual as an event like this must sound, you might be surprised to learn that it happened quite frequently. In 1817, almost a century before Mercy Brown’s exhumation, a Dartmouth college student named Frederick Ransom died of Tuberculosis. His father was so worried that the young man would leave the grave and attack the family, that he asked that he be dug up. Ransom’s heart was cut out, and burnt on a blacksmith’s forge. Even Henry David Thoreau heard tales of these types of events, and he mentioned one in his personal journal. In September 26', ', 1859, he wrote: “The savage in man is never quite eradicated. I have just read of a family in Vermont who, several of its members having died of consumption, just burnt the lungs, heart and liver of the last deceased, in order to prevent any more from having it.” So of course, word spread about what happened to Mercy Brown, as it usually did when a body was dug up and carved into to pieces like that. Mercy’s case, though, actually made it into a newspaper called ', ', and it made quite an impression on the people who read it. How do we know? Because a clipping from that article was found in the personal papers of a London stage manager after his death. You see, his theatre company had been touring America in 1892. He evidently read the story, found it inspiring, and saved it. Inspiring so much so, that he sat down a few years later, and wrote a book. Who was this man? His name was Bram Stoker. And the book? Oh, I’m sure you’ve already guessed it by now. It was ', ', published in 1897.', 'was produced by me, Aaron Mahnke.

It’s known as the Álftanes peninsula, and although few people live there, the local government recently decided to connect this small stretch of land to the town of Garðabær, a suburb of Reykjavik. Last year, however, construction on the new road was brought to a halt. Standing in their way was a massive rock, 12ft high and weighing an estimated 70 tons. According to highway department employee Petur Matthiasson, the rock has presented an unusual challenge to his department’s construction project. Now, you have to understand something about Iceland. Much of the region is a vast expanse of sparse grass and large volcanic rock formations. The ground literally boils with hot water at springs and geysers, and the sky seems to be eternally grey and cloudy. So, it’s important to recognise that there are hundreds, maybe thousands of these volcanic stones along the construction route. So, what could possibly be so important about this one, particular stone? Why would the highway department go to such lengths, even covering the expense of hiring a crane, just to move the stone to a safer location? The stone, they say, is inhabited. It is, as it has been for many long centuries, home to the ', '- the “hidden people”. They are the size and shape of humans and live in much the same way that we do, except, of course, they’re invisible. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', 'In the late 1930s, another road construction project in the same area of Iceland was planned to cut straight through a hill known as Alfholl. From the beginning though, the project was met with challenges. First, the money for the project simply ran out, and when funding resumed a decade later, construction encountered even more problems. The machines that were used to cut through the hill started to break at an unusual rate. Tools were damaged and lost. In the end, the road was simply built around the hill to avoid the digging altogether. When the road was due for updating in the 1980s, the notion of demolishing the hill was, again, brought up, and this time more machinery was brought in to drill through the actual hill. After the first drill broke, another was brought in, but it too stopped working. After that the workers themselves even refused to bring any of their own tools near the hill out of fear that they would be lost or broken by the ', ' who guard the place. Iceland is a culture that is teaming with references to this invisible society of human-like creatures. In a recent survey, more than half the people in the country (54%, in fact) said that they believed in the existence of these creatures. But who are the ', '?', 'According to one Icelandic folk tale, the hidden people can be traced back to Adam and Eve. According to the legend, Eve had a number of children who she hid from God. But God, being omniscient and aware of everything that happens, found them anyway. In the story, God declared that what man hides from God, God will hide from man. As a result, these children of Adam and Eve vanished from sight and have lived alongside humans ever since, hidden from our eyes. Wherever they came from, Iceland is apparently filled with them. They are described as being the same size as humans, usually clad in 19', ' century Icelandic clothing, which is often described as being green and simple. The people of Iceland have another term for these creatures, though. They don’t use it as often as ', ', because they feel it’s not as respectful to the hidden people, but it’s a word we all know, and its history and meaning run very deep. They call them… elves.', 'When we think of elves, most of us imagine the little people who help Santa Claus in his workshop at the North Pole. We picture tiny people with pointed ears who wear tall, pointed hats. But that vision of elves is actually new, dating back only to Victorian Era fairy tales, when French stories of fairies were mixed and confused with more ancient tales of elves from the Celtic, Germanic and Scandinavian peoples. The oldest records of something resembling elves are from Anglo-Saxon England and medieval Iceland, though there are some records that exist from Germany as well, and the characteristics are consistent across the continents. Elves were described as human-like; that they were once divine creatures of some unknown origin, and that they were very, very dangerous. In Norse Mythology elves were mainly thought of as females who lived in the hills and mounds of stone. The Swedish elves were said to be beautiful girls who lived in the forest with their king, and Scandinavian folklore describes them as fair-haired, dressed in white, and dangerous when offended. In fact, in many folk tales elves were given the role of the disease spirits. An elf could inflict horrible skin rashes on the one who offended them, and the term was called an “elven blow”. The only way to calm and satisfy them was to actually visit their homes, often a large pile of stones or a large stone in the woods, and leave them an offering of food. Elves, you see, were dangerous.', 'At first, elves were simply thought of as mischievous pranksters. Anything odd that happened during a person’s day could be blamed on elves. A tangle in a person’s hair was called an elf-lock, and birth marks were referred to as elf-marks. Elves had a darker side, however. Much like their cultural counterparts in other countries such as hobs, leprechauns, hob-goblins and trolls, elves were known to be highly dangerous. A deeply common thread through all cultures is how easy it is to offend them, and how terrible the consequences might be if that happened. One such tale was that of the “changeling”. According to legend, elves would invade the home of new parents and swap out their infant child for a small elf. Now, while the human baby would be wonderfully cared for back in the home of the elves, the surrogate that was left behind – the “changeling”, it was called – would be fussy and unhappy. In Iceland, there are tales of ', ' who kidnapped adults, who are then taken back to the hills to work for the hidden people. In their place, the ', 'leave emotionless, hollow copies of the ones they take. It was said that if someone you knew underwent a severe personality change, becoming depressed or listless, it was because they had been replaced by the elves. It was also believed that elves could enter the dreams of a sleeping person and cause nightmares to happen. In fact, the German word for nightmare is ', ', which literally means “elf pressure”. You see, if it was horrible, unexplainable or tragic, there was always one easy explanation that dominated medieval minds: blame it on the elves.', 'But what if these were more than just folktales? If so, that might explain the incredibly similar stories that exist among the native tribes of the American north-east. In 2011, a non-profit housing developer in the United States began the final stages of their plan to build a $19 million, 120 unit construction project known as “The Villages”. Everything about it looked promising. It would generate roughly $1.5 million in tax revenue for the town of Montville, Connecticut, it would create over 100 construction-related jobs, and once completed, would actually provide affordable housing for scores of local families. Now, because the “Villages” project was a non-profit endeavour, the development company applied for federal funding to offset their costs. As a requirement for the funding process, the developer was required to complete an archaeological survey of the 12.2 \xa0acre parcel of land, and that’s when they hit a snag.', 'The proposed building site, it turns out, encroached on Mohican tribe property. The Mohican people were an offshoot of the Pequot tribe, originating in 17', 'century Connecticut. They had deep routes in the area, and naturally parts of their historic past are still present today. Among the sensitive archaeological sites that the Mohican tribe claimed were at risk were Fort Shantok, Moshup’s Rock, and Mohican Hill. None of those historic sites are unusual in any way, but when the tribal historic preservation officer for the Mohicans presented their case to the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department, there was one complaint that stood out among the others. Creatures, they claimed, lived inside Mohican Hill. The construction project threatened their lives, and unless it was stopped, the “little people”, as they called them, would disappear, leaving the tribe unprotected from outsiders. The tribe has long believed in the existence of creatures who they call ', ' - the “little people”. The stone piles on top of Mohican Hill were said to have been built by them long ago, and served as protection from the outside world. These ', 'have remained inside the hill ever since, guarding the stones and protecting the tribe. These were powerful creatures that could protect and preserve the tribe, but if ignored or treated poorly, could also bring great harm and chaos, and so naturally the Mohican people became very good at managing their relationship with them.', 'One of the most prominent Mohican tribe members of the last century was a woman named Gladys Tantaquidgeon, who passed away in 2005 at the age of 106. She was a 10', ' generation descendant of the Mohican chief Uncas, a prominent colonial era leader, and was also a tribal medicine woman. Her role included maintaining her tribe’s knowledge of the ', ', and how to interact with them. According to Tantaquidgeon, there were even four non-negotiable laws for dealing with the “little people”. First, serve and protect their leader and matriarchal deity, Granny Squannit. Second, never speak to them in the summer months, when they’re the most active. Third, never stare directly at one, or else the creature would become invisible and steal your belongings. And finally, leave them offerings from time to time. And so, to this day, the Mohican tribe continues to make offerings to these creatures and hopes that they will continue their role as protectors and guardians of the tribe. It is traditional to leave them an offering of cornmeal and berries, and sometimes even meat. Sound familiar?', 'The vast majority of people in the world don’t really believe in the existence of elves or hidden people living in the bones of the earth. One explanation as to why Iceland is different, though, actually has to do with the Vikings. You see, when they conquered a city, the Vikings had real life enemies to focus their hatred on. When they settled Iceland, however, no one else was there to be defeated. Perhaps the ', ' provided the excuse that the Vikings needed to feel like conquerors in a land with no native inhabitants. Other scholars believe that elves represent our connection to the earth of old. They are sort of a primitive environmentalism, a reminder of the way life used to be before urban sprawl and manufacturing left its mark on our world. Whatever the reason, our ancestors firmly believed in these other-worldly beings who could bless or curse them at will. Elves served as an excuse for the unexplained; as solid ground when nothing else seemed to make sense. We might laugh it off from our modern point of view today, but centuries ago, elves literally gave people an opportunity to hope, or a reason to be afraid.', 'And remember Petur Matthiasson, the highway department employee in Reykjavik, Iceland? He’s made it very clear to journalists that he doesn’t believe in elves, but that doesn’t stop him from telling an odd story to those who ask. Apparently, his family came from the northern side of Iceland long ago. There, in the wild north country, the family claimed to have had a protective elf who brought good fortune to them. When they moved south, the family elf remained behind. Petur recalled going on a camping trip in the north some years ago. Before he left, his father asked him, while he was there, to go and pay his respects to the elf and to thank her for the help she had given his family. Not being one to believe in the old stories, Petur claims he forgot. The next day, however, despite an overcast sky and wet drizzle, he woke up sore and blistered by what he described as something like a sunburn. In fact, he could barely stand. Did Petur experience some random, mysterious dermatological episode, or was he the victim of an elven blow from an angry family patron. Like his ancestors, the easiest explanation might just be the most otherworldly.', ' is a biweekly podcast and was produced by me, Aaron Mahnke.

Also, the first settlers were not “Vikings” as such, who were largely displaced wonderers, but were in fact settled men of power in Norway most likely.

If the human design was scheduled for a revision, that’s one of\nthe features that would get an overhaul. Our mortality has been an obsession\nsince the dawn of humanity itself – humans long for ways to avoid death, or at\nleast make it bearable. Some cultures have practically moved heaven and earth\ndoing so. Thousands of years ago, the Egyptians built enormous stone structures\nin order to house their dead and ensure them a place in the afterlife. They\nperfected the art of embalming so that even after death, their bodies might be\nready for a new existence in a new place. Death is a reality for all of us,\nwhether we like it or not. Young or old, rich or poor, healthy or sick, life is\none long journey down a road, and we walk until its over. Some think they see\nthe light at the end of it all while others hope for darkness, and that’s where\nthe mystery of it all comes in: no one knows what’s on the other side. We just\nknow that the proverbial walk ends at some point, and maybe that’s why we spend\nso much time guessing at it, building story and myth and belief around this\nthing we can’t put our finger on. What would be easier, some say, is if we just\ndidn’t die, if we somehow went on forever. It’s impossible, but we dream of it\nanyway. No one returns from the grave… do they? Most sane, well-adjusted people\nwould say no, but stories exist that say otherwise, and these stories aren’t\nnew. They’ve been around for thousands of years and span multiple cultures, and\nlike their subject matter these stories simply refuse to die. One reason for\nthat, as hard as it is to believe, is because some of those stories appear to\nbe true. Depending on where you look, and who you ask, there are whispers of\nthose who beat the odds. Sometimes the journey doesn’t end after all.\nSometimes, the dead really do walk. I’m Aaron Mahnke, and this is ', '. ', 'The\nquintessential zombie movie, the one that all the commentators say was\nresponsible for putting zombies on the map nearly 50 years ago, was George A.\nRomero’s ', '.\nThe creatures that Romero brought to the big screen managed to influence\ngenerations of film makers, giving us the iconic zombie that we see today in\ntelevision shows like ', '.\nThe trouble is, Romero never used the word “zombie” to describe the creatures\nfrom his landmark film. Instead, they were “ghouls”, a creature borrowed from\nArabian folklore. According to the mythology, ghouls are demons who eat the\ndead and, because of that, are traditionally found in graveyards. But Romero’s\nghouls were not the first undead creatures to hunger for the flesh and blood of\nthe living. Some think that honour falls to the ', ', the epic Greek poem written by Homer nearly 3000 years\nago. In the story, there’s a scene where Odysseus needs to get some information\nfrom a long-dead prophet named Tiresias. To give the spirit strength to speak,\nOdysseus feeds him blood. In a lot of ways, the creatures we think of today as\nzombies are similar to the European tales of the revenant. They’ve gone by many\nnames – the ancient Irish called them \n\nNeamh-Mhairbh, meaning “the undead”; in Germany\nthey are the ', 'he ones\nwho walk again”; and in Nordic mythology, they’re called the ', '. The name “revenant” itself is\nLatin and means “the returned”. The basic idea is pretty easy to guess from\nthat – revenants were those who were once dead, but returned to haunt and\nterrorize their neighbours and family. It might sound like fantasy to our\nmodern sensibilities, but some people really did think that this could happen. ', 'Historians\nin the Middle Ages wrote about revenant activity as if it were fact. One man,\nWilliam of Newburgh, wrote in 1190 that, and I quote, “It would not be easy to\nbelieve that the corpses of the dead should sally from their graves, and should\nwander about to the terror or destruction of the living, did not frequent\nexamples, occurring in our own times, suffice to establish this fact, to the\ntruth of which there is abundant testimony. Were I to write down all the\ninstances of this kind which I have ascertained to have befallen in our times,\nthe undertaking would be beyond measure, laborious, and troublesome”. Newburgh\ngoes on to wonder why the ancient writers never mentioned events like these,\nbut doesn’t seem to take that as proof that revenants are pure fantasy. They\nmentioned all sorts of boring things, mundane and unimportant, so why not the\nunnatural and unusual? He was, of course, wrong – the ancient Greeks did have\ncertain beliefs surrounding the dead and their ability to return to haunt the living,\nbut to them it was much more complicated, and each revenant came back with its\nown unique purpose. You see, the Greco-Roman culture believed that there was a\ngap between the date of someone’s actual death and their intended date of\ndeath. Remember, this was a culture that believed in the ', ' – the Fates – who had a plan for everyone. So, for example,\na farmer might be destined to die in his 80s from natural causes, but he might\ninstead die in an accident at the market or in his field. People who died\nearly, according to the legends, were doomed to wander the land of the living\nas spirits until the day of their intended death arrived. Still with me? Good.\nSo, what the Greeks believed was that it was possible to control those\nwandering spirits – all you needed to do was make a curse tablet, something\nwritten on clay or tin or even parchment, and then bury it in the person’s\ngrave. Like a key in the ignition of a car, this tablet would empower someone\nto control the wandering dead. Now, it might sound like the world’s creepiest\nMartha Stewart how-to project, but to the Greeks magic like this was a powerful\npart of their belief system. The dead weren’t really gone, and because of that\nthey could serve a purpose. Unfortunately, that’s not an attitude that was\nunique to the Greeks, and in the right culture, at the right time, under the\nright pressure, that idea can be devastating. ', 'In Haiti,\nthe vast majority of the people there are genetically connected to West Africa\nto some degree, up to 95% according to some studies. It’s a remnant of a darker\ntime, when slavery was legal, and millions of Africans were pulled from their\nhomes and transported across the Atlantic to work the sugar plantations that\nfilled the Spanish coffers. We tend to imagine African slaves being shipped to\nthe new world with no possessions beside the clothing on their backs, but they\ncame with their beliefs, with their customs and traditions, and with centuries\nof folklore and superstition. They might not have carried luggage filled with\nprecious heirlooms, but they held the most important pieces of their identity\nin their minds and hearts. No one can take that away. There are a few ideas\nthat need to be understood about this transplanted culture. First, they\nbelieved that the soul and the body were connected, but also that death could\nbe a moment of separation between the two. Not always, but it could be – I’ll\nexplain more about that in a moment. Second, they lived with a hatred and fear\nof slavery. Slavery, of course, took away their freedom, it took away their\npower. They no longer had control over their lives, their dreams, or even their\nown bodies. Whether they liked it or not, they were doomed to endure horribly\ndifficult labour for the rest of their lives; only death would break the chains\nand set them free. Third, that freedom wasn’t guaranteed. While most Africans\ndreamed of returning to their homeland in the afterlife, there were some who\nwanted to get there quicker. Suicide was common in colonial Haiti, but it was\nalso frowned upon. In fact, it was believed that those who ended their own life\nwouldn’t be taken back to Africa at all. Instead, they would be punished. The\npenalty, it was said, was eternal imprisonment inside their own body, without\ncontrol or power over themselves. It was, in a sense, just like their own life.\nTo the slaves of Haiti, hell was just more slavery, but a slavery that went on\nforever. These bodies and trapped souls had a name in their culture: the\nzombie. It was first recorded in 1872, when a linguistic scholar recorded a\nzombie as, and I quote, “a phantom or ghost, not infrequently heard in the\nsouthern states in nurseries and among the servants”. The name, it turns out,\nhas African roots as well. In the Congo they use the word ', ', which means the spirit of a dead person. It’s related to\ntwo other words that both mean “god” and “fetish” – fetish in the sense of\nmanufacturing a thing, a creature that has been made. The walking dead, at\nleast according to Haitian lore, are real.', 'What did\nthese ', 'look like? Well, thanks\nto Zora Neale Hurston, we have a first-hand account. Hurston was an African\nAmerican author, known for her novel ', ', and regarded as one of the pillars of the Harlem\nRenaissance. And it was while researching folklore during a trip to Haiti in\n1936 that she encountered one. In her book ', ', Hurston recounts what happened. “I had the rare opportunity to\nsee and touch an authentic case”, she wrote. “I listened to the broken noises\nin its throat…. If I had not experienced all of this in the strong sunlight\nof a hospital yard, I might have come away from Haiti interested but doubtful.\nBut I saw this case of Felicia Felix-Mentor which was vouched for by the\nhighest authority. So I know that there are Zombies in Haiti. People have been\ncalled back from the dead. The sight was dreadful. That blank face with the\ndead eyes. The eyelids were white all around the eyes as if it had been burned\nwith acid. There was nothing you could say to her or get from her except by\nlooking at her, and the sight of this wreckage was too much to endure for long”.\nWreckage. I can’t think of another word with as much beauty and horror as that,\nin the context. Something was happening in Haiti, and the result was wreckage,\nlives broken and torn apart by something – but what? The assumption might be\nthat these people had all attempted suicide, but suicide is common in many\ncultures, not just in Haiti. When you dig deeper, though, it’s possible to\nuncover the truth, and in this case, the truth is much darker than we like to\nbelieve. Zombies, it turns out, can be created. ', 'On the\nnight of April 30', ', 1962, a man walked into Albert Schweitzer\nHospital in Haiti. He was sick and complained of body aches, a fever and, most\nrecently, coughing fits that brought blood up from his lungs. Naturally, the\nmedical staff were concerned, and they admitted him for tests and treatment.\nThis man, Clairvius Narcisse, was seen by a number of medical doctors but his\ncondition quickly deteriorated. One of his sisters, Angelina, was there at his\nbedside, and according to her his lips turned blue and he complained to her about\na tingling sensation all over his body. But despite the hospital’s best\nefforts, Narcisse died the next day. Two doctors, one American and one\nAmerican-trained, each confirmed his death. The man’s sister, Angelina, signed\nthe death certificate after confirming the man’s identity. Because she couldn’t\nread or write, she did so by pressing her thumbprint onto the paper, and then\nhis family began the painful process of burying their loved one and trying to\nmove on. Death, as always, is a part of life; never a pleasant one, but a part\nnonetheless. Over 18 years later, in 1981, Angelina Narcisse was walking\nthrough the market in her village, something she did nearly every day. She knew\nthe faces of each vendor, she knew the scents and the sounds that filled the\nspace there, but when she looked down the dirt road toward the small crowd of\npeople something frightened her, and she screamed. There, walking toward her,\nwas her brother Clairvius. He was, of course, older now, but it was him. She\nwould have recognised him anywhere, and when he finally approached her and\nnamed himself with a childhood nickname, any doubt she might have had melted\naway. What followed was a whirlwind of revelations as Clairvius told his sister\nwhat had happened to him, and it all started, he said, in the hospital room.\nAccording to him, his last moments in the bed there were dark, but fully aware.\nHe could no longer see anyone, and he couldn’t move, but he remembered hearing\nthe doctor pronounce him dead. He remembered the sound of his sister weeping.\nHe even remembered the rough, cotton sheet being pulled up and over his face.\nBut awareness continued on to his funeral, where he claimed to hear the\nprocession. He even pointed to a scar on his face – he claimed that it was the\nresult of one of the coffin nails cutting him. Later, the family brought in a\npsychiatrist, who performed a series of tests on Clairvius to see is he was a\nfraud, but the man passed with flying colours, answering questions that no one\nbut Clairvius himself could have known. In an addition, over 200 friends and\nfamily members vouched for the man’s identity. This, all of them confirmed, was\nClairvius Narcisse. ', 'So, what\nhappened to him? According to Clairvius himself, he was poisoned by his brother\nover a property dispute. How? He wasn’t sure, but shortly after his burial, a\ngroup of men dug up his coffin and pulled him free. That’s a thought worth\nlocking away deep in the back of your brain, by the way: trapped inside a\ncoffin beneath the earth, blind and paralysed, cold and scared. It’s a wonder\nthe man didn’t go insane. The men who dug him up were led by a priest called a ', '. The men chained Clairvius and\nthen guided him away to a sugar plantation, where he was forced to work\nalongside others in a similar state of helplessness. Daily doses of a\nmysterious drug kept them all unable to resist or leave. According to his\nstory, he managed to escape two years later, but fearing what his brother might\ndo to him if he were to show up alive, he avoided returning home. It was only\nthe news of his brother’s death many years later that coaxed him out of hiding.\nThe story of Clairvius Narcisse has perplexed scientists and historians for\ndecades. In the 1980s, Harvard sent an ethno-botanist named Wade Davis to\ninvestigate the mysterious drug, and the result of his trip was a book called ', ', which would\ngo on to be a ', 'bestseller\nas well as a Hollywood movie, but few agree on the conclusions. Samples of the\ndrug that Wade collected have all been disproven, no illegal sugar plantations\nstaffed by zombie slaves has ever been discovered, and the doctors have been\naccused of misreading the symptoms and prematurely declaring the man dead –\nthere are so many doubts. To the people closest to him, though, the facts are\nsolid. Clairvius Narcisse died, his family watched his burial in the cemetery,\nhe was mourned and missed, and 18 years later he came back into their lives.\nThe walking dead: medical mishap or the result of Haitian black magic? We may\nnever know for sure.', 'Stories of\nthe walking dead are everywhere these days. It’s as if we’ve traded in our\nobsession with extending our life and resigned to the fact that normal death,\nthe kind where we die and stay dead, might be better. We fear death because it\nmeans the loss of control, the loss of purpose and freedom. Death, in the eyes\nof many people, robs us of our identity and replaces it with finality. It’s\nunderstandable, then, how slavery can be viewed through that same lens. It\nremoves a person’s ability to make decisions for themselves – it turns them, in\na sense, into nothing more than a machine for the benefit of another person.\nBut what if there really are individuals out there, the ', 'and evil priests, who have discovered a way to manufacture\ntheir own walking dead, who have perfected the art of enslaving a man or women\ndeeper than any slave owner might have managed before, to rob them of their\nvery soul and bind them to an afterlife of tireless, ceaseless labour? In\nFebruary of 1976, Francine Illeus was admitted to her local hospital in Haiti.\nShe said she felt weak and light-headed. Her digestive system was failing, and\nher stomach ached. The doctors there treated her and then released her. Several\ndays later, she passed away and was buried in the local graveyard. She had only\nbeen 30 years old. Three years later, Francine’s mother received a call from a\nfriend a few miles away. She needed her to come to the local marketplace there,\nand said it was urgent. Francine’s mother didn’t know what the trouble was, but\nshe made the journey as quickly as she could. Once there, she was told that a\nwoman had been found in the market. She was emaciated, catatonic, and refused\nto move from where she was squatting in the corner, head down, hands laced over\nher face. The woman, it turned out, was Francine Illeus. Her mother brought her\nhome and tried to help her, but Francine seemed to be gone. She was there in\nbody, but there was very little spirit left. Subsequent doctors and\npsychiatrists have spent time with Francine, but with very little progress to\nshow for it. On a whim, Francine’s mother had the coffin exhumed. She had to\nsee for herself if this woman, little more than a walking corpse, truly was her\ndaughter. Yes, the woman had the same scar on her forehead that her daughter had,\nyes, they looked alike, yes, others recognised her as Francine, but she needed\nto know for sure. When the men pulled the coffin out of the earth, it was\nheavy, too heavy, they murmured, to be empty. More doubtful by the minute,\nFrancine’s mother asked them to open it, and when the last nail had been pulled\nfree from the wood, the lid was lifted and cast aside. The coffin wasn’t empty\nafter all – it was full of rocks. ', '[Closing\nstatements]']"
