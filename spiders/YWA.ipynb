Mike:   Welcome to   You’re Wrong About  , the podcast that tips over the delivery truck of history and sees what comes out the back.\\xa0  Sarah:   Oh, I love that. I'm Sarah Marshall, I'm working on a book about the Satanic Panic.\\xa0  Mike:   I’m Michael Hobbes, I'm a reporter for the   Huffington Post  . And if you want to support the show, we are on Patreon at   patreon.com/yourewrongabout  . And you can also find cute t-shirts and other ways to support us, or you can just keep tuning in for our thrilling conclusion.\\xa0  Sarah:   We are talking about Disney today.\\xa0  Mike:   So, where are we?\\xa0  Sarah:   I'm going to ask you that question because it is your job to learn about   The Newsies.   And I'm curious about what you find to be salient about what we talked about last time?\\xa0  Mike:   I think the Newsies pronounce it, “What did I loin?”\\xa0 Last week we met the newsboys who stand on street corners selling the newspapers. This is how the newspapers reach the mass public. And just after we met our newsboys, we learned that Pulitzer and Hearst increased the price of the papes for them to sell. And all of a sudden, they sort of came out of the Spanish American war and were like, wait a minute. Nobody's buying the papers as much because the war is over, and we just gave up 10% of our profits. And this sucks. So let's go on strike.  Sarah:   Yeah. And we are talking about a real-life strike and we were also talking about a Disney film, that is very important to me and many other people, but is not apparently to the Disney Company.  One of the images that came into my head as I was researching this, because one of the words that comes up a lot in the story is ‘circulation’. Just imagine, think of New York City and the information flowing around New York City in 1899. And then think of the newsboys striking, and it's like the flow of blood around this body has been disrupted. I imagine it's like putting a tourniquet on like all four limbs.\\xa0  Mike:   And instead of numbness, you have ignorance of world events.\\xa0  Sarah:   Now, even though there's like more blood in this body than ever before, but I didn't know that image came into my head and it means a lot to me and trying to understand what the strike was and why it was so effective, that like these child workers accurately recognize themselves as like absolutely essential to the welfare of society.  Mike:   Right. It's not like they were selling donuts on the street and everyone just had to switch to cupcakes for a week. Like this was really the lifeblood of a democracy.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. I just think that there is tremendous power in recognizing the essential nature of your labor.\\xa0  Mike:   You need to know your with. I’m sorry, I'll stop now. I'll stop now. I'm sorry. That's the last one. I promise.\\xa0  Sarah:   You can keep doing it, just don't ruin all of my poignant moments.\\xa0  Mike:   You used to be charging $0.50 cents for a hundred poignant moments, and now it's $0.60 cents for a hundred poignant moments.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. So speaking of that pricing increase, I have a nice quote I want to review. This is from the new Irving Hall mass meeting rally that happens midway through the strike. At this point, the strike has grown very rapidly from an initial action in Long Island City, where some Newsboys toppled a distributor's card. And then turned the following day into a meeting of the Newsboys and lower Manhattan where they agreed to announce to Hearst and Pulitzer that if the price wasn't rolled back to its original price of $0.50 cents for a hundred papers instead of $0.60, then they were going to go on strike and the newspapers didn't take them seriously and so they did. And in a very short time were able to do exactly what they said they would.  So this is from Nasaw’s book,   Children of the City  ,   “For the boys and for the public who read about their strike, the highlight of the two weeks was the mass meeting held at New Irving Hall on Broome Street. Some 5,000 boys from all over the city showed up to shout their support. Early in the evening the Chairman, conscious of the effect favorable reports might have on building public support, asked the reporters present to please refrain from quoting the speakers as saying “these”, “those”, and “you’s”.\\xa0 Kid Blink, a strike organizer, urged the boys to stick like glue and a moment later, like plaster. Ain't that 10 cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer who are millionaires? Well, I guess it is. If they can't spare it, how can we. I'm trying to figure out how 10 cents on a hundred papers can mean more to a millionaire than it does to Newsboys, and I can't see it.”  What do you think about that?\\xa0  Mike:   I actually find this, I don't want to say emotional, but I would say resonant of reaching back to really the same anger that these 16-year-olds had in 1899 is really, I mean, word for word, the same anger as we have.  Sarah:   Yes. ”I’m trying to figure out how 10 cents on a hundred papers can mean more to a millionaire than it does to Newsboys, and I can't see it.”\\xa0 To me it's important to just like, let the voice of Kid Blink speak today. So we're going to take a little ride by pigeon sort of like Feivel at an American Tale. We're going back in time, back to the beginning of Newsboys. I just need to talk about carrier pigeons for a second. Okay. So we're going to talk about Daniel H. Craig, who is the pigeon innovator.  Mike:   And the best James Bond.\\xa0  Sarah:   “  As a young man, Craig apprentice in a newspaper office rather than go to work as a reporter for any paper. However, he saw that there was value in news as a commodity. He could collect news from other sources and sell it to those who bought and sold stocks and bonds, and who needed to anticipate how events might affect the markets. And the late 1830s he went to Baltimore, Maryland, where he became associated with Aaron S. Ebell the founder of the Baltimore Sun. Together. They experimented with using carrier pigeons to carry the news from Washington to Baltimore. Craig later took this technique north to sell news from Europe to Boston newspapers. The Cunard Line speedy shift's soft first in Canada, before sailing to Boston. The next day, when the steamers left for Boston, Daniel Craig would be on board carrying a basket of birds.\\xa0  During the two-day trip he read all the European newspapers on board and printed the most important news on tiny pieces of tissue paper. He attached these reports to the legs of the carrier pigeons. When the Massachusetts coast came into view, he released his birds. They carried the news to Boston hours before the shift reached the city. When the birds returned home, Craig's wife, Helena - who we can picture looking like Helena Bonham Carter, why not - would distribute the news to their clients among the Boston papers and telegraph it to Wall Street brokers and New York papers, such as Gordon Bennet's Herald. The intensely competitive Bennett paid Craig a $500 bonus for every hour that he received European news ahead of the other New York newspapers.\\xa0  When the other papers complained to the Cunard Line about Craig's unfair advantage, one ship captain seizes Craig's basket of pigeons. Anticipating such trouble, Craig had hidden one of the birds in his pocket. ‘I went on the deck and flew the bird close to the captain's head’,  Craig later recalled, ‘He darted into his state room and caught his rifle. But before he got a chance to shoot the bird was a mile above him, flying straight to his home in Boston, a hundred miles away.”  Mike:   Pigeons are lit. I didn't know, pigeons could go a hundred miles.\\xa0  Sarah:   Pigeons are fascinating. And basically, from what I understand, they're trained to return to the same place. You know, you don't tell them to go somewhere. You just take them to any location, and they can find their way home.\\xa0  Mike:   It's like a little homing beacon.  Sarah:   Pigeons carrying the news is wonderful to me. And also the idea that this was such a cutthroat industry and people were so desperate to get an edge over each other. And it was so important to get information from Europe, you know, an hour or two faster than the other guy. And that people had such an appetite and such need to know as soon as possible. I guess it's the original Twitter.\\xa0  Mike:   Literally. It was the “meep, meep”, Twitter of actual birds.  Sarah:   I guess they go “coo coo”. It was “coo”. I think that humans are fascinating to study if you try to take the perspective of like, what about the things we do reveals what is important to us? And this is one of them.  Mike:   I think somebody should write a short story about using pigeons in war and call it “Military Coo”.\\xa0 So how do the Newsboys come out of this news industry with the pigeons and everything?\\xa0  Sarah:   So the steam press is invented in the 1830s, and that's what makes it possible to produce newspapers on the scale that we associate with them today, like loaves of bread. Before that they have much lower circulations, they're more expensive to make, they're more expensive to buy. And the newspaper basically changes from something more like a magazine, like an issue of Vogue or something, into an object with greater freedom of movement. It's worthless monetarily, it appeals to more people. We're also seeing over time more newspapers, so you have all this choice as a consumer. According to DiGirolamo, we know the names of the first real Newsboys who were working without a wheelbarrow system. Because that's basically home delivery. They were hired in 1833 and some of their names are Bill Lovell, who is nine; Bernard Flaherty, who is 10; Henry Louis Gassert, who's 11.\\xa0  Mike:   Those are young kids, dude! Nine to eleven? \\xa0  Sarah:   Yes, young kids. And they respond to an ad that says,   “To the unemployed, a number of steady men can find employment by vending this paper. A liberal discount is allowed to those who buy and sell again.”  Mike:   They probably had a very good sense of the kinds of stories that sold, too. I mean, that seems like the kind of instinct that you would hone through years of sort of looking at one of those miserable front pages that we looked at last week and saying like, “Oh, this is the one that I'm going to cry out on the street.”\\xa0  Sarah:   Newspapers that they knew what they were doing would listen to what Newsies said. And there was, I forget what paper this happened to but DiGirolamo talks about the fact that there was a paper that was running poetry, and at some point one or some of the newsboys were like, “He’s gotta stop because nobody buys poetry.” And they did. 13 boys, man.  Mike:   Thirteen boys, man. Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   We talked a little bit last time about the kind of the constant verge of moral panic, feeling that a lot of the child welfare societies and advocates had toward Newsies and the 19th century. But also the idea that they had a troubling amount of agency because they like could earn profits and they could buy stuff that they wanted to.\\xa0  Mike:   Right. They could get their own cronuts.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. Well actually, I have a quote for that. Are you ready> You just prompted me? This is great. Yeah. So this is about what kind of food are Newsboys eating in the mid to late 19 century, and how are people feeling about it  . “Each city had its specialties. Newsboys in Philadelphia were notably fond of clam soup, cheesecake, and mint sticks. Some skeptics felt that cravings for dainties, not real hunger, c  aused Newsboys to eat rather than save their earnings.”\\xa0  Mike:   Oh my God.\\xa0  Sarah:   Like, fuck off you guys.\\xa0  Mike:   It’s an early glimpse of all of the moralizing around food that we would all become obsessed with about a hundred years later.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, exactly. Well, here, I'll read you a little more.   “Newspapers themselves offered dining options. The Tribune's basement was home to two eateries. The first, Butter Cake Dicks, was famous not only for its cakes and coffee, but also for its easy credit. The proprietor, Dick Marshall, had a soft heart for busted boys, but little patience for rowdies. The menu included cold pork and beans, cold ham, boiled eggs, rice pudding, and Connecticut pies, most famously pumpkin. Marshall refused on principle to stock graham crackers, which were invented by anti-masturbation campaigner Sylvester Graham, who condemned ‘exciting’ foods such as sweets, meats and coffee.”  That exciting is in quotes because the concept is that it literally excites your body. And Sylvester Graham would tell us that if we all ate bland foods that don't excite our bodies, then we can be celibate. And that's the goal, I guess.\\xa0  Mike:   Isn't that the old quote about puritanism? That it's the fear that someone somewhere is having fun.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. I think puritanism was also about the freedom to execute people with impunity and stuff. But yeah, also that.\\xa0  We are going to do a little bit of art history now. So we're going to talk about two paintings that are featured and   Crying the News  , and both are mid-19th century renderings of the Newsboys. So the first one is   Buffalo Newsboy  , by Thomas Le Clear.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh, look at this little kid. So it's a young man, he's wearing sort of a cowboy-ish hat, he's got a green jacket on and almost like ski boots. Like big, thick, heavy boots. He's sitting on a crate of some kind and he's eating an apple with his left hand. Little southpaw in front of us. And the painter is going out of his way to tell us that this is a newsboy. There's newspapers sort of on the wall behind him. There's a newspaper at his feet. It's just a boy with a lot of news, is basically what I’m seeing.  Sarah:   I love that. A boy and his news. Yeah. And there's something about that that I find really resonant. And this feels like a really lovely, wholesome scene.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. And also, he's eating an apple and not a cronut. So we've got all of our Puritan stuff about eating healthy in there, too.\\xa0  Sarah:   Right. He's not eating an exciting food, so you know he's not going to be masturbating later. Okay.\\xa0  And this is a   1849 Newsboy,   by Frederick R. Spencer. Look at this kid. Don't fuck with this kid, that kid ate a cronut for breakfast and he is not sorry.  Mike:   So this kid looks more sort of rough and tumble than the other kid. He's looking direct to camera with a sort of like, “You looking at me?” type of vibe. He's like a stocky kid. He seems to be layering up quite well. Maybe he's in the Pacific Northwest. And again, we've got a bunch of newsprint on the wall behind him. It's a boy amidst the news.\\xa0  Sarah:   This makes me think of what happens to telephone poles now.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes, it's also so interesting how our relationship with paintings is filtered through our relationship with cameras. Because it looks like this kid is having a photo taken of him, sort of against his will, or he's about to yell at the photographer like, “Hey, what are you doing?” But that's impossible then because they didn't have cameras.\\xa0  Sarah:   You couldn't paint a painting that fast; I’ll tell you that much. That’s a little bit of trivia from someone who's been to grad school. I feel as if these two images kind of depict the two sides of the newsboy coin that people in the adult world are kind of wrestling with throughout the 19th century. At the time that Newsboys were omnipresent, people could not stop complaining about how annoyingly loud they were and how you could not make your way through a city without hearing the deafening call of the newsboy.\\xa0  Mike:   This is also before the invention of the only two things that make being in public bearable, earbuds and Sigur Ros. You couldn't drown out the din of the Newsboys in the way that you could now.  Sarah:   Yeah. And then Newsboys also come to bear the associations that people have with what news media is to become. Because they basically are the messengers, and they get blamed for stuff.\\xa0  The theory I want to advance here is that any time the sort of adults, mass media, the very media being sold by Newsies, is trying to take this attitude of concern about a group in society. Then that suggests a basic fear that they are amassing too much power for two legitimate reasons. Because something that I also find fascinating about Newsboys is that they had political power kind of throughout the sanctuary proceeding the strike. Not a lot, and not in any kind of a centralized way, but like they matter, they were important to the economy that they were working in. And if they refuse to distribute a certain paper that backed a candidate during an election season, then that candidate would suffer. And if they decided to affect an election then they could.  Mike:   Like Facebook, only if you were genocides.\\xa0  Sarah:   So this is   footage   of actual Newsies taken in May 1899.\\xa0  Mike:   I didn't even know they had cameras that early. Amazing.\\xa0  Sarah:   Just barely.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh, no sound though.\\xa0  Sarah:   So it's a New York City street.  Sarah:   There’s a horse drawn cart coming in. That's the newspaper cart.  Mike:   And there's like, all these boys around it.\\xa0  Sarah:   You see one has fell down.  Mike:   He just biffed like Maggie Simpson.\\xa0  Sarah:   That's The World. They're picking up their copies of The World.\\xa0  Mike:   Wow. It's so disorganized.  Sarah:   I know. It was like Fyre Fest.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. They're like kind of pushing and shoving each other.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. Everyone wants to get in first. Yep. That's it. It's very funny to me to see footage of the 19th century.  Mike:   Yeah, it all has that weird sped up, like Charlie Chaplin feel to it. Which of course is not how people moved back then.  Sarah:   No, everyone just walked jerkily at the time.\\xa0  Mike:   But like in my head, The World back then was in black and white and everybody just like walked at this weird joggy frame.\\xa0  Sarah:   Right, right. Yeah. And in the fifties, everything was in really intense colors. And then in the seventies, things were grainy. So this is a song called,   The Boys in the Bowery Pit.   This is a song written for and about the extremely newsboy-dense audience for downtown entertainments in New York City in the late 19th century. Because Newsboys, I mean, in a way they're one of the first youth demographics and they're able to be catered to, because of how much power they have economically, relatively speaking.  There's a lot of media about Newsboys and the 19th century because Newsboys were consuming a lot of media and like to see stories about themselves. Like they read, they went to the theater. We didn't have the word teenager yet, but that's basically what they were, they're 16 or so and under, and they have money to spend. There as free as fishes, it sure beats washing dishes. Ain’t it a fine life.\\xa0  Mike:   And their greatest risk to their mortality is masturbation due to cronuts.\\xa0  Sarah:   Apparently. So here's the song,   The Boys in the Bowery Pit  , which was performed for the Newsies, and to read a claim by the Newsies, I think, because it was about them.  “I'm sitting in the Bowery it amongst the Gallus boys.”   Gallus means like brazenly adventurous.   “The Gallus boys are wide awake. They know what's coming now. For J.R. Scott is coming on and then there's such a row. Just at this time, a little boy climbs up upon his seat. And one behind who cannot see soon, knocks him off his feet.  A cry of “pass him round” then is echoed through the pit. And ground and lofty tumbling in no circumstance to it.”  Mike:   Roses are red, Newsboys drink ale. This will soon be a musical, starring a young Christian Bale.\\xa0  Sarah:   Ahhh! That was so good. Oh my God.  Mike:   I think I fucked up some of the syllables. You get the idea.\\xa0  Sarah:   Ok, Michelle.\\xa0  Mike:   That's the cruelest thing you could possibly say to me about my rhymes.\\xa0  Sarah:   No it’s not. Because you improvised poetry. It’s very hard to do.\\xa0  So this lovely poem/song brings us back to what I think of when I'm told about Newsies going to see nightly entertainment, which is the Newsies strike rally at New Irving Hall on Broome Street, which is also featured in the movie   Newsies  . Would you like to see it?\\xa0  Mike:   God, I forgot that there was a movie based on all this stuff. I got lost in the history, Sarah, I'm sorry.  Sarah:   I know. Isn't it great? I think we're selling ourselves short if we just think that it's wonderful enough that there's one movie all about newsboys. I think there should be a lot of movies about newsboys.  Mike:   Yeah. It's funny. I was just thinking, man, somebody should make a movie about this. And then I remembered what we're doing here today.\\xa0  Sarah:   So I'm going to show you a video called, Spot Conlon Moments x3. The description says, “sorry, it's kind of poor quality because the clips are from my phone, but there aren’t many videos of Spot Conlon moments.” So I'm giving you that authentic experience. I'm excited. I've chosen to be excited about it. So I'm going to send this to you.  Mike:   I have no idea what I'm about to get into.\\xa0  Sarah:   Thank you, Olivia. Thank you for uploading this video seven years ago. Spot Conlon, you might recall, was the leader of the Brooklyn contingent of the newsboys.  Mike:   Yes.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. You haven't forgotten Spot Conlon. \\xa0  Mike:   God, these fucking names. It's like Newsboys and Twitch streamers have the most strict naming conventions. This looks like shit.\\xa0  Sarah:   It's going to be great. This is what the situation is, Disney. Stop hiding your light under a bushel.\\xa0  Mike:   Okay, here we go. Three, two, one, go.\\xa0  *Audio plays*  “Well, we started the strike, but we can't do it alone. So we've been talking to other newsies all around the city.\\xa0  So they told, what did they tell you?\\xa0  They're waiting to see what Spot Conlon says. You're the key. That Spot Conlon is the most respected and famous newsie in all of New York, and probably everywhere else. And if Spot Conlon joins the strike, then we'll join it, and it will be unstoppable. So you gotta join us because, you gotta.\\xa0  You're right, Jack. I got brains, too, and more than just half of them. How do I know you punks won’t run the first time some goon comes at you at the corner?\\xa0 How do I know you got what it takes to win?”  Mike:   Poor Christian Bale. He had to do this weird accent and he didn't even get to do anything weird with his body.  Sarah:   Maybe it's, I think it's good he didn't do that when he was a growing boy.  Mike:   That's his dream.\\xa0  Sarah:   Not since   Good Fellas   have a bunch of New York accents had this much chemistry with each other.\\xa0  Mike:   Seriously. Also they've got Christian Bale like that little hankie. He looks like a golden retriever. Yeah. It has like a nice Teen Beat kind of feel. Everybody seems non-threatening.\\xa0  Sarah:   It’s because they're wearing 1899 clothes.  Mike:   That's true.\\xa0  Sarah:   This movie is so good.\\xa0  Mike:   And they keep saying “goon”.  Sarah:   A scab.\\xa0  Mike:   I cannot believe this is a fucking Disney movie and you’re saying the word “scabs” to me.  Sarah:   The 90’s had some good stuff in there. Because seriously. Okay. So let's rewind. We've just had a journey Mike, you and I, because I showed you this video. Which is Spot Conlon moments, compiled by a Newsies fan and put on YouTube. And so what that means is that we open with the strike basically starting to get underway and the lower Manhattan Newsies venturing into Brooklyn to make a crucial alliance with Spot Conlon. And like, can you tell us what that scene feels like? Because I feel like the appeal of Newsies to me is very wrapped up in that scene individually.\\xa0  Mike:   Well, it's hard to say because first of all, I couldn't hear a lot of the dialogue. Secondly, it wasn't totally clear to me what the context was. It seems like there were sort of different gangs, I guess, of Newsies. And he didn't want to join up with them because they're like different or whatever.\\xa0  Sarah:   He sticks his neck out for no man. I think the feeling is just that like, if you're going to join a strike, you'd better be sure about it.  Mike:   That actually makes sense because on some level, because each of the Newsboys is an independent contractor, they're kind of in competition with each other. That if somebody else on a different corner sells all of his papes, those are papes that I'm not selling.\\xa0  Sarah;   I love how much you love to say ‘papes’, because I love to say ‘papes’.\\xa0  Mike:   But yeah, it isn't an industry structured to breed solidarity, which means that the solidarity that they formed is even more impressive.  24:31     Sarah:  \\xa0 Yeah. So back to the actual Newsboys strike. So we have the initial action in Long Island City. We have the meeting downtown in City Hall Park on July 19, and the decision to strike if the price isn't rolled back to $0.50 per a hundred papers. And the quote they get back from the world is, “Go ahead and strike.” So they do.\\xa0  And this is when they decide to organize themselves the way that regular adult unions are organized. They send delegates to different neighborhoods. They do the kind of stuff that we see represented in Newsies, where they're paying attention to the politicking and setting up some kind of infrastructure for this movement, and also developing alliances with other cities. There's strikes in Massachusetts, there's strikes in New Jersey. And these boys have also had other strikes in the 1890s and before. Like this is a very strikey time.\\xa0  So in real life, the primary leader sort of figurehead apparently for the strike is not Christian Bale, it's Kid Blink, whose real name is Louis Baletti. And Kid Blink is a real character in Newsies, but he's a side guy who's just sort of mostly, you know, he's there. And a kid named Dave Simons, who I must presume our pal David from Newsies is based on. And they're both 18 years old. A lot of the other Newsies in leadership positions are in their mid-teens. The adult unions are paying attention. During the strike, the socialist labor party has a candidate for governor who says, “  The capitalist class may well look to their defenses when five- and ten-year-old boys go out on strike against their infernal system.”   So I feel like there's this, this feeling among adults watching this, that, you know, maybe these boys that we feared are also capable of creating the society that we've all been incapable of creating. We're not doing it.\\xa0  Mike:   Good marketing. Little kids fighting back against the system. I mean, it's a good story.  Sarah:   but yeah, a lot of people were on the side of the kids. And I do feel like more is possible when people are really hit over the head by the sort of moral clarity present in a struggle that is standing for other struggles that are maybe less advertisable. The fact that there's so much reporting on the newsboy strike in other newspapers at the time is also really interesting. Newsies also depicts accurately the fact that newspapers back off of this coverage after a time because the strike is starting to seem serious enough that it seems like it is threatening capital.  So on the 22nd, Hearst himself is spotted by the Newsies attempting to buy a paper in Herald Square, and basically, they chase him away. And then a bunch of Newsies also wait for Hearst in front of the Journal building. And when Hearst pulls up, they send out apparently one of the cuter Newsboys who says,   “We're the strikers, Mr. Hearst. We want 100 papers for 50 cents. We get it from the other papers except The World.”   And so he invites the Newsies up to come discuss it with him. And so Kid Blink, Dave, and a couple of other delegates come up and talk with him. So here's what Kid Blinks says about the meeting when he describes it to the other Newsies;  “He wanted to know what The World is going to do. I told him that we was dealing with The Journal now, and that if he cut, The World would cut quick enough. He says he had to talk it over with some other guys before he gives an answer. And I then asked him if he would arbitrate, like his paper says. He laughed and said he'd give us an answer Monday right here.  And so on Monday, The Journal and The World hire scabs and pay them $2 a day to sell newspapers. So that's their negotiation. Good job.\\xa0  Mike:   That's their   Empire Strike Back   move.\\xa0  Sarah:   It speaks to the idea that they're not taking these kids seriously. They're pretending to and hoping that's enough, and then deciding to crush them with scabs.  So following this, they have their Irving Hall rally, where they discuss what are they going to agree on that they will and won't do. Which includes Kid Blink telling everyone, “A fellow can't soak a lady.”  Mike:   What does that mean?\\xa0  Sarah:   Soaking means beating someone up.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh yeah, don't do that.\\xa0  Sarah:   And this is given after, according to one newspaper, an old lady has been selling newspapers and breaking the strike by doing so. And are harassed by Newsies that take off her blouse and skirt, and then hoist them atop the flagpole and wave them around.  Mike:   That’s horrible, someone explain labor rights to her.\\xa0  Sarah:   And at the Irving Hall event where he says, “Ain't that 10 cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer who are millionaires?” Kid Blink wins best speech, and he gets one of those flower horse shoes that they have at the racetrack, I guess.\\xa0  Mike:   What? So it's like a Miss America situation. People are getting awards.  Sarah:   At least Kid Blink is. Yeah.\\xa0  Mike:   Funniest, best hair, most romantic.\\xa0  Sarah:   The homecoming strike rally. Yeah. And in Newsies this scene as a real turning point because the sort of dramatic action for Christian Bale's character is that he escaped from the house of refuge. Which is a real place where “juvenile delinquents” were sent in New York City at the time and were basically you were given hard labor to do. Because selling newspapers is bad, and doing hard labor is good for children.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. Then as now.  Sarah;   Yeah. But in real life the rally is this lovely occasion where obviously it's going on and there's a lot of controversy. And it's hard to decide the soaking women issue, perhaps for some I imagine, but in the movie, this is where the police come and do a big raid and arrest everybody and put the vice on the Newsboys and take Jack Kelly back to the house of refuge.\\xa0  Mike:   But does this happen in real life? Are they raided in real life?\\xa0  Sarah:   It does not happen in real life. And the fact about the Newsboys strike that I think the movie Newsies had the hardest time digesting, is that Hearst and Pulitzer attempted to and appeared to have been successful in their attempt to buy out Kid Blink and David Simons.  Mike:   Oh, wait…so they paid off the strike organizers?\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. So in real life, the rally goes great. There's 5,000 Newsboys there. The strike is apparently growing stronger. And Hearst and Pulitzer pay $300 and $600 to Kid Blink and David Simons to get them to call a truce and call them, get a ‘do over’, stop the strike.  And so on July 26, they go to talk to the other Newsies about it. And Kid Blink, according to the news sported a new suit of clothes complete with straw hat and russet shoes and unwisely flashed a roll of bills. The strike committee put the pair on trial for high treason and low bribery. Kid Blink eloquently maintained their innocence. Both escaped conviction but were removed from office. A mob of Newsboys chase Blink through the streets that night. He escaped only by getting himself arrested.\\xa0  Mike:   Wow. That's a very sad ending to the story.\\xa0  Sarah:   This is not the end yet. Don't worry.\\xa0  Mike:   Okay. That's a very sad Act Three twist to the story.\\xa0  Sarah:   And in the movie we got the scenario where like he’s Jack Kelly, he's escaped the house of refuge, the stakes are really high. His dream is to get to Santa Fe, which is also a theme in the life of real Newsboys, that they can reasonably save up a relatively small amount of money and head west for a job in farming or buy land eventually and set themselves up as farmers. Which a fair number of Newsboys did over time. So the dream of going west is very real.\\xa0  And so he allows himself to be bought off for like one second, and then he turns back around, and they do the banner together and they print the newsletter that's going to turn everything around. And everything's great and he doesn't get case down the street.  Mike:   Right. That's the Disney version of this, where he flirts with temptation, but ultimately doesn't give in.\\xa0  Sarah:   It is, yeah. And let me actually, I have a thing to say about Newsies and money. So in 1875, Louisa May Alcott went to see the Newsboys lodging house in New York City, and she wrote a letter to her nephews about it.  Mike:   Wow.\\xa0  Sarah:   Can you tell from the way I'm saying this, this is the most exciting piece of literature I could imagine coming across in my entire life? Louisa May Alcott, Newsboys.  Mike:   All you need is a serial killer in there and you're set.\\xa0  Sarah:   This tells us a little bit about the indoor cats of the Newsboys. The indoor/outdoor Newsboys were living at the time, because a lot of Newsboys didn't stay in the lodging houses. I mean really the majority did not, but it was an institution that was available for the latter half of the 19th century.  I'll start us with her noticing,   “One little chap, only six. He was trotting around as busy as a bee, locking up his small shoes and ragged jacket as if they were great treasures. I asked about little Pete and the man told us his brother, only nine, supported him and took care of him entirely. And wouldn't let Pete be sent away to any home because he wished to have his family with him. How would it seem to be all alone in a big city with no mama to cuddle, you know, to grandpa's houses, to take you in not a penny, but what you earned and Donnie to take care of. Could you do it? Nine-year-old Patsy, does it capitally. Buys Pete’s clothes, pays for his bed and supper, and puts pennies in the savings bank. The savings bank was a great table, all full of slits, each one leading to a little place below and numbered outside, so each boy knew his own. One boy was putting in some pennies as we looked, and I asked how much he had saved this month. ‘$14. Ma'am’, says the 13-year-old, proudly slipping in the last cent. A prize of $3 is offered to the lad who saves the most in a month, and they also offer interest.”  \\xa0  So yeah, I think that is very interesting that like there is within this culture where the perennial fear is that they're buying sweets, and exciting themselves with exciting foods, and they're smoking cigars, and they're seeing shows. But there's also this apparently pretty strong culture of saving that's actually encouraged by the institutions that they're a part of.  Mike:   So if that kid was saving $14 bucks a month, then Kid Blink’s $300 bucks a month, it’s like a shitload of money.  Sarah:   $14 bucks a month for 12 months, so like two years, basically.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. So no wonder they took it.  Sarah:   Yeah. I mean they're kids. When are they ever going to see a $600? This actually reminds me of an area that I'd also wanted to touch on. Which is the eternal question for me and others in the fandom, were there girl Newsies? And the answer that Vincent DiGirolamo has in   Crying the News   is,   “Yes. But everyone was scared of them and terrorized them all the time.”  Mike:   Wait, what? Why?  Sarah:   Okay. So here's a quote from Grover Cleveland, of all people.   “No pretext should be permitted to excuse allowing young girls to be on the streets at improper hours, since the result must necessarily be their destruction.”  Mike:   Oh, is it like a moral turpitude thing?\\xa0  Sarah:   Yes.\\xa0  Mike:   Like they're going to get tempted by drugs and candy sweets.  Sarah:   I mean basically the idea that people keep bringing up in this way that doesn't completely make sense is like, if a girl is a Newsie, then it's like, that's a gateway drug to sex work, basically.  Another quote, this is from a New York Police Captain,   “Girls who begin with selling newspapers usually end with selling themselves.”  Mike:   Oh God. Yeah. I mean, I guess like you said, it's independence. They can do what they want with their time and with their physical selves, and they can be in whatever part of the city they want to be in. And yeah. That's a slippery slope to a sex work, I suppose.\\xa0  Sarah:   Newspapers, donuts, vice. Basically we all know that. I guess we need to associate newspapers with immorality again. I think that's another thing that would really help.  Mike:   The people who host the show already do, Sarah. We’re there.  Sarah:   Yeah, I guess I think the idea is that if you empower a girl to sell anything, then she is going to become scarily powerful.\\xa0  So the day after Kid blink and David are found not guilty of treason, but booted from the union, The World and Journal offer to make a compromise and sell at $0.55 cents per hundred. And in these ways, [inaudible] says no. But they're starting to lose steam. And it's hard to say how significant the loss of their leader’s spokes boys was, but when the papers come back again two days later, July 29t and say we're going to stay at the current price, but you can return your unsold papers to us and we're going to refund you for them. Okay.\\xa0  Mike:   That's great. Because that completely changes the risk calculus.\\xa0  Sarah:   It does. Yeah. I think it is a victory, and the strike ends on August 1st.\\xa0  Mike:   So ultimately it was roughly two weeks.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, a little less than two weeks. It's like uncommon.\\xa0  Mike:   It's like a Baker's fortnight. I don't know what that means.\\xa0  Sarah:   And after that, the Newsboys union goes on, but it becomes something with adult leadership, and it is basically no longer in the Newsboys hands and the way that it was. And actually this kind of connects to my feelings of ambivalence about the ending of Newsies. In the movie, as you and I both observed, all of these boys are having tons of chemistry with each other. And it's the kind of thing that if you like to ship couples as a teenager watching media, there's a lot of material there.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah, this is a ship factory. Ships coming off, the conveyor belt.  Sarah:   Was this movie made on the Great Lakes? Because it's a ship factory. And of course my ship, because I'm not that creative, is Jack and David. And at the end of the movie they resolve this plot line where Jack kind of joins David's family the first day that David works as a Newsie and comes in and meets David's parents and his sisters Sarah. And Jack and Sarah have “chemistry”, but they don't, because she's the only girl in the movie. And it's a movie that is obsessed with the joyful chemistry of boys having a strike.\\xa0  And so at the end of the movie, the strike ends. They don't do the $0.60 cents and return paper thing. And then the papers decided that they would agree to the initial demand, and then the strike ended, and it was wonderful. And then Jack kisses Sarah. The End. And Spot Conlon rode off in Teddy Roosevelt's carriage. And Teddy Roosevelt is in it, by the way. There's a plot point where like they called Teddy Roosevelt and he's like, “This is terrible. We can't let children suffer this way”. Which   Crying The News   points out is probably inaccurate because Teddy Roosevelt advocated shooting strikers.\\xa0  Mike:   So that's the Inglorious Basterds killing Hitler. They just put in a wish in the middle of the movie. It’s fine.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. Yeah. That's the most brazen inaccuracy. But yeah, and I think that ending is sort of weirdly bittersweet in the way that the actual ending of the strike is. Where it's like there was this moment when the strike was going on where anything was possible. And like maybe kid workers will rise together in solidarity and form their own kid workers union, like the IWW, but the kid workers of the world. And it won't be led by adults. And like what can happen when children are empowered to represent themselves? And what if the Newsboys have such power over these newspaper tycoons in such a shocking way that these tycoons failed to see coming at all. Like what if, what if that kind of power can be on earth in other fields? Never mind, it's over. Kiss a girl.\\xa0  Mike:   I mean, it's like, I mean, I guess this happens a lot with these things that sort of reality comes bursting in like the Kool-Aid man. Ultimately, it's like, oh, the reality of it is just it's going to be a lot easier if we do this other thing, just less cool.  Sarah:   Yeah. I feel like this is sort of a growing up story, too. Because like the dream that you have as a child is that you make your demand and then the newspaper company is like, “Yes, I will meet your demand. We've had a struggle for about an hour and a half. I don't think I'm going to win this one. You can have the exact thing you asked for.” And in real life, you know, it's a really good outcome for you to ask for something and not get that specific thing but get something else that functionally gives you more security. And maybe it doesn't mean that you've won in the way that you might've hoped to win. And you reached a compromise, and you can move forward with your life.  Where we get stuck sometimes is feeling like if you don't get exactly what you would have initially hoped for at your most idealistic, then it's just not worth it. Which I feel like is this kind of like nineties liberalism sense of residedness that we talked about growing up with and around in the previous episode of like, “Unions don't work, kids. Kid Blink got bought out. Give it up, party's over.” And it's like, I don't think that something being spectacularly effective for a brief period, and then kind of crashing and burning, means that all effective things crash and burn. It means that it takes practice to move a movement forward. And that children representing themselves and anyone who represents the actual people whose conditions they're speaking about, seem to do well and seem to generate solidarity. At least in this instance. There’s nothing like solidarity. And like the fact that it is difficult and fleeting to cultivate doesn't mean that it's not worth it because,   “Every pape you tear out of a scab’s hands is worth something.”  Mike:     There's also the sort of overall context of the country in that there were a lot of desperately poor children who were willing to replace these laborers. I mean, this is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to get independent unions going in sweat shops. Because oftentimes they're an extremely poor countries where there really are a lot of desperate people who will work for low, shitty wages. Because that's the only option that's available.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. And also that they had this unusual situation where they were able to generate the kind of income that allowed them to strike, that they weren't all living hand to mouth. A lot of them were, but some of them weren't. And that freedom within an industry to perhaps get a little bit ahead, to get a little bit of a savings, even if you're living in a lodging house and considering yourself lucky to get a bath for free, you can still save up a little bit. Like if you are treated with a little bit of decency as a worker and are given some rights, then it makes it easier to demand more rights. Because like, if you have the energy to organize, then like, you will.  Mike:   Right. It's like how if one person learns a song and then another person learns it, and then they learn the choreography. And pretty soon everyone is dancing together.\\xa0  Sarah:   And then Mike watches Newsies all the way through if he wants to. Not if it’s too awkward though. It's fine.\\xa0  Mike:   That's what this was all leading up to, obviously.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. Maybe we can, you know, some dreams are out of bounds, but my dream of more people watching Newsies is possible.\\xa0  I have one last journey to take you on.\\xa0  Mike:   Oooh, take me.\\xa0  Sarah:   Okay. So if this isn't too awkward for you, then nothing in Newsies will be. But we are going to watch Christian Bale's big song in this movie, which he I think worked so hard to sing and to dance to. And this show is about applauding people who do their best. So we're going to watch,   Santa Fe  .\\xa0  Mike:   All right. Three, two, one, go.\\xa0  *video plays*  “So that's what they call a family, mother daughter, father, son. I guess that everything you heard about is true.”  Mike:   This is very Disney.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, it's the “I want” song.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. He's laying out his feelings.\\xa0  Sarah:   It's also unfortunate that I think behind the scenes, they were like, “Christian, we have to get you looking as greasy as we can at all times. We want you sweating. We want you greasy.\\xa0  Mike:   He's real wet.\\xa0  “When I dream, on my own, I'm alone, but I ain't lonely. For a dreamer night’s the only time of day.”  Sarah:   He has the expression of a kid at sleepaway camp who wasn't told it was going to be for eight weeks.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. He probably smells like Welsh cliffs, all the salt coming out of him.  Sarah:   They’re trying to get him to smell like cigarettes, but he just smells like a Welsh Merman.\\xa0  “It's a feeling time can never take way. All I needs a few more dollars, and I'm outta here to stay. Dreams come true. Yes, they do.”  Sarah:   Oh God. I cannot believe they did this to him. Like adults all got in a room to edit this and felt okay going home to their families at the end of the day.\\xa0  Mike:   I cannot believe he didn't know he was going to have to do this only.\\xa0  Sarah:   If only he had a union to protect him. He does great though, right? Like this is hard.  Mike:   He seems like a guy that puts his all into everything.\\xa0  Sarah:   Oh yeah. I mean, you can tell right. Because he's always gaining or losing 80 pounds.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. People don't fight for the integrity of a   Terminator Salvation  , unless they take it really serious. Now he's on a fucking horse?\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. He stole that horse. Cause Newsies are ruffians, you know, they'll steal your horse just so they can sing a song on it.\\xa0  Mike:   The only time you ever see empty New York is in movies.  Sarah:   Yeah, when New York is in Burbank.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. That was great. So far, my main takeaway from this movie is the absolute nightmare scenario of getting a job and then being told that you still have to do the job, but you also have to sing. \\xa0  Sarah:   So in conclusion, do your best and be proud of it. We love you, Christian Bale. And maybe the thing about   Newsies   is that it's such a weird movie because it's trying to represent what should be an entire genre of media but isn't yet.\\xa0  Mike:   Newsboy media?  Sarah:   Yes. Newsboy media. There's a whole world out there for us to explore, through all kinds of properties. But yeah, I mean, I guess I feel like dark and a light way to look at this, right. And to me, the dark way is like, oh my God, like we've gone backwards. And like this kind of worker solidarity seems harder to cultivate in American now than it did then, even though we're living in tomorrow land. Like, ugh.\\xa0  But on the other hand, you give some teenage boys a place to sleep for $0.06 cents a night, a hot bath, and a piggy bank, and they threaten to overturn capitalism. So I don't know what would happen if he gave them two baths?  Mike:   And some cronuts.\"]]"

       "'Sarah:   I want to know about prisons and so rather than locking a bunch of guys in my basement, I just read about prisons.  Sarah  : Welcome to   You’re Wrong About,   the show where we teach you how to ruin all of your teacher’s poorly thought out arguments.\\xa0  Mike  : Oooh.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ahhh.\\xa0  Mike:   That is very broad and very good.\\xa0  Sarah  : Thank you. Well, I think it applies specifically well to easily debunkable sociological phenomena of mid sanctuary America.  Mike  : The term that I keep coming across in the literature is self debunking.  Sarah  : Oooh.  Mike  : I am Michael Hobbes. I\\'m a reporter for the   Huffington Post  .\\xa0  Sarah  : I’m Sarah Marshall and I\\'m working on a book about the satanic panic.\\xa0  Mike  : And if you\\'d like to support the show and hear cute bonus episodes about season four of   The Crown   among other things. You can support us on Patreon at   patreon.com/youre wrong  \\xa0about  .\\xa0  Sarah  : Ya.\\xa0  Mike  : And today we are talking about the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Sarah  : I’m so excited. You have no idea.\\xa0  Mike  : Oh my God. Me too.  Sarah  : This is the lowest hanging fruit.\\xa0  Mike:   I know.\\xa0  Sarah  : That we have plucked in a while. Like it was hanging there, just this perfect thing. It\\'s like it\\'s this thing that people cite all the time when they want to make a facile case for why humans are terrible and you should just give up on caring about humans or expecting prosocial behavior. And it just seems like the kind of thing that it is so easily debunked.\\xa0  Mike  : It is self-raising debunking. I was going to do a whole thing where I was going to spend like 20 or 30 minutes walking you through the study step-by-step and really like convincing you that the study was real and then I was going to have like, boom, a twist.  Sarah  : Yeah, you love fucking with me don’t you?\\xa0  Mike  : I know, I do but then I realized you cannot describe this study without getting into the ways in which it is bullshit. But this is also a weird debunking because like what actually happened in the Stanford Prison Experiment is actually mostly true. We\\'re going to get into the various like documents that were faked and stuff that didn\\'t hold up over time. But in general, everything you\\'ve heard about what actually happened in a Stanford basement in August of 1971, that occurred, where the debunking comes in is how to interpret what occurred.\\xa0  Sarah  : Right! This is like Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. It\\'s like everything you saw. It\\'s like, we\\'re not adding anything new to that. It\\'s like, come take my hand. Let\\'s look at it again.\\xa0  Mike  : So Sarah, tell me what you know about the Stanford Prison Experiment. What happened?\\xa0  Sarah:   My basic understanding of it is that there was a study at Stanford by a guy named Zimbardo because a kick ass name.  \\xa0  Mike  : Yes, Phil Zimbardo.\\xa0  Sarah  : Great name, Phil. And basically my understanding of it is that the study shows volunteers I believe from the student body to take on the rules of inmates and guards in a mock prison and half of them were guards and half were inmates. And as the study progressed, the guards began to abuse the inmates. And I believe this was of their own free will and then also that the study was called off early because the situation deteriorated so quickly.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes, it\\'s the story, I think one of the things that has made the story so appealing is this twist in it that like the academics themselves couldn\\'t have predicted how severe it would get.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, it\\'s like the Russian sleep experiment, creepy pasta. It\\'s like, don\\'t try to see the face of God young man.\\xa0  Mike  : One of the main beefs with the Stanford Prison Experiment is how much of a standard in psychology textbooks it is. So one of the first things I did was I found a bunch of textbooks online and I looked at the way that they describe the study.\\xa0  Sarah  : Mmmm, oh I’m so excited for this. This is God, textbook analysis, Mike, this is wonderful.\\xa0  Mike  : So this is an excerpt from a textbook called Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior from 2009.\\xa0 This is I think, emblematic of the way that this study is described, it\\'s described in very sort of cinematic terms. The prison had become a living hell, hidden behind their mirrored sunglasses. The guards asserted their total authority over the prisoners. They made the prisoners ask permission to do virtually anything, including going to the toilet. The guards conducted roll calls in the middle of the night to assert their power and disrupt the prisoners’ sleep. They forced the prisoners to do push ups sometimes with their foot pushing down on the prisoners back. For their part the prisoners became increasingly passive and depressed. They hated the guards but were powerless against them.\\xa0 After a few days, one prisoner cracked emotionally. But this prison was not in some brutal dictatorship. Instead, the prison was in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University and the guards and prisoners were college students who had volunteered for a study of prison life.\\xa0  Sarah  : Leland Stanford\\'s own university. You can tell from that description why this caught on the way that it did. It’s just like it\\'s so you\\'re right, it’s cinematic. And it\\'s like, it just speaks to how textbooks are like magazines in some ways, I guess, and need to have like a cool story with a great hook.  Mike  : Yes, to be fair. I looked at five different textbooks, kind of at random, and all of them did mention weaknesses in the study. So there were none of them that just presented it as like Bible facts and then moved on. All of them said that there were ethical issues. There were sort of methodological issues, but also they mentioned it sort of after these cinematic descriptions of the study. I actually majored in psychology and I remember we talked about the Stanford prison study and we did talk in detail about the weaknesses, but it was always framed as this is a big and influential and important study.\\xa0 And it\\'s not perfect.\\xa0  Sarah  : Right, I feel like one of the problems that you\\'re encountering with that is that like, if the study was so influential and if it influenced our ideas about psychology into from then until now, then to try and throw it out. I feel like there\\'s this fear of like, well, does that invalidate all this other stuff that we\\'ve allowed to influence our culture? And it\\'s like, yeah, maybe.\\xa0  Mike  : So before we get into the debunking and Zimbardo and all of the other stuff that we\\'re going to talk about, I think we should just establish the elements of the story of the Stanford Prison Experiment that have really gotten entrenched. There\\'s basically three components that are central to the way that the experiment is talked about and came up frequently in all of the textbooks that I looked up. The first is that all of the participants in the Stanford Prison Experiment were normal.\\xa0 So this is what Zimbardo says in his 2008 book, the Lucifer Effect, he says “Human nature can be transformed within certain powerful social settings in ways as dramatic as the chemical transformation in the captivating fable of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.” Another thing that we\\'ve sort of forgotten now is that in 1971 when the study was taking place, there was a huge debate within psychology between sort of the personality explains everything people and the situation explains everything people.\\xa0 And this was one of the foundational debates in psychology when this study was designed.\\xa0  Sarah  : I find this so interesting because it\\'s like, why would we waste so much time arguing pointlessly between two extreme positions neither of which are true. Is it A or is it B? It can\\'t be both.\\xa0  Mike  : I mean, any of these foundational debates in any field of science are always so absurd. Like we do this dumb thing with the nature versus nurture thing. Every time some big new study comes out, we\\'re like, it\\'s nature, no it’s\\xa0 nurture when, like it\\'s very obviously a combination of the two.\\xa0  Sarah:   Everything is everything.  \\xa0  Mike  : Yes, so the second major component of the myth of the Stanford Prison Experiment that travels is that the guards were given no instructions. So another piece of context that is really important at this time is that in 1961, Milgram had done his famous obedience experiments. You\\'re familiar with these right?\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, the obedience experiments were done I believe in New Haven. People were brought in and told that they were part of a study that was trying to figure out whether people would learn information and would memorize things better.\\xa0 If they were given an electric shock when they made mistakes and no one was ever actually shocking anyone, but the people thought that they were shocking a real person. And what the study is interpreted as having determined is that people are all too willing to continue administering shocks to people until they appear to have died.  Mike  : Yeah, the story that travels from the Milgram experiments is that people will do almost anything if they\\'re told to do so by a credible authority. Of course, in reality, it wasn\\'t as uniform as that, a lot of people actually didn\\'t continue with the shocks and there\\'s also evidence that people didn\\'t actually think that it was real.\\xa0 And they were like deeply aware that the whole thing was fake and that nobody was actually being killed because that would be bananas. But what\\'s interesting about the Milgram studies is, you know, they were a huge bombshell when they came out and what America took from them was that people will do horrifying things if they are given orders.\\xa0 And what Zimbardo did with the Stanford Prison Experiment is say they will do horrible things even if they\\'re not given orders. Zimbardo\\'s whole thing\\xa0 was you put people in uniforms, you shave their heads, you give the guards mirrored sunglasses, all of these sort of kind of minor seeming or superficial trappings of a system and the guards on their own started treating the prisoners horribly.  Sarah  : This is what I really want to know Mike, why were we so invested in studies that just proved people were horrible?\\xa0  Mike  : Well, honestly this is something I learned in the research for this episode. Was it psychology was in the middle of kind of an existential crisis? Part of it was that, you know, for most of its history, it had been seen as an individual practice, right? It\\'s Freud, it\\'s young, it\\'s people sitting on a couch, it\\'s mostly rich people describing their problems and figuring out like, oh your mom didn\\'t hug you, or she hugged you too much, or whatever.\\xa0  Sarah  : It is Freud offering you a line of blow and talking about your dreams.  Mike  : Right, and then the Holocaust happens. There was this rush to explain what happened. How did an entire country go along with these absolutely horrific acts?\\xa0  Sarah  : I love how we as America have also committed horrific acts during war and it\\'s like, we don\\'t have to look into that at all though, it’s whatever, it\\'s fine.  Mike: There\\'s also, I mean, this doesn\\'t really come up in the literature, but this is like a Michael Hobbs theory. That the 1960s were also a time of white flight. And there was this rush to construct cities, especially the quote unquote inner city with all of the baggage that comes with it as sort of fundamentally violent. Right? This is the time when we got the myth of kitty Genovese. This is the time when we\\'re sort of constructing this myth of the psychopath. There was this rush to imagine human beings that had no empathy.\\xa0  Sarah  : So this is, I\\'m just going to delve into a little cul-de-sac personal theory for a second here.  \\xa0  Mike:   Do it.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Okay, Hervey Cleckley is the mask of sanity, the foundational text and modern psychopaths studies comes out in 1946. Why would Americans want to metabolize? Individual human\\'s ability to commit horrible deeds and perhaps kill lots of lots of people. Why would we want to create a second category of the human? So we don\\'t have to accept that regular people can also murder lots of other human beings and then come home and raise children. Any pot roast, hard to say lets continue.\\xa0  Mike: So the third component of the myth that\\'s really important was that the Stanford Prison Experiment helps explain historical events. So another precursor to the study in 1971 was Hannah Arendt\\'s Eichmann in Jerusalem.  Sarah  : I read this in like my first grade school class, and I remember really liking it, kind of try and remember what it was saying.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes, please do. \\xa0  Sarah:   What the term banality of evil refers to is the concept that outcomes of tremendous evil can be carried out by a bunch of bureaucrats who see themselves as bureaucrats and not as murderers.\\xa0  Mike  : Right!\\xa0 So this is a quote from Eichmann in Jerusalem. “The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic that they were and still are terrifyingly normal. This normality was much more terrifying than all the atrocities put together. It implied that this new type of criminal commits his crime under circumstances that make it well not impossible for him to know or feel that he is doing wrong.”\\xa0 So this is the central banality of evil explanation that it\\'s like a bunch of dudes in suits behind typewriters doing what their bosses tell them in the way that we all do in our jobs, without really thinking about how horrific the acts are right underneath them. \\xa0  And there\\'s quite a bit of debate over whether Hannah Arendt aren\\'t actually believed this. The book itself contains like much more nuanced descriptions, but the fact that this quote appears in Philip Zimbardo’s book, I think is telling because regardless of what her actual book says. This is the idea that most people took away from it. Both Zimbardo and Milgram mentioned the Holocaust constantly throughout their studies. There\\'s like a darkly hilarious passage in the original article where Zimbardo publishes the Stanford Prison Experiment, where he\\'s talking about how the guards, sort of without direction, started making the prisoners do push ups. And then in the next paragraph, he\\'s like, you know, at Auschwitz, the Nazis made the Jews do pushups and you\\'re like.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Come on dude.\\xa0  Mike  : I don\\'t know man.\\xa0  Sarah  : You’re a guy at Stanford. You haven\\'t replicated one of the most incomprehensible atrocities in human history, but like a nice try.\\xa0  Mike  : It just felt to me like some random college freshmen being like, you know, who else was a vegetarian, but this is something that Zimbardo courted explicitly.\\xa0 He also, you know, of course he extends his findings to sort of real prisons, like this says so much about prisons and its the uniforms and its shaving heads, et cetera. He also extends the metaphor of institutions far beyond even like Auschwitz and prisons like the things that it kind of sorta is relevant to.\\xa0 This is what he says in his original study. “The physical institution of prison is, but a concrete and steel metaphor for the existence of more pervasive, albeit less obvious prisons of the mind that all of us daily create, populate and perpetuate.” \\xa0  Sarah  : No!  Mike:   I\\xa0 know he says, uh, yeah. “The social convention of marriage, as one example becomes for many couples, a state of imprisonment in which one partner agrees to be a prisoner or guard. “  Sarah  : You unbelievable Pop-over!\\xa0  Mike  : It’s like put the vape down, Phil, just relax. The sort of the reason I\\'m bringing up all of these myths before we get to the sort of the main content of this episode is because all of these myths form literally days after the experiment happens. He did this study in August of 1971. He, he invites TV reporters to film the study.\\xa0 He sends out a press release on the second day of the study, like he\\'s courting press attention from literally minute one.\\xa0  Sarah  : Nice.\\xa0  Mike  : The study ends on August 20th. On August 21st, there\\'s a prisoner uprising at San Quentin in which a black political prisoner named George Jackson is killed. And it\\'s a huge story. And three weeks later is the Attica uprising in New York, which is partly in response to George Jackson being killed in San Quentin. So basically the minute that Zimbardo is done doing his study, we are engaged in a month long nationwide debate over prison conditions.   Sarah:   That is interesting.\\xa0  Mike  : In October of 1971, Congress holds all these hearings about Attica and about prison conditions and they asked Zimbardo to appear and testify.  Sarah  : What?\\xa0  Mike:   Yes.  \\xa0  Sarah  : What? They’re like, hey, you hang out with a bunch of guys one time, come talk about the very real conditions of this very real prison.\\xa0  Mike  : And then in November, one month later, there\\'s a 20 minute prime time special on NBC, exclusively dedicated to the Stanford Prison Experiment.\\xa0  Sarah  : God, academia used to be different.\\xa0  Mike  : I know, man. And then this is incredible.\\xa0 The academic study of Stanford Prison Experiment. Zimbardo doesn\\'t get his shit together and get all the data and, you know, get through peer review and everything until 1973.\\xa0  Sarah  : That\\'s a man after my own heart.\\xa0  Mike  : I know.\\xa0  Sarah  : I like to put it in a drawer and then he gets really into wind surfing.\\xa0  Mike  : But so what that does is it creates this two year long period where the myth of the Stanford Prison Experiment is able to metastasize. \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah\\xa0  Mike  : Without any rigorous peer review data about the study.\\xa0  Sarah:   So let\\'s not give people ideas, but apparently you can start a study, have a bunch of press about what you think the results are gonna be and then neglect to actually complete it for years.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : Cool.\\xa0  Mike  : The myth is already out in the wild while this dumb academic paper was tying its shoes.\\xa0  Sarah  : In conclusion, people are bad and marriage is worse.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Thank you for reading my study.  Mike  : So uh now we are going to talk a little bit about Phil Zimbardo. \\xa0  Sarah:  Cool, I’m excited.\\xa0  Mike  : I am going\\xa0 to read you something and you have to tell me where you think it is from.   Sarah  : Ok.  \\xa0  Mike:   In 1969, Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist arranged to have an automobile without license plates parked with its hood up on a street in the Bronx and a comparable automobile on a street in Palo Alto, California. The car in the Bronx was attacked by vandals within 10 minutes.\\xa0 The first to arrive was a family, father, mother and young son who removed the radiator and battery. Within 24 hours virtually everything of value had been removed. Then random destruction began, windows were smashed, parts torn off, upholstery ripped. Children began to use the car as a playground. Most of the adult vandals were well dressed, apparently clean cut whites.\\xa0  Sarah  : Hmm.\\xa0  Mike  : The car in Palo Alto by contrast sat untouched for more than a week. Then Zimbardo smashes part of it with a sledge hammer, soon passersby were joining in and within a few hours, the car had been turned upside down and utterly destroyed. Again, the vandals appeared to be primarily respectable whites. Where do you think this is from?\\xa0   Sarah  :   Time Magazine  ?\\xa0  Mike  : Ooh,Close. \\xa0  Sarah  :   Life  ?\\xa0  Mike  : It is from   The Atlantic  , from the 1982 article that kicked off the broken windows policing trend.   \\xa0  Sarah  : Zimbardooooo!! \\xa0  Mike  : Yes, so he is the god father of not one but two trash concepts that have taken over American life.\\xa0  Sarah  : Its so stupid, its like ok ,so\\xa0 you put one car in one place on one day and one car in another place on one day and then your wrote down what happend and like how many other cars were there. \\xa0  Mike  : Right.\\xa0  Sarah  : Like how much has this been massaged by you and then by the reporter into something that sounds like compelling to readers. It\\'s a cool magazine lead, I don\\'t find it trustworthy because for one thing they share lack of detail.\\xa0  Mike  : Totally. And first of all the Bronx stuff there is no evidence for this by the way\\xa0 but it sounds\\xa0 fucking fake to me. The idea that you park a car with its hood up with nothing else wrong with it and literally within minutes people are like stripping it for parts. In another article Zimbardo describes they were urinating on the car.\\xa0  Sarah  : It’s interesting that this is middle of the day and you just imagine like one like white guy in a suit walking up and he’s like ah I’m going to smash this car I think.\\xa0  Mike  : He’s like fuck this car.\\xa0  Sarah  : And then one by one more and more snazzy white people come up. \\xa0 I’ve never seen that, I’m not saying it couldn\\'t happen but like it is weird and hard to imagine.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah so one thing that is interesting about this is Zimbardo never set out to have anything to do with the broken windows theory - like this wasn’t, this didn’t exist in 1969 when he did this experiment. What he was actually doing was putting the car in these two different cities to make an argument about cities.\\xa0 Because a big thing in sorta situational list thinking at the time was the idea at the time that cities are crime ridden hell holes because of deindividualization, that you become less of an individual in a city, you become more anonymized and so therefore you’re willing to carry out more and more quote on quote“psychopathic behaviors” because you know you are never going to be held accountable.\\xa0  Sarah  : Hmm.  Mike  : So you will love this, in his book. He begins a chapter about this with the story of a young woman named Kitty Genovese.\\xa0  Sarah  : I’ve heard of this young lady.  Mike  : So as listeners will know, this is the myth of this woman who was stabbed in an apartment courtyard in front of 38 of her neighbors and none of them called 911. Literally none of those details are true. Like it wasn\\'t 38 people. It wasn\\'t in an apartment courtyard. People did call the police, 911 did not exist at the time. So that is why people did not call it.   Sarah  : And one of the tragedies of this way that we have making allegories that suit our emotional needs out of real people\\'s lives is that they get forgotten and one of the things we talk about is that Kitty Genovese was a lesbian\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. \\xa0  Sarah  : And one of the reasons that one of the most proximate witnesses didn\\'t call the cops potentially was that he was gay and understood that the NYPD would probably mistreat him horribly because that was how they related to gay people.  Mike  : Right.\\xa0  Sarah  : And to make the behaviors of any small group of people, somehow predictive of humanity for the next 50 to 60 years. Like it\\'s never going to work. So why do that to people?\\xa0  Mike  : Right, so he’s writing this in 2008 and he just quotes with no caveats, the first paragraph of the infamous New York times story that says like 38 people watch a woman get killed, blah, blah, blah.\\xa0  Sarah  : Mmmhmm  Mike  : And then he says a recent re-analysis of the details of this case cast doubt upon how many people actually saw the events unfolding and whether they really comprehended what was happening.\\xa0 Nevertheless, there seems to be no question that many residents of this well-kept, usually quiet, almost suburban neighborhood, heard the chilling screams and did not help in any way.\\xa0  Sarah  : The chilling screams my quick shelling screens.\\xa0  Mike  : I just want that nevertheless, to be in like point 50 font, like it\\'s doing a lot of work.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah. Oh my God. Nevertheless, you know, it was like the Dutch boy holding this whole book together.  Mike  : But this to me encapsulates the way that he discusses his own academic work and other people\\'s academic work.\\xa0 You know, he\\'s going to tell you a story and then he\\'s like, well, maybe the story isn\\'t true at all, all of the premises in it are bullshit.\\xa0  Sarah and Mike  : Nevertheless. \\xa0  Mike  :\\xa0 I\\'m just going to make the same point. And so the whole thing of the car that he parked in Palo Alto and it sat there until Zimbardo came along and broke one of its windows and then all of a sudden, all these other people started destroying the car. The quote unquote passers by who destroyed the car were Zimbardo\\'s graduate students.   Sarah  : Well, I just feel like that might have bearing on the study.\\xa0  Mike  : Seems relevant. So basically they parked a car in a random street in Palo Alto for a week. Nothing happened then a week later, they parked the same car on campus at Stanford. Another week goes by nobody does anything. Zimbardo was like, ah, nothing\\'s happening. So he goes out there with a sledgehammer and like five of his students \\xa0  Sarah  : Wow! \\xa0  Mik  e: And they all start destroying the car sort of in public, like it\\'s a walkable area and people are around.\\xa0  Sarah  : It\\'s very interesting that he\\'s invested in the premise that like well-dressed white people just want to beat up cars. Cause it\\'s like, maybe you want to do that, man.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : And you\\'re the well-dressed white guy you\\'re talking about, that\\'s fine.\\xa0  Mike  : And he makes a big deal out of the fact that like eventually other Stanford students joined in, I was like, well, yeah, if there\\'s eight people destroying a car on campus and they\\'re like offering me the sledgehammer like, yeah, I\\'ll take a couple whacks, but that doesn\\'t say anything about human nature. Like aren\\'t we all subject to evil, like, not really man.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, I mean, it looks, I\\'m sure it would look fun. Why not? I am the well-dressed white person you fear Philip Zombardo. I\\'m not well-dressed though. I look awful.\\xa0  Mike  : So this stuff on some level, is not necessarily Zimbardo\\'s fault because it\\'s the authors of the broken windows study that sort of take his work and twist it to their weird broken windows theory thing. But then in 2008 in Zimbardo\\'s book, he retells the story of this experiment and comes to the opposite conclusion.\\xa0  Sarah  : Hmm\\xa0  Mike  : So, the myth of the original park a car in two places study is the idea that people in the Bronx and people in Palo Alto are subject to the same forces.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, well-dressed white people want to assault cars.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes, exactly. So, yeah he retells the story in his 2008 book where he says, we parked it in the Bronx, it got destroyed. We parked it in Palo Alto and nobody touched it for a week. And then he completely deletes the part where he parks it on the Stanford campus and they destroy it.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ahhh. \\xa0  Mike  : And then he uses that to make an argument about the difference between Bronx and Palo Alto.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Nooo!   \\xa0  Mike  : So listen to this fucking paragraph. It drives me insane.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ok.\\xa0  Mike  : He says community spirit thrives in a quiet, orderly way in places such as Palo Alto.\\xa0  Sarah  : No it doesn’t.\\xa0  Mike  : I know where people care about the physical and social quality of their lives and have the resources to work at improving both.\\xa0  Sarah  : Gross. \\xa0  Mike  : Here in Palo Alto, there is a sense of fairness and trust that contrasts with the nagging tugs of inequity and cynicism that dragged down folks in other places. Here, for example, people have faith in their police department to control crime and contain evil.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ahhhhhhh!\\xa0 \\xa0  Mike  : You’re going to love this - justifiably so because the police are well-educated, well-trained, friendly and honest. \\xa0 At rare times, even the best of them can let authority rule over their humanity. That doesn\\'t happen often in a place like Palo Alto.  Sarah  : This is like the point at which I don\\'t know what the academic equivalent of this is. It\\'s just like, okay, here\\'s your coat because you have to leave this party now.\\xa0  Mike  :\\xa0 I mean, I think what really explains a lot of Zimbardo\\'s problems is that he\\'s kind of an SJW.\\xa0 \\xa0  Sarah  : A single Jewish woman.\\xa0  Mike  : No, uh, he\\'s definitely a social justice warrior, but he has this very like sixties version of a social justice warrior. Right, so he talks about how he\\'s against the Vietnam war. He\\'s for, you know, integration, civil rights. Some of his early work is actually about coerced confessions. So to give him credit, like nobody was talking about coerced confessions back then.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah,\\xa0 I take back 20% of my sassy notes.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah, but then he also, for a guy that studies prisons he also seems really naive about power relations.  \\xa0  Sarah  : He is interested in well-dressed white people. That is his area.\\xa0  Mike  : Exactly and so he\\'s weirdly blind to sort of like the realities of policing and the fact that it\\'s not only the personality and the situation that are these sort of two opposing forces that make us behave the way that we do.\\xa0 It\\'s also like, well, what race are the police? And what race are the quote unquote criminals and what messages do the police get about criminals and like could that be affecting their behavior too Phil?\\xa0  Sarah  : And did the police live in the communities that they are working in.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : And what kind of training are they receiving and who\\'s in charge of them?\\xa0  Mike  : So now we know the kind of person that Phil Zimbardo is. We are finally going to talk about the experiment itself.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yay.  Mike  : Yay, so a lot of this comes from a researcher named Tebeau Latitsay.\\xa0  Sarah  : Wow. \\xa0  Mike  : He is the only researcher who has ever gone back and looked at the entire archive of material produced by the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Mike  : And he wrote a book called The History of a Lie.   \\xa0  Sarah  : Mmmm.\\xa0  Mike  : The asterisk behind this book is that the book is in French and it has not been translated into English. So I called him up, talked to him about everything that he found, and I had a bunch of questions and he was nice enough to send me a Google translated version of the book.\\xa0  Sarah  : Was it readable?  \\xa0  Mike  : It was actually pretty good, weirdly.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Wow.\\xa0  Mike  : The only weird thing was that every time it referred to guards, it said goalkeepers because I guess that\\'s the French word.  \\xa0  Sarah  : That’s really great though.  \\xa0  Mike  : So just we\\'re just going to kind of walk through the experiment step-by-step. The first thing that he found that has really never been discussed is that the Stanford Prison Experiment was plagiarized from a previous experiment.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ooooh.\\xa0  Mike  : The Stanford prison study was August 14th to 19th 1971. In May of 1971, one of Phil Zimbardo\\'s students had done a similar thing at his dormitory.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oooh.\\xa0   \\xa0  Mike  : He had gotten a bunch of participants. He had arbitrarily split them up into prisoners and guards and for a weekend he had them sort of play these roles and exactly the same thing happened. Sarah: Huh. \\xa0  Mike  : The researcher who did it was one of some Zimbardo’s students named David Jaffe.\\xa0  Sarah  : Did he do this for like a paper or a project?  \\xa0  Mike:   Yeah he did it for a project in Zimbardo\\'s class.\\xa0  Sarah  : Isn’t he owed like money or something?\\xa0  Mike  : He’s actually an interesting figure because he\\'s one of the central figures in the Stanford Prison Experiment, because he\\'s like one of the main wardens and yet he\\'s never given an interview to the press and to boost that when he called, David Jaffe, he hung up on him.\\xa0  Sarah  : Hmm.\\xa0  Mike:   This is a thing that happens in research all the time that you sort of take somebody else\\'s methodology and you sort of extended or replicated or whatever. But what Tebeau points out is that it\\'s just really weird that Zimbardo has never talked about this.\\xa0  Sarah  : Like, it would make sense to be like my student had a wonderful idea and we collaborated.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah, the other thing that Tebeau finds in the archives is basically that from day one, Zimbardo was thinking of this as an awareness raising exercise for prison reform. As early as the second day of the study, when he sends out this press release in the press release, he says the study should make us aware that prison reform is psychologically necessary so that the men who commit crimes are not transformed into objects dehumanized by their prison experience. And this was day two, this was before anything happened.  \\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, and it\\'s just like, so he\\'s clearly going in assuming what kind of results he\\'s going to get. And that seems to be what he\\'s doing with these other experiments that we\\'ve talked about.  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : Which you can\\'t do.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes. It\\'s bad. Yes. So that\\'s basically the Genesis of the study. So now we\\'re going to get into the actual study itself and I am going to send you a photo.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh yay, okay male students needed to participate in psychological study of prison life. $15 per day for one to two weeks, beginning, August 14 further information and applications may be obtained in room 248 Jordan Hall.\\xa0  Mike  : What do you think this is Sarah? What could it possibly be?\\xa0  Sarah  : I feel like it might be our experiment Mike. \\xa0  Mike  : Ummm hmmm, this is the advertisement asking for participants in the study.\\xa0  Sarah  : Male students.\\xa0  Mike  : Male, I know. \\xa0  Sarah  : Capital male.\\xa0  Mike  :\\xa0 So Zimbardo gets 75 respondents to the ad and an important aspect of this that comes up again and again, and I feel like it is totally downplayed in all of the textbooks about this is that $15 bucks a day is a hundred dollars a day in 2020\\xa0 money. Which is like actually pretty good money. \\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, a hundred bucks a day for a student or a grad student seems very enticing.  Mike  : Yes and a lot of them appear to have read the thing about prison life to assume that they would be sort of like in prison cells, but like with nothing to do. So a lot of them brought like stacks of books. One guy wanted to study for the GRE.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ohhh. \\xa0  Mike  : He was like, well, I can make money and I can just like, whatever, be in a prison cell with my book studying, and it\\'ll be some dumb prison thing, but I can make money and study for the GRE.\\xa0  Sarah  : It is interesting that they assumed that prison life is like, you know, you sit there quietly reading all day and it\\'s like, oh, okay that\\'s your first problem.  \\xa0  Mike  : So on Sunday, August 14th, they arrest all of the guys.\\xa0  Sarah  : Do they like to break things in their houses and shoot their girlfriends and stuff too?\\xa0  Mike  :\\xa0 No, but he does get real cops. I mean, he asked the police department of Palo Alto to go and arrest them and he drives to San Francisco to pick up a local reporter who has a camera, and then drives him to the arrests.  Sarah:   Ok I really appreciate this level of commitment. I think Zimbardo was maybe more of a showman than an academic, but like he\\'s really shining in these details.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes so he basically picks up all of the prisoners and gets them into this like weird little basement corridor in Jordan Hall of Stanford. Zimbardo has always defended the study and called it scientific because of the random coin flip to assign people to either prisoner or guard.\\xa0  Sarah:   That coin is like the nevertheless it\\'s like, if it\\'s all hanging on something so little, I don\\'t know.  Mike  : Well, also this is not even a remotely random sample of the population. \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah.\\xa0  Mike  : Even if you randomize later you\\'re getting A, all dudes, B all people who have like nothing else to do during the summer and C all people who are enticed by a hundred dollars a day.\\xa0  Sarah:   And are they Stanford students, are they all Stanford students?  Mike  : It’s not clear how many, any of them are. A lot of them are just sort of like bumming around Palo Alto or they\\'re from there, or, you know, or some of them are like matriculating in the fall, but they haven\\'t started yet. It\\'s actually quite a mix.  \\xa0  Sarah:   Ok. Mike: There’s actually a thing in 2007, this is like, so fucking salty. There\\'s these researchers who place an almost word for word recapitulation of this ad in the newspaper. And they get all these respondents and then they just give them personality tests, and then they send them home. And what they find is that the kind of person who responds to an ad like this is way higher like aggressiveness and all of these other personality traits, then the population as a whole.\\xa0  Sarah  : Right.\\xa0  Mike  : It comes back to something that Tebeau found when he went into the archives. So one of the things Zimbardo has always said to defend the study is that, you know, there\\'s recordings of the study. And, you know, if you go on YouTube, you can find all of the clips that they have and, you know, they kept all this data and they did personality tests on the subjects. But of the 150 hours that the study took, only six hours were recorded on video. And there\\'s another sort of 10-12 hours that are audio recordings but a lot of that is just like the day long orientation that they gave the guards on the first day. And he admits because filming was expensive - he admits that they only turned on the camera when like something super fucked up was going on. They\\'re like, ooh we better film this.\\xa0  Sarah:   So yeah and then it becomes, it\\'s like, okay, so are you saying that like the system disintegrated in a consistent way or that like the disturbing things happened at various points? Causes like these are different things.  \\xa0  Mike  : Exactly again, we see just like we saw with the Tuskegee study that there\\'s all this talk of like, you know, the scientific validity and how it\\'s so important for science. And then you look into it and the actual science is extremely bad.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Ahhhh. \\xa0  Mike  : So the first day of the study was an orientation for the guards and this becomes a really important component of the debate over the study that has been going on for decades now. So we are going to do a little table read.\\xa0  Sarah:   Okay.\\xa0  Mike  : I’m going to give you the meaty roll.\\xa0  Sarah:   Oh, thank you,so generous. Mike: As an intro to this, this is what Philip Zimbardo says in his defense has 7,000 word defense of the Stanford Prison Experiment. This is from the first day of the study, like the first day that they\\'re actually in the prison, he says one of the three guards on a shift that day left the area during a prisoner count and wasn\\'t even requiring prisoners to follow orders issued by the other guards. So David Jaffe acting as the warden, took this guard aside and asked him to become more active, involved and tough in order to make the experimental setting seem more like a prison. So this is the conversation between David Jaffe, the warden and this guard that is kind of like not really taking it seriously on the first day. So you can go ahead and be Jaffe and I\\'ll be the guard.\\xa0  Sarah:   Okay, I\\'m Jaffe. Generally, you\\'ve been kind of in the background. Part of that is my fault because I\\'ve got aligned with you when you wanted to sit outside while they were doing the count or that sort of thing, but we really want to get you active and involved because the guards have to know that every guard is going to be what we call a tough guard.  Mike  : I’m not too tough.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, well you have to try and get it in you.  \\xa0  Mike  : Well, I don\\'t know about that.\\xa0  Sarah  : See, the thing is what I mean by tough is you have to be firm and you have to be in the action and that sort of thing. It\\'s really important for the workings of the experiment, because whether or not we can make this thing seem like a prison, because the aim of the thing largely depends on the guard\\'s behavior.  Mike:   Nope, end of transcript. What do you think?\\xa0  Sarah  : So, okay. You can\\'t say that you bring in people and say, you\\'re the prisoners and you\\'re the guards and they start spontaneously doing prisoner guard stuff when really you\\'re like, hey buddy. We got to ask you to be more of a guard. You\\'re not really giving it a hundred percent.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes, yes.  Sarah  : It’s like the whole premise of the experiment and the point of why it\\'s supposed to be interesting is, is we\\'d be like, oh my gosh, these guys started giving a hundred percent and we never asked for it.  \\xa0  Mike:   Exactly, this drives me nuts.\\xa0  Sarah  : Nevertheless.  \\xa0  Mike  : The thing I kept thinking this whole week, when I was reading about it was like, you know, we\\'re going to do a study on how many slices of pizza college students will eat if we give it to them for free. Right and if you pull one college student aside and you\\'re like, you\\'re not eating enough pizza.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yes.\\xa0  Mike:   It’s like, this is the fucking thing you\\'re supposed to be measuring.\\xa0  Sarah  : That’s exactly what it is. It\\'s like, Jamie, you really need to be bulking up, okay, like doesn’t that Hawaiian like pretty good too ya? \\xa0  Mike:  \\xa0 So one of the things that Tebeau finds when he goes back into the archives and listens to all the recordings and looks at all the documents, is it like they had a training day for the guards where they specifically told them basically to be abusive. It was not a mystery that the researchers wanted the guards to act super-duper goalkeeper ish.  \\xa0Sarah  : It\\'s just so weird because these experiments are like, he\\'s like hit the car, abuse the prisoner. And it\\'s like why are you encouraging this outcome? And then running to the media and being like, “Oh my God, you guy.” \\xa0  Mike:   I know.   \\xa0  Sarah  : People and antisocial behaviors and\\xa0 it\\'s like because you enticed them to do so. What is the purpose of this?\\xa0  Mike:   Yes, one of my favorite things because Zimbardo famously testifies at the trial against one of the Abu Ghraib torturers and I have not found him admitting this anywhere else but on cross examination in that trial.\\xa0 They\\'re basically like pushing him on this idea that the guards did this all spontaneously like without orders. And they ask him about the fact that the prisoners in the Stanford Prison Experiment that the guards would often put a bag on their head and Zimbardo says, you know, they did this spontaneously. And then the prosecutor\\'s like, well, didn\\'t you tell them to do this? And Zimbardo was like, oh yeah, we told them to put a bag on the prisoner\\'s head when they walked them to the bathroom, because the bathroom is in a different building, but soon they started doing it themselves.\\xa0 Well, you still told them to do it and just because they did it more doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re getting into their role as guards. It\\'s like, they\\'re just following orders.\\xa0  Sarah:   They started doing it spontaneously after I told them too.  Mike  : Exactly.\\xa0  Sarah  :It\\'s also, this is like a great testament to how low the bar for relevance or expertise is for an expert witness.\\xa0 And this is not even that bad.\\xa0  Mike  : I know there\\'s actually a great book one of the prosecutors at the Abu Ghraib trial wrote a book. It was called   The Secrets of Abu Ghraib  , which is actually really interesting. And he has a whole chapter dedicated to how Zimbardo’s full of shit. It\\'s such a detour.\\xa0  Sarah:   This is like, yeah, like Nancy Grace wishes she had a real nemesis like this.\\xa0  Mike:   This is also the last thing I want to say about this. This is completely absurd. So two guards quit the study. One of them quit because he didn\\'t like how harsh the training was.\\xa0  Sarah:   I wanted to study for the LSATs in there, honestly.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. So this is from Tebeau\\'s book. One of his Zimbardo’s guards resigned an interesting fact that I have only found a mention of once in 47 years. In the press release on the second day of the experiment, one of the guards refused to continue because he found that it was too heavy.  Sarah: This is just like Kitty Genovese, because it\\'s like, wow, people are truly awful unless you ignore these like 17 other contrasting pieces of evidence, but forget about it. Nevertheless, I mean, it\\'s just weird because it\\'s like, okay, sorry to get all the awfully cold in here, Mike.\\xa0  Mike  : I knew he was going to come up.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Sorry to take us through the cul\\xa0 de sac.  Sarah:   Aren’t we actually getting into an interesting concept of how, like the act of being assigned as a guard for another human being is intrinsically sadistic and trying to replicate even your vegas understanding of what prison guardship is like means? Encouraging the roots of sadism cause it\\'s like prisons are sadistic institutions. So like it\\'s because whatever you tell them to do, there will be sadism involved, I think. \\xa0  Mike:  \\xa0 This is actually what, one of the very interesting epilogues of the Stanford Prison Experiment, because there\\'s an Australian team of researchers that attempts to replicate it in 1979. This is the thing that never shows up in the textbooks.\\xa0 And instead of running it, once they run it three times. And in one condition, it\\'s like a super duper harsh prison, harsh guards and like basically the same thing that happened in Zimbardo\\'s experiment happens in theirs, although it\\'s like slightly less rough. But then in these other two conditions, they run it with more sort of participatory structures and more dialogue between prisoners and guards.\\xa0 And it basically ends up being like summer camp, when there\\'s more ways for prisoners to participate in the conditions of their imprisonment. They\\'re like, look, we get it. We can\\'t leave. There\\'s going to be curfews. There\\'s going to be counts, et cetera. But let\\'s talk about how to structure these in like the least dehumanizing way possible.  Mike:   It actually ends up much less dehumanizing. So one of the things that ends up traveling from this study is this idea that like prisons are inherently abusive -guard, prisoner relationships are inherently sadistic, but the specifics actually really matter. \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, see this is me being ruined by being an American, like a society does need situations where like people are capable of supervising other people without abusing them, which I think is something that we can\\'t really do in any way in America on a large scale.  Mike  : I mean, I always think there\\'s, there\\'s been a lot of really interesting articles in New York review of books about prison rape. It\\'s a fucking joke in our society, but it\\'s extremely not funny. And it happens pervasively, but it happens much more in some prisons than in others. There are things you can do structurally to prevent prison rape and we don\\'t do those things in some prisons. So all of this sadistic quote, unquote psychopathic behavior of guards, it\\'s like, it actually matters the way that you set up these institutions.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. So what are like, what are the basic guard rules? What are the other things that they\\'re told to do? \\xa0  Mike:   Well? Zimbardo is big on sort of the trappings of authority. So he makes sure that the guards have uniforms. He makes sure that the prisoners have uniforms that are deliberately designed to be emasculating. So he makes them put on these sort of like hospital gown-ish uniforms with no underwear. So they\\'re just sort of like in physical discomfort.\\xa0  Sarah  : People in prison have underwear.  Mike  : I mean, this is, this is another thing it\\'s like in some ways, the study is like less hardcore than a real prison. And in some ways it\\'s more hardcore than a real prison. A big thing is he asks the guards to call the prisoners by their numbers, never their names. He makes them put a lock, like a big, heavy padlock around one of their feet.\\xa0 So they basically don\\'t get any sleep every night because it\\'s just really uncomfortable this thing.\\xa0  Sarah  : We’re like, we can\\'t replicate prison, but we can do something else. That\\'s really weird.\\xa0  Mike  : Exactly, I mean, over the next couple of days, The guards really do get pretty creative and pretty sadistic. I mean, we\\'re going to go now into sort of what actually happens once the study starts.\\xa0 So I think it\\'s important to watch clips of this just so you can see how cloistered and weird the environment is but also like a lot of the footage is pretty disturbing because bad stuff really did happen. So we\\'re going to watch a clip from   Quiet Rage  , which is the documentary that Zimbardo produced about the study.  Sarah:   All right.\\xa0  Mike:   All right.\\xa0  Sarah:   Three, two, one go!\\xa0  *video clip plays*  \\xa0 Because the first day passed without incident, we were surprised and totally unprepared for the rebellion, which broke out on the morning of the second day. When waking the prisons for the 10 o\\'clock count, the morning guard shift found that the prisoners in cell number one had removed their stocking calves, ripped off their numbers and barricaded themselves inside the cells.\\xa0 By putting their beds against the door. Prisons began to taunt and curse the guards to their face. This, of course, embarrassed and upset the guards. The morning shift immediately called in reinforcements. They asked the night shift to stay on and they called up three other standby guards to help put down the rebellion.  Sarah  : Well this kind of makes it all make sense to me actually.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : It’s like, you got a bunch of young guys, you divided them into two groups, they developed a rivalry and then it\\'s like, they\\'re just going to escalate that over time it seems like  .\\xa0  Mik  e: Yes. \\xa0  Sarah  : And that\\'s the dynamic between two groups of guys is happens on the bachelorette. This happens in fraternities.\\xa0  Mike  : One of the very smart things that the guards do after this rebellion is they start a divide and conquer strategy. So they convert one of the cells into like the privilege cell where you get like nice blankets, a nice bed, I think you get better food. And then they\\'re totally arbitrary with who gets into the privilege cell and who isn\\'t.\\xa0 So the prisoners turn on each other, like, are you ratting us out? At one point, they make them clean the toilets with their hands.\\xa0  Sarah:   That’s dangerous. You get sepsis from that.\\xa0  Mike:   It’s not good. They also, they won\\'t let them go to the bathroom at night. So they put buckets in their cells and then they won\\'t let them empty the buckets, which is like really fucking gross.\\xa0 So it just like smells awful.\\xa0  Sarah:   Ya.\\xa0  Mike  : So on day three is the first prisoner gets released. One of the prisoners basically starts breaking down, crying. So we go from nine prisoners down to eight prisoners.\\xa0  Sarah:   How many guards?\\xa0  Mike  : Also nine.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ok.  \\xa0  Mike  : Another extremely weird thing on day four, they bring in visitors. It just seems like it would encourage the prisoners to break character rather than to maintain character.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, exactly. They haven\\'t been immersed for very long .\\xa0  Mike  : In the   New York     Times   magazine article that Zimbardo published in 1973, he does this extremely unconvincing thing where he talks about how, like even the visitors adopted their role as prison visitors cause like we chopped down the visitor time from an hour to only 10 minutes and they were upset about it, but they only complained to the warden and it\\'s like, I dunno man like they probably just didn\\'t know who else to complain to, I don\\'t know.  \\xa0  Sarah  : It’s a little thin.\\xa0  Mike  : He also on day five they bring in a priest. I don\\'t know why Zimbardo did all these weird theatrics. He brings in a priest to like, sort of pretend to be a prison chaplain. And then in his article he talks about how like, even the priest adopted his role and was acting like a prison chaplain.  Sarah  : Well, can you really tell the difference on site between a prison chaplain and a regular Priest though?\\xa0  Mike  : Exactly.\\xa0  Sarah:   This orthodontist took on the role of a dentist.\\xa0  Mike  : But this is, this is just another, like put down the vape fill moment. You\\'re like, I guess he took on his role, but like, why bother? Just talk about the prisoners and the guardsman. Sarah: Ya.\\xa0  Mike:   On day five, there\\'s also a prisoner goes on hunger strike.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, wow. That did escalate quickly but also, do you remember like day three of quarantine and in like March where people were like, I\\'m planning my garden and then you look back and you\\'re like, oh yeah, look at that.  Mike:   There’s also another one of the people who left the study is you see this in all of the descriptions of the Stanford Prison Experiment, there\\'s Zimbardo and other people will say, you know, the conditions got so bad. One guy got a rash all over his body and he had to leave the study and this is always seen as sort of this like psychosomatic illness of the conditions are so bad and he\\'s such a prisoner that he gets this rash and Zimbardo talks about it as like him internalizing the conditions in the prison. It turns out one of the prisoners had eczema and they took away his medication. So the only reason that he got this rash all over his body was because he didn\\'t have his eczema medication with him for a week.\\xa0 Like it\\'s not that mysterious.\\xa0  But one of the things Zimbardo always talks about how, you know, people really got into the role as prisoner and they really sort of adopted the self identity as a prisoner and a lot of them were having these like sort of breakdowns and like trying to get out of there.\\xa0 But what\\'s weird and what he doesn\\'t see the significance of is that all of them thought that they couldn\\'t leave the experiment.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, see, this is the bit to me. This is supposed to be the biggest, like twist reveal of it all. It\\'s like they could have left at any time.\\xa0  Mike  : Zimbardo says they could have left at any time, but like, oh, they were so into the roles. \\xa0  Sarah  : Also, what if they really need the like 300 bucks or whatever they\\'re hoping it works out to.  Mike  : Exactly and another very important thing about the payment is that you don\\'t get paid until the end. \\xa0  Sarah  : Ya.\\xa0  Mike  : So they had an incentive to stay on as long as possible.\\xa0  Sarah:   Come on, Phil, if it\\'s such a good study, why do you have to hide stuff?  Mike  : Exactly. So Zimbardo now says, he\\'s like, if they said I quit the experiment here by, then I would\\'ve let them leave, but there\\'s no evidence that he ever communicated that to any of them.\\xa0  Sarah:   Ya.\\xa0  Mike:   This is weird to me. This is, uh, from Tebeau\\'s book. He points out that in the sort of application to the Stanford ethics committee, there\\'s a sentence in there that it says that they would be led to believe that they couldn\\'t leave except for emergency reasons. So first of all, it is fucking nuts that an ethics committee looked at this and was like, have a good one Phil sounds good. Secondly, I don\\'t know what the difference is between prisoners in a prison and research subjects that cannot leave an experiment.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah, I think he gets to accidentally started a prison honey.\\xa0  Mike  : Zimbardo keeps talking about like, oh, like they took on the identity of prisoners but they were prisoners.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, you just rounded up a bunch of people who didn\\'t need to be there and then systematically mistreated them.\\xa0  Mike  : And one guy, I mean, some of the guys that had these sort of breakdowns, that was the only way to get out of the study.\\xa0  Sarah  : So he\\'s like, I started a little prison and everyone acted like they were in prison. Mike: Well they were in prison.\\xa0  Sarah  : Science.\\xa0  Mike  : There’s also the accusation that some of the participants were faking.\\xa0  Sarah  : Hmmm.  Mike  : So we\\'re going to listen to a clip. This is one of the prisoners named Doug Korpi, who has a breakdown and later says that he faked the breakdown.\\xa0  Sarah:   Interesting.\\xa0  Mike:   So he says that you can tell from this clip that he\\'s faking.\\xa0  Sarah  : Ok.\\xa0  *video clip plays  * ”I feel really fucked up inside, I really feel fucked up inside. You don\\'t know. I got to go to a doctor, anything. I can\\'t see them. I’m fucked up, I don\\'t know how to explain, I’m fucked up inside.\\xa0 I want out, I want out now. God dammit, I’m fucked up. You don\\'t know, you don\\'t know, I mean God.\\xa0 I mean, Jesus Christ, I’m burning up inside don’t you know.\\xa0 I just can’t fucking take it.”\\xa0  Sarah:   Sorry, I felt that the don’t ya know.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   It’s funny. I wouldn\\'t say that I can tell that\\'s fake because I think that people who are being very sincere can sound sincere and vice versa all the time.  \\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : But yeah he, I mean, he certainly, I\\'ve heard people whose, whose hearts are, are more in it.  \\xa0  Mike:   Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : He sounds tired. He sounds too tired to be having a full breakdown. He doesn\\'t have that like crazy breakdown strength that circumvents fatigue, if you\\'re like really beside yourself, he\\'s he\\'s like, I\\'m making a scene.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   Please, ahhh, I appreciate the effort.\\xa0  Mike:   He now says that he was faking it but Zimbardo points out correctly that he\\'s changed his story a bunch of times over the years.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh ok.\\xa0  Mike  : He participates in a documentary where he says I had a breakdown, I totally believed it. He shows up on Dr. Phil with Zimbardo at one point and tells the story as if it was totally true. There\\'s also one of the guards now says that he was making it up, that he was playing a character from Cool Hand Luke. The footage is really funny cause he likes it, he he\\'s from, I think the Pacific Northwest he\\'s never been to Texas, but he adopts this like extremely fake Texas accent. It\\'s like, now I\\'m going to give you a choice.\\xa0  Sarah  : East Texas, I guess.\\xa0  Mike  : I mean, his is worse than mine and mine is quite bad. Another thing Tebeau of course interviewed him and said, He was a theater major and was like doing a lot of improv at the time. \\xa0  Sarah:   Theatre.\\xa0  Mike:   Zimbardo says that he also has a reason to lie and say that he was faking it which I actually agree with. Like, if I was acting like a complete prick in one of the world\\'s most famous psychological studies, I would probably say like, oh, I was just pretending to be a prick. \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, I mean, there\\'s like there\\'s degrees in all of these situations.  Mike:   I mean, I actually don\\'t find the idea that some of the participants were faking it all that compelling because I think there\\'s such better evidence that this entire study was bullshit. The central fact that has never been a secret; you don\\'t need to go to any archives to find it, is that not all of the guards were sadistic.\\xa0 It\\'s only about three of the guards that ever acted shitty.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, that\\'s quite low, that’s a third.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah:   It’s probably a third of a random, you know guys are shitty in Palo Alto.\\xa0  Mike  : So there’s a   New York Times   article written about Zimbardo in the study in 1971 after he testifies before Congress. And he says, it\\'s clear that almost anyone put in a certain kind of situation can be made to behave toward other beings in a demeaning and brutal fashion.\\xa0 No, because it\\'s not almost anyone, it\\'s one third, in your own study.\\xa0  \\xa0  Sarah:   Right, like I get what he\\'s trying to say and it and it connects with something that I really try to say, which is like, we\\'re all capable of like much worse behavior, then it\\'s comfortable to believe like people who\\'ve done horrible things probably were not born destined to do horrible things. \\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : And you can also do something scary at one time in your life and then be safe for people to be around at other times. And I feel like what he\\'s trying to say is in line with that, but I feel like he\\'s also trying to say human beings are capable of any kind of behavior and I can induce it in them in 48 hours.  Mike  : Exactly. And you really can’t.  \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah.\\xa0  Mike:   One of the best articles talking shit on the Stanford Prison Experiment is by Eric Fromm and it\\'s from 1973, the same year that the study itself comes out. This is what he says. \"The authors believe it proves that the situation alone can within a few days transform normal people into abject submissive individuals or into ruthless sadists.\\xa0 It seems to me that the experiment proves if anything, rather the contrary. In spite of the whole spirit of this mock prison, which was meant to be degrading and humiliating, two thirds of the guards did not commit sadistic acts for personal kicks.\\xa0 The experiment seems rather to prove that one can not transform people so easily into sadists by providing them with the proper situation.”  Sarah:   Yeah.  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah and I feel like this connects to like the false binary that actually leads people to feel such resistance to the ideas that I\\'m, I\\'m talking about, where, you know, people like so you\\'re telling me that I\\'m not in control of my actions at all. And if some professor puts me in a basement I’ll become abusive in two days.\\xa0 And it\\'s like, no, I\\'m just saying that like human beings are complex. And we do things for a lot of reasons all at once, all the time, you know, because this idea that like, not just that human beings are complicated and malleable, but that they\\'re so malleable and like an individual person can so easily predict and bend around their natures.\\xa0 It\\'s like, that\\'s the kind of hubris that keeps actual prisons around.\\xa0  Mike:   Right. So we\\'re going to do a sort of mega debunking, but I just want to talk very quickly about how they stopped the study.  \\xa0  Sarah  : The Meg.\\xa0  Mike:   So he\\'s told various different stories over the years, the sort of the story that he has alighted on is that his girlfriend at the time who\\'s named Christina Mazlock. The story, the sort of official story is that he brought her to the prison.\\xa0 And she saw all the dudes like shackled with paper bags on their heads. This was day five of the study and then that night they got in some huge fight where she\\'s like, you\\'re dehumanizing these people, this is awful. You need to stop this experiment and Zimbardo eventually agreed and the next day he came in and stopped the experiment to Bose theory.\\xa0 Zimbardo stopped the study because he hadn\\'t slept in two days. And he basically had already gotten what he needed to get and he was exhausted.\\xa0  Sarah:   And he was like tired of supervising it because once he was just there the whole time, like, it seems like this was a tiny team.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah. It was like three of his researchers and\\xa0 then Zimbardo. \\xa0  Sarah  : It’s weird because they\\'re the guards in the situation, like they\\'re the ones that are supervising these kids. \\xa0  Mike  : And also a very well known technique in persuasion is to admit the weaknesses in your own argument because it builds trust and it makes people see you as a reliable interlocutor more. What\\'s interesting about the way that Zimbardo talks about this and the way that Zimbardo writes this up is he always says like, I too was getting too into my role as the warden. Like he talks about the weaknesses.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, well, yeah. It\\'s like the experiment was too powerful.\\xa0  Mike  : Exactly, but what we know is that on day six, he ends the experiment.  Sarah  : I hope he gave them a car to beat up later as a thank you gift.\\xa0  Mike  : I know. So basically the study ends and then it becomes the stuff of legend. But I want to spend the rest of the show doing a sort of like all hands on deck debunking because I think the, sort of the central you\\'re wrong about, of this episode, isn\\'t really sort of the new information that\\'s come out or the secret documents or behind the scenes stuff.\\xa0 It\\'s really that this never should have been in the textbooks in the first place. Some of the best writing about the Stanford Prison Experiment is done by Holocaust scholars who were basically saying, “why the fuck study a bunch of people in a different country, in a different language.\\xa0 If you wanted to understand the Holocaust, just study the Holocaust to understand the Holocaust.”  Sarah:   Listen, if they think the Holocaust is close, they should see how close prisons are.\\xa0  Mike  : Again, there\\'s a lot of debate over what Hannah Arendt said and thought, et cetera, but the sort of the message from Eichmann in Jerusalem that traveled is not true. Adolf Eichmann was not a middle manager who was just following orders.\\xa0 He was a rabid anti-Semite. \\xa0  Sarah:   Right, he was painting himself as that in testimony.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes, exactly. That was a legal defense. The whole thing of, I was just following orders is a fucking excuse for that behavior. It\\'s a way to avoid culpability. It\\'s not an actual explanation. This is from, this is an excerpt from a Holocaust researcher who is talking about Zimbardo.\\xa0 “What was truly frightening about Eichmann was not that he was unaware of what he was doing, but rather that he knew what he was doing and believed it to be right. \\xa0 Equally, what is shocking about Milgram\\'s experiments is it rather than being distressed by their actions, participants could be led to construe them as service in the cause of goodness.”\\xa0 So this is a big lesson from the Holocaust that if you convince somebody that something horrific is like for the greater good. You can convince people to do incredibly shitty things.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yes.\\xa0  Mike:   This is something that Zimbardo was blind to that a lot of his participants thought that they were part of a study that was going to contribute to prison reform. \\xa0  Sarah  : And maybe they wanted to try out an accent. And also like he himself is doing this shitty thing and telling himself it\\'s part of the greater good, like, regardless of whatever was going on in their minds, like we know that was happening.\\xa0  Mike  : Oh, absolutely. There’s also some very interesting research from actual prisons.\\xa0 Zimbardo didn\\'t give a shit about prisons. He didn\\'t know anything about prisons. He had never been to a prison. One thing that\\'s very important, they actually say structurally, the Stanford Prison Experiment is much closer to a POW camp or a concentration camp then a prison because in prisons, first of all, there\\'s an existing hierarchy.\\xa0 You don\\'t have prisons that are being made spontaneously with a bunch of prisoners all arriving there and guards at the exact same time.\\xa0  What happens is when you go into prison, you are one person and there are decades long social systems in place. There are people who are older there, the guards have all kinds of standards of behavior that have been built up over years.\\xa0 It’s not really teaching us anything about prisons to have this pop-up prison, like a fucking street food restaurant in soho. \\xa0  Sarah  : It’s underestimating the complexity of prisons.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes. This is an excerpt from a 1958 study on prisons about the ways that guards and wardens behave;  “  The warden frequently fails to report rule violations that have taken place in front of him.\\xa0 The guard often transmits prohibited information to the detainees, such as plans to surprise certain cells to search for contraband. The warden has a habit of buying obedience in some cases while tolerating disobedience elsewhere. And who knows if he will not one day be held hostage by the prisoners.\\xa0 Prison therefore does not necessarily lead to the strictest authoritarianism as Zimbardo believes.\\xa0 It can just as much lead to collusion, compromise and appeasement.\\xa0 The person versus situation and the relationship between a human being and the structures of power around them is really complex.”   \\xa0  Sarah  : Well, can we also talk about how, if you create a study and know what kind of result you want to get out of it, then it\\'s going to be very difficult for you to not reverse engineer it to confirm your bias because it seems like no one was really taking pains to try and avoid that  .\\xa0  Mike  : Totally. \\xa0  Sarah:   And then I think whatever you got from that is really fruit of the poison tree, because the study didn\\'t do anything for an knowledge about prisons didn\\'t do anything for a knowledge about the Holocaust, but it did teach us a lot about what we as Americans wanted to hear and wanted to believe about what human beings were like in 1971.  \\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : I feel as if using this as a way of saying like, well prisons just naturally degrade into abusive situations, nothing to be done. That interpretation of this data so to speak also ignores the possibility of a world where there is such a thing as a prison that actively tries to uphold the rights of its inmates. \\xa0  Mike:   Umm Hmm. \\xa0  Sarah:   \\xa0The idea that it\\'s possible to have a prison whose guards aren’t engaging in sadism, I think actually appears to be pretty absent from the American mind based on this study and my response to it.\\xa0 Me and Zimbardo were the same.   \\xa0  Mike:   Yes. \\xa0  Sarah  : And I think this also explains part of our attachment, like our social need for the prisoner.\\xa0 Not even the prison or the criminal as a figure is the idea that like, once someone can be branded a criminal, you can do anything to them. You can kill them in the street, you can steal their kids, whatever you can do whatever. And I feel like we might just be reliant on the concept of like needing to have certain kinds of people who like cops and white people can murder whatever they want.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah, yeah. \\xa0  Sarah:   I don\\'t love it.\\xa0  Mike  : This to me gets at, I think, the underrated reason why this study isn\\'t applicable to real-world prisons or genocides or totalitarian regimes, whatever is all but one of the participants were white.\\xa0 One of the participants was Asian-American and this is somehow seen as making it more scientifically valid. Like we\\'re taking away, you know, gender differences, we\\'re taking away racial differences and we can focus only on the human traits that make us more or less susceptible to sadism. But the fact is most prisons have a racial component to them.\\xa0 Most totalitarian regimes have a racial component to them.\\xa0 Trying to hold all of these other factors constant, it doesn\\'t actually tell you anything because the real world does not hold those factors constant. And in fact, racial dehumanization and gender bias and all of the implicit fucking garbage that we go into situations with actually explains totalitarian regimes a lot.  Mike  : So to take all of that away and be like, oh, well now we have a pure explanation. No, it\\'s a less convincing explanation. If you don\\'t have any of those aspects at play.\\xa0  Sarah  : It’s like alpha males. It\\'s like, why are these people behaving this way? It\\'s like, well, because the situation is weird.\\xa0  Mike  : I mean, so much of the story is really about the sort of ted talk ification of social science.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah.\\xa0  Mike  : One of the things that gives the Stanford Prison Experiment credibility is this idea that it\\'s scientific.\\xa0 That we can take universal lessons from it in a way that we can\\'t from actual history. So it\\'s always interesting to me in a country where like, we don\\'t have great historical teaching.\\xa0 We don\\'t have a great sense of like what\\'s going on in other countries and yet, we sort of fall over and over again for these like, to pat, ted talky, little descriptions of things that come from very isolated studies when, like the reasons why people collaborate with totalitarian regimes, like, are we short on totalitarian regimes?\\xa0 The majority of the world population lived under dictatorial regimes at that time.\\xa0  Sarah  : I think Phil Zimbardo’s suspiciousness of well-dressed whites is entirely founded and I think that\\'s like the secret hypothesis that his work is confirming the whole time. And he did great with that.\\xa0  Mike:   One of the best quotes on this is from Eric Fromm’s 1973 article, where he says “One cannot help raising the question about the value of such artificial experiments when there is so much material available for natural experiments.\\xa0 The question suggests itself all the more, because experiments of this type, not only lack the alleged accuracy, which is supposed to make them preferable to natural experiments, but also because the artificial setup tends to distort the whole experiment situation as compared to one in real life.\\xa0 What is meant here by real life?” I guess we\\'re not supposed to take lessons from the Holocaust because like it\\'s Germany, it\\'s a specific cultural and political situation, I guess, but then isn\\'t a bunch of fucking Stanford undergrads too.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, it’s certainly, I mean, the Holocaust is certainly less specific than like some students getting paid $15 a day to act weird in a basement.\\xa0  Mike  : Exactly. \\xa0  Sarah  : Like this is a historical saga really that involved the lives of tens of millions of people. You know, this, this feels like American provincialism. \\xa0  Mike:   And this, this thing that once you slap the label of science on something, it becomes somehow more credible than history, which I just think is very, very strange.  Sarah  : Yeah, that’s super weird.\\xa0  Mike  : One of the depressing things about this is that Ben Bloom, who\\'s this freelance journalist who wrote a very good debunker of the study last year.\\xa0 He interviewed a bunch of psychology professors who write textbooks and a huge number of them just told him like, well, it\\'s a really good story so I\\'m going to include it.\\xa0  Sarah  : Gotta keep the kids paying attention. \\xa0  Mike  : Yeah, also, I mean, like I said, I have a degree in psychology when we learned Freud, we didn\\'t learn that like Freud was right.\\xa0  Sarah  : Well, I feel like a parade in Socrates or maybe comparable figures. It\\'s like, did they invent the world in which we live?\\xa0 Yes, where they write about everything? God no.   \\xa0  Mike:   God, no, exactly. So I want to end with a quote from Zimbardo himself. Because he gets a million requests for interviews now, and there\\'s more pressure on him and the field to sort of drop this study finally. And he\\'s now describing the study, like when people say it\\'s like a bullshit experiment and there\\'s methodological problems and ethical problems, he\\'ll say like, ah, it wasn\\'t actually an experiment. It was just a demonstration.  Sarah:   Okay, shouldn’t be in textbooks then though.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah then take it out of the fucking textbook Phil.\\xa0  Sarah:   This is like   Michelle Remembers  . This is like how in the introduction to   Michelle Remembers  , the publisher is like, Michelle thinks it\\'s real. And it\\'s like, okay, that answers one of my questions.\\xa0  Mike:   This is what he tells Ben Bluhm in 2019, he says “At this point, the big problem is I don\\'t want to waste any more of my time. After my talk with you I\\'m not going to do any more interviews about it. People can say whatever they want. It\\'s the most famous study in the history of psychology at this point, there\\'s no study that people talk about 50 years later, ordinary people know about it. It\\'s got a life of its own now. I\\'m not going to defend it anymore. The defense is its longevity.”\\xa0  Sarah:   No.  \\xa0  Mike  : I know. It\\'s been wrong for 50 years, so that’s cool.\\xa0  Sarah:   Right. He\\'s rejecting the core values of the field in which he claims to work.\\xa0  Mike:   Science.\\xa0  Sarah  : This seems like a weird anecdotal experiment that just got picked up by the media through combination of self promotion and confirming ideas about humanity that Americans wanted to have in 1971.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : And the fact that the American media system rewards exciting sounding academic headlines with potentially no meat on them.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : At all, which I realize headlines don\\'t have meat in any case but I\\'m sorry.\\xa0  Mike  : So in closing, don\\'t include the Stanford Prison Experiment in your textbook. \\xa0  Sarah:  \\xa0 And if you want to talk about Kitty Genovese, talk about how her death was misrepresented to sell a social agenda that would probably have only made her life worse had she lived.  \\xa0  Mike  : Yes. Sarah: And share a cute picture of her in a bar or perhaps sitting on a car. \\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   They\\'re both widely available and they show a beautiful living person.\\xa0  Mike  : Yes and if you need to use the word, nevertheless, bump up the fonts. We can all see what you\\'re doing.\\xa0'"

       "\"Sarah:   You're giving me a Princess Diana; I gave you the kid from one of the Robocop movies.  Mike:   Welcome to   You’re Wrong About  , the podcast that tips over the delivery truck of history and sees what comes out the back.  Sarah:   Oh, I love that. I'm Sarah Marshall, I'm working on a book about the Satanic Panic.  Mike:   I’m Michael Hobbes, I'm a reporter for the   Huffington Post  . And if you want to support the show, we are on Patreon at   patreon.com/yourewrongabout  . And you can also find cute t-shirts and other ways to support us, or you can just keep tuning in for our thrilling conclusion.  Sarah:   We are talking about Disney today.  Mike:   So, where are we?  Sarah:   I'm going to ask you that question because it is your job to learn about   The Newsies.   And I'm curious about what you find to be salient about what we talked about last time?  Mike:   I think the Newsies pronounce it, “What did I loin?” Last week we met the newsboys who stand on street corners selling the newspapers. This is how the newspapers reach the mass public. And just after we met our newsboys, we learned that Pulitzer and Hearst increased the price of the papes for them to sell. And all of a sudden, they sort of came out of the Spanish American war and were like, wait a minute. Nobody's buying the papers as much because the war is over, and we just gave up 10% of our profits. And this sucks. So let's go on strike.  Sarah:   Yeah. And we are talking about a real-life strike and we were also talking about a Disney film, that is very important to me and many other people, but is not apparently to the Disney Company.  One of the images that came into my head as I was researching this, because one of the words that comes up a lot in the story is ‘circulation’. Just imagine, think of New York City and the information flowing around New York City in 1899. And then think of the newsboys striking, and it's like the flow of blood around this body has been disrupted. I imagine it's like putting a tourniquet on like all four limbs.  Mike:   And instead of numbness, you have ignorance of world events.  Sarah:   Now, even though there's like more blood in this body than ever before, but I didn't know that image came into my head and it means a lot to me and trying to understand what the strike was and why it was so effective, that like these child workers accurately recognize themselves as like absolutely essential to the welfare of society.  Mike:   Right. It's not like they were selling donuts on the street and everyone just had to switch to cupcakes for a week. Like this was really the lifeblood of a democracy.  Sarah:   Yeah. I just think that there is tremendous power in recognizing the essential nature of your labor.  Mike:   You need to know your with. I’m sorry, I'll stop now. I'll stop now. I'm sorry. That's the last one. I promise.  Sarah:   You can keep doing it, just don't ruin all of my poignant moments.  Mike:   You used to be charging $0.50 cents for a hundred poignant moments, and now it's $0.60 cents for a hundred poignant moments.  Sarah:   Yeah. So speaking of that pricing increase, I have a nice quote I want to review. This is from the new Irving Hall mass meeting rally that happens midway through the strike. At this point, the strike has grown very rapidly from an initial action in Long Island City, where some Newsboys toppled a distributor's card. And then turned the following day into a meeting of the Newsboys and lower Manhattan where they agreed to announce to Hearst and Pulitzer that if the price wasn't rolled back to its original price of $0.50 cents for a hundred papers instead of $0.60, then they were going to go on strike and the newspapers didn't take them seriously and so they did. And in a very short time were able to do exactly what they said they would.  So this is from Nasaw’s book,   Children of the City  ,   “For the boys and for the public who read about their strike, the highlight of the two weeks was the mass meeting held at New Irving Hall on Broome Street. Some 5,000 boys from all over the city showed up to shout their support. Early in the evening the Chairman, conscious of the effect favorable reports might have on building public support, asked the reporters present to please refrain from quoting the speakers as saying “these”, “those”, and “you’s”. Kid Blink, a strike organizer, urged the boys to stick like glue and a moment later, like plaster. Ain't that 10 cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer who are millionaires? Well, I guess it is. If they can't spare it, how can we. I'm trying to figure out how 10 cents on a hundred papers can mean more to a millionaire than it does to Newsboys, and I can't see it.”  What do you think about that?  Mike:   I actually find this, I don't want to say emotional, but I would say resonant of reaching back to really the same anger that these 16-year-olds had in 1899 is really, I mean, word for word, the same anger as we have.  Sarah:   Yes. ”I’m trying to figure out how 10 cents on a hundred papers can mean more to a millionaire than it does to Newsboys, and I can't see it.” To me it's important to just like, let the voice of Kid Blink speak today. So we're going to take a little ride by pigeon sort of like Feivel at an American Tale. We're going back in time, back to the beginning of Newsboys. I just need to talk about carrier pigeons for a second. Okay. So we're going to talk about Daniel H. Craig, who is the pigeon innovator.  Mike:   And the best James Bond.  Sarah:   “  As a young man, Craig apprentice in a newspaper office rather than go to work as a reporter for any paper. However, he saw that there was value in news as a commodity. He could collect news from other sources and sell it to those who bought and sold stocks and bonds, and who needed to anticipate how events might affect the markets. And the late 1830s he went to Baltimore, Maryland, where he became associated with Aaron S. Ebell the founder of the Baltimore Sun. Together. They experimented with using carrier pigeons to carry the news from Washington to Baltimore. Craig later took this technique north to sell news from Europe to Boston newspapers. The Cunard Line speedy shift's soft first in Canada, before sailing to Boston. The next day, when the steamers left for Boston, Daniel Craig would be on board carrying a basket of birds.  During the two-day trip he read all the European newspapers on board and printed the most important news on tiny pieces of tissue paper. He attached these reports to the legs of the carrier pigeons. When the Massachusetts coast came into view, he released his birds. They carried the news to Boston hours before the shift reached the city. When the birds returned home, Craig's wife, Helena - who we can picture looking like Helena Bonham Carter, why not - would distribute the news to their clients among the Boston papers and telegraph it to Wall Street brokers and New York papers, such as Gordon Bennet's Herald. The intensely competitive Bennett paid Craig a $500 bonus for every hour that he received European news ahead of the other New York newspapers.  When the other papers complained to the Cunard Line about Craig's unfair advantage, one ship captain seizes Craig's basket of pigeons. Anticipating such trouble, Craig had hidden one of the birds in his pocket. ‘I went on the deck and flew the bird close to the captain's head’,  Craig later recalled, ‘He darted into his state room and caught his rifle. But before he got a chance to shoot the bird was a mile above him, flying straight to his home in Boston, a hundred miles away.”  Mike:   Pigeons are lit. I didn't know, pigeons could go a hundred miles.  Sarah:   Pigeons are fascinating. And basically, from what I understand, they're trained to return to the same place. You know, you don't tell them to go somewhere. You just take them to any location, and they can find their way home.  Mike:   It's like a little homing beacon.  Sarah:   Pigeons carrying the news is wonderful to me. And also the idea that this was such a cutthroat industry and people were so desperate to get an edge over each other. And it was so important to get information from Europe, you know, an hour or two faster than the other guy. And that people had such an appetite and such need to know as soon as possible. I guess it's the original Twitter.  Mike:   Literally. It was the “meep, meep”, Twitter of actual birds.  Sarah:   I guess they go “coo coo”. It was “coo”. I think that humans are fascinating to study if you try to take the perspective of like, what about the things we do reveals what is important to us? And this is one of them.  Mike:   I think somebody should write a short story about using pigeons in war and call it “Military Coo”. So how do the Newsboys come out of this news industry with the pigeons and everything?  Sarah:   So the steam press is invented in the 1830s, and that's what makes it possible to produce newspapers on the scale that we associate with them today, like loaves of bread. Before that they have much lower circulations, they're more expensive to make, they're more expensive to buy. And the newspaper basically changes from something more like a magazine, like an issue of Vogue or something, into an object with greater freedom of movement. It's worthless monetarily, it appeals to more people. We're also seeing over time more newspapers, so you have all this choice as a consumer. According to DiGirolamo, we know the names of the first real Newsboys who were working without a wheelbarrow system. Because that's basically home delivery. They were hired in 1833 and some of their names are Bill Lovell, who is nine; Bernard Flaherty, who is 10; Henry Louis Gassert, who's 11.  Mike:   Those are young kids, dude! Nine to eleven?   Sarah:   Yes, young kids. And they respond to an ad that says,   “To the unemployed, a number of steady men can find employment by vending this paper. A liberal discount is allowed to those who buy and sell again.”  Mike:   They probably had a very good sense of the kinds of stories that sold, too. I mean, that seems like the kind of instinct that you would hone through years of sort of looking at one of those miserable front pages that we looked at last week and saying like, “Oh, this is the one that I'm going to cry out on the street.”  Sarah:   Newspapers that they knew what they were doing would listen to what Newsies said. And there was, I forget what paper this happened to but DiGirolamo talks about the fact that there was a paper that was running poetry, and at some point one or some of the newsboys were like, “He’s gotta stop because nobody buys poetry.” And they did. 13 boys, man.  Mike:   Thirteen boys, man. Yeah.  Sarah:   We talked a little bit last time about the kind of the constant verge of moral panic, feeling that a lot of the child welfare societies and advocates had toward Newsies and the 19th century. But also the idea that they had a troubling amount of agency because they like could earn profits and they could buy stuff that they wanted to.  Mike:   Right. They could get their own cronuts.  Sarah:   Yeah. Well actually, I have a quote for that. Are you ready> You just prompted me? This is great. Yeah. So this is about what kind of food are Newsboys eating in the mid to late 19 century, and how are people feeling about it  . “Each city had its specialties. Newsboys in Philadelphia were notably fond of clam soup, cheesecake, and mint sticks. Some skeptics felt that cravings for dainties, not real hunger, c  aused Newsboys to eat rather than save their earnings.”  Mike:   Oh my God.  Sarah:   Like, fuck off you guys.  Mike:   It’s an early glimpse of all of the moralizing around food that we would all become obsessed with about a hundred years later.  Sarah:   Yeah, exactly. Well, here, I'll read you a little more.   “Newspapers themselves offered dining options. The Tribune's basement was home to two eateries. The first, Butter Cake Dicks, was famous not only for its cakes and coffee, but also for its easy credit. The proprietor, Dick Marshall, had a soft heart for busted boys, but little patience for rowdies. The menu included cold pork and beans, cold ham, boiled eggs, rice pudding, and Connecticut pies, most famously pumpkin. Marshall refused on principle to stock graham crackers, which were invented by anti-masturbation campaigner Sylvester Graham, who condemned ‘exciting’ foods such as sweets, meats and coffee.”  That exciting is in quotes because the concept is that it literally excites your body. And Sylvester Graham would tell us that if we all ate bland foods that don't excite our bodies, then we can be celibate. And that's the goal, I guess.  Mike:   Isn't that the old quote about puritanism? That it's the fear that someone somewhere is having fun.  Sarah:   Yeah. I think puritanism was also about the freedom to execute people with impunity and stuff. But yeah, also that.  We are going to do a little bit of art history now. So we're going to talk about two paintings that are featured and   Crying the News  , and both are mid-19th century renderings of the Newsboys. So the first one is   Buffalo Newsboy  , by Thomas Le Clear.  Mike:   Oh, look at this little kid. So it's a young man, he's wearing sort of a cowboy-ish hat, he's got a green jacket on and almost like ski boots. Like big, thick, heavy boots. He's sitting on a crate of some kind and he's eating an apple with his left hand. Little southpaw in front of us. And the painter is going out of his way to tell us that this is a newsboy. There's newspapers sort of on the wall behind him. There's a newspaper at his feet. It's just a boy with a lot of news, is basically what I’m seeing.  Sarah:   I love that. A boy and his news. Yeah. And there's something about that that I find really resonant. And this feels like a really lovely, wholesome scene.  Mike:   Yeah. And also, he's eating an apple and not a cronut. So we've got all of our Puritan stuff about eating healthy in there, too.  Sarah:   Right. He's not eating an exciting food, so you know he's not going to be masturbating later. Okay.  And this is a   1849 Newsboy,   by Frederick R. Spencer. Look at this kid. Don't fuck with this kid, that kid ate a cronut for breakfast and he is not sorry.  Mike:   So this kid looks more sort of rough and tumble than the other kid. He's looking direct to camera with a sort of like, “You looking at me?” type of vibe. He's like a stocky kid. He seems to be layering up quite well. Maybe he's in the Pacific Northwest. And again, we've got a bunch of newsprint on the wall behind him. It's a boy amidst the news.  Sarah:   This makes me think of what happens to telephone poles now.  Mike:   Yes, it's also so interesting how our relationship with paintings is filtered through our relationship with cameras. Because it looks like this kid is having a photo taken of him, sort of against his will, or he's about to yell at the photographer like, “Hey, what are you doing?” But that's impossible then because they didn't have cameras.  Sarah:   You couldn't paint a painting that fast; I’ll tell you that much. That’s a little bit of trivia from someone who's been to grad school. I feel as if these two images kind of depict the two sides of the newsboy coin that people in the adult world are kind of wrestling with throughout the 19th century. At the time that Newsboys were omnipresent, people could not stop complaining about how annoyingly loud they were and how you could not make your way through a city without hearing the deafening call of the newsboy.  Mike:   This is also before the invention of the only two things that make being in public bearable, earbuds and Sigur Ros. You couldn't drown out the din of the Newsboys in the way that you could now.  Sarah:   Yeah. And then Newsboys also come to bear the associations that people have with what news media is to become. Because they basically are the messengers, and they get blamed for stuff.  The theory I want to advance here is that any time the sort of adults, mass media, the very media being sold by Newsies, is trying to take this attitude of concern about a group in society. Then that suggests a basic fear that they are amassing too much power for two legitimate reasons. Because something that I also find fascinating about Newsboys is that they had political power kind of throughout the sanctuary proceeding the strike. Not a lot, and not in any kind of a centralized way, but like they matter, they were important to the economy that they were working in. And if they refuse to distribute a certain paper that backed a candidate during an election season, then that candidate would suffer. And if they decided to affect an election then they could.  Mike:   Like Facebook, only if you were genocides.  Sarah:   So this is   footage   of actual Newsies taken in May 1899.  Mike:   I didn't even know they had cameras that early. Amazing.  Sarah:   Just barely.  Mike:   Oh, no sound though.  Sarah:   So it's a New York City street.  Sarah:   There’s a horse drawn cart coming in. That's the newspaper cart.  Mike:   And there's like, all these boys around it.  Sarah:   You see one has fell down.  Mike:   He just biffed like Maggie Simpson.  Sarah:   That's The World. They're picking up their copies of The World.  Mike:   Wow. It's so disorganized.  Sarah:   I know. It was like Fyre Fest.  Mike:   Yeah. They're like kind of pushing and shoving each other.  Sarah:   Yeah. Everyone wants to get in first. Yep. That's it. It's very funny to me to see footage of the 19th century.  Mike:   Yeah, it all has that weird sped up, like Charlie Chaplin feel to it. Which of course is not how people moved back then.  Sarah:   No, everyone just walked jerkily at the time.  Mike:   But like in my head, The World back then was in black and white and everybody just like walked at this weird joggy frame.  Sarah:   Right, right. Yeah. And in the fifties, everything was in really intense colors. And then in the seventies, things were grainy. So this is a song called,   The Boys in the Bowery Pit.   This is a song written for and about the extremely newsboy-dense audience for downtown entertainments in New York City in the late 19th century. Because Newsboys, I mean, in a way they're one of the first youth demographics and they're able to be catered to, because of how much power they have economically, relatively speaking.  There's a lot of media about Newsboys and the 19th century because Newsboys were consuming a lot of media and like to see stories about themselves. Like they read, they went to the theater. We didn't have the word teenager yet, but that's basically what they were, they're 16 or so and under, and they have money to spend. There as free as fishes, it sure beats washing dishes. Ain’t it a fine life.  Mike:   And their greatest risk to their mortality is masturbation due to cronuts.  Sarah:   Apparently. So here's the song,   The Boys in the Bowery Pit  , which was performed for the Newsies, and to read a claim by the Newsies, I think, because it was about them.  “I'm sitting in the Bowery it amongst the Gallus boys.”   Gallus means like brazenly adventurous.   “The Gallus boys are wide awake. They know what's coming now. For J.R. Scott is coming on and then there's such a row. Just at this time, a little boy climbs up upon his seat. And one behind who cannot see soon, knocks him off his feet.  A cry of “pass him round” then is echoed through the pit. And ground and lofty tumbling in no circumstance to it.”  Mike:   Roses are red, Newsboys drink ale. This will soon be a musical, starring a young Christian Bale.  Sarah:   Ahhh! That was so good. Oh my God.  Mike:   I think I fucked up some of the syllables. You get the idea.  Sarah:   Ok, Michelle.  Mike:   That's the cruelest thing you could possibly say to me about my rhymes.  Sarah:   No it’s not. Because you improvised poetry. It’s very hard to do.  So this lovely poem/song brings us back to what I think of when I'm told about Newsies going to see nightly entertainment, which is the Newsies strike rally at New Irving Hall on Broome Street, which is also featured in the movie   Newsies  . Would you like to see it?  Mike:   God, I forgot that there was a movie based on all this stuff. I got lost in the history, Sarah, I'm sorry.  Sarah:   I know. Isn't it great? I think we're selling ourselves short if we just think that it's wonderful enough that there's one movie all about newsboys. I think there should be a lot of movies about newsboys.  Mike:   Yeah. It's funny. I was just thinking, man, somebody should make a movie about this. And then I remembered what we're doing here today.  Sarah:   So I'm going to show you a video called, Spot Conlon Moments x3. The description says, “sorry, it's kind of poor quality because the clips are from my phone, but there aren’t many videos of Spot Conlon moments.” So I'm giving you that authentic experience. I'm excited. I've chosen to be excited about it. So I'm going to send this to you.  Mike:   I have no idea what I'm about to get into.  Sarah:   Thank you, Olivia. Thank you for uploading this video seven years ago. Spot Conlon, you might recall, was the leader of the Brooklyn contingent of the newsboys.  Mike:   Yes.  Sarah:   Yeah. You haven't forgotten Spot Conlon.   Mike:   God, these fucking names. It's like Newsboys and Twitch streamers have the most strict naming conventions. This looks like shit.  Sarah:   It's going to be great. This is what the situation is, Disney. Stop hiding your light under a bushel.  Mike:   Okay, here we go. Three, two, one, go.  *Audio plays*  “Well, we started the strike, but we can't do it alone. So we've been talking to other newsies all around the city.  So they told, what did they tell you?  They're waiting to see what Spot Conlon says. You're the key. That Spot Conlon is the most respected and famous newsie in all of New York, and probably everywhere else. And if Spot Conlon joins the strike, then we'll join it, and it will be unstoppable. So you gotta join us because, you gotta.  You're right, Jack. I got brains, too, and more than just half of them. How do I know you punks won’t run the first time some goon comes at you at the corner? How do I know you got what it takes to win?”  Mike:   Poor Christian Bale. He had to do this weird accent and he didn't even get to do anything weird with his body.  Sarah:   Maybe it's, I think it's good he didn't do that when he was a growing boy.  Mike:   That's his dream.  Sarah:   Not since   Good Fellas   have a bunch of New York accents had this much chemistry with each other.  Mike:   Seriously. Also they've got Christian Bale like that little hankie. He looks like a golden retriever. Yeah. It has like a nice Teen Beat kind of feel. Everybody seems non-threatening.  Sarah:   It’s because they're wearing 1899 clothes.  Mike:   That's true.  Sarah:   This movie is so good.  Mike:   And they keep saying “goon”.  Sarah:   A scab.  Mike:   I cannot believe this is a fucking Disney movie and you’re saying the word “scabs” to me.  Sarah:   The 90’s had some good stuff in there. Because seriously. Okay. So let's rewind. We've just had a journey Mike, you and I, because I showed you this video. Which is Spot Conlon moments, compiled by a Newsies fan and put on YouTube. And so what that means is that we open with the strike basically starting to get underway and the lower Manhattan Newsies venturing into Brooklyn to make a crucial alliance with Spot Conlon. And like, can you tell us what that scene feels like? Because I feel like the appeal of Newsies to me is very wrapped up in that scene individually.  Mike:   Well, it's hard to say because first of all, I couldn't hear a lot of the dialogue. Secondly, it wasn't totally clear to me what the context was. It seems like there were sort of different gangs, I guess, of Newsies. And he didn't want to join up with them because they're like different or whatever.  Sarah:   He sticks his neck out for no man. I think the feeling is just that like, if you're going to join a strike, you'd better be sure about it.  Mike:   That actually makes sense because on some level, because each of the Newsboys is an independent contractor, they're kind of in competition with each other. That if somebody else on a different corner sells all of his papes, those are papes that I'm not selling.  Sarah;   I love how much you love to say ‘papes’, because I love to say ‘papes’.  Mike:   But yeah, it isn't an industry structured to breed solidarity, which means that the solidarity that they formed is even more impressive.  24:31     Sarah:   Yeah. So back to the actual Newsboys strike. So we have the initial action in Long Island City. We have the meeting downtown in City Hall Park on July 19, and the decision to strike if the price isn't rolled back to $0.50 per a hundred papers. And the quote they get back from the world is, “Go ahead and strike.” So they do.  And this is when they decide to organize themselves the way that regular adult unions are organized. They send delegates to different neighborhoods. They do the kind of stuff that we see represented in Newsies, where they're paying attention to the politicking and setting up some kind of infrastructure for this movement, and also developing alliances with other cities. There's strikes in Massachusetts, there's strikes in New Jersey. And these boys have also had other strikes in the 1890s and before. Like this is a very strikey time.  So in real life, the primary leader sort of figurehead apparently for the strike is not Christian Bale, it's Kid Blink, whose real name is Louis Baletti. And Kid Blink is a real character in Newsies, but he's a side guy who's just sort of mostly, you know, he's there. And a kid named Dave Simons, who I must presume our pal David from Newsies is based on. And they're both 18 years old. A lot of the other Newsies in leadership positions are in their mid-teens. The adult unions are paying attention. During the strike, the socialist labor party has a candidate for governor who says, “  The capitalist class may well look to their defenses when five- and ten-year-old boys go out on strike against their infernal system.”   So I feel like there's this, this feeling among adults watching this, that, you know, maybe these boys that we feared are also capable of creating the society that we've all been incapable of creating. We're not doing it.  Mike:   Good marketing. Little kids fighting back against the system. I mean, it's a good story.  Sarah:   but yeah, a lot of people were on the side of the kids. And I do feel like more is possible when people are really hit over the head by the sort of moral clarity present in a struggle that is standing for other struggles that are maybe less advertisable. The fact that there's so much reporting on the newsboy strike in other newspapers at the time is also really interesting. Newsies also depicts accurately the fact that newspapers back off of this coverage after a time because the strike is starting to seem serious enough that it seems like it is threatening capital.  So on the 22nd, Hearst himself is spotted by the Newsies attempting to buy a paper in Herald Square, and basically, they chase him away. And then a bunch of Newsies also wait for Hearst in front of the Journal building. And when Hearst pulls up, they send out apparently one of the cuter Newsboys who says,   “We're the strikers, Mr. Hearst. We want 100 papers for 50 cents. We get it from the other papers except The World.”   And so he invites the Newsies up to come discuss it with him. And so Kid Blink, Dave, and a couple of other delegates come up and talk with him. So here's what Kid Blinks says about the meeting when he describes it to the other Newsies;  “He wanted to know what The World is going to do. I told him that we was dealing with The Journal now, and that if he cut, The World would cut quick enough. He says he had to talk it over with some other guys before he gives an answer. And I then asked him if he would arbitrate, like his paper says. He laughed and said he'd give us an answer Monday right here.  And so on Monday, The Journal and The World hire scabs and pay them $2 a day to sell newspapers. So that's their negotiation. Good job.  Mike:   That's their   Empire Strike Back   move.  Sarah:   It speaks to the idea that they're not taking these kids seriously. They're pretending to and hoping that's enough, and then deciding to crush them with scabs.  So following this, they have their Irving Hall rally, where they discuss what are they going to agree on that they will and won't do. Which includes Kid Blink telling everyone, “A fellow can't soak a lady.”  Mike:   What does that mean?  Sarah:   Soaking means beating someone up.  Mike:   Oh yeah, don't do that.  Sarah:   And this is given after, according to one newspaper, an old lady has been selling newspapers and breaking the strike by doing so. And are harassed by Newsies that take off her blouse and skirt, and then hoist them atop the flagpole and wave them around.  Mike:   That’s horrible, someone explain labor rights to her.  Sarah:   And at the Irving Hall event where he says, “Ain't that 10 cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer who are millionaires?” Kid Blink wins best speech, and he gets one of those flower horse shoes that they have at the racetrack, I guess.  Mike:   What? So it's like a Miss America situation. People are getting awards.  Sarah:   At least Kid Blink is. Yeah.  Mike:   Funniest, best hair, most romantic.  Sarah:   The homecoming strike rally. Yeah. And in Newsies this scene as a real turning point because the sort of dramatic action for Christian Bale's character is that he escaped from the house of refuge. Which is a real place where “juvenile delinquents” were sent in New York City at the time and were basically you were given hard labor to do. Because selling newspapers is bad, and doing hard labor is good for children.  Mike:   Yes. Then as now.  Sarah;   Yeah. But in real life the rally is this lovely occasion where obviously it's going on and there's a lot of controversy. And it's hard to decide the soaking women issue, perhaps for some I imagine, but in the movie, this is where the police come and do a big raid and arrest everybody and put the vice on the Newsboys and take Jack Kelly back to the house of refuge.  Mike:   But does this happen in real life? Are they raided in real life?  Sarah:   It does not happen in real life. And the fact about the Newsboys strike that I think the movie Newsies had the hardest time digesting, is that Hearst and Pulitzer attempted to and appeared to have been successful in their attempt to buy out Kid Blink and David Simons.  Mike:   Oh, wait…so they paid off the strike organizers?  Sarah:   Yeah. So in real life, the rally goes great. There's 5,000 Newsboys there. The strike is apparently growing stronger. And Hearst and Pulitzer pay $300 and $600 to Kid Blink and David Simons to get them to call a truce and call them, get a ‘do over’, stop the strike.  And so on July 26, they go to talk to the other Newsies about it. And Kid Blink, according to the news sported a new suit of clothes complete with straw hat and russet shoes and unwisely flashed a roll of bills. The strike committee put the pair on trial for high treason and low bribery. Kid Blink eloquently maintained their innocence. Both escaped conviction but were removed from office. A mob of Newsboys chase Blink through the streets that night. He escaped only by getting himself arrested.  Mike:   Wow. That's a very sad ending to the story.  Sarah:   This is not the end yet. Don't worry.  Mike:   Okay. That's a very sad Act Three twist to the story.  Sarah:   And in the movie we got the scenario where like he’s Jack Kelly, he's escaped the house of refuge, the stakes are really high. His dream is to get to Santa Fe, which is also a theme in the life of real Newsboys, that they can reasonably save up a relatively small amount of money and head west for a job in farming or buy land eventually and set themselves up as farmers. Which a fair number of Newsboys did over time. So the dream of going west is very real.  And so he allows himself to be bought off for like one second, and then he turns back around, and they do the banner together and they print the newsletter that's going to turn everything around. And everything's great and he doesn't get case down the street.  Mike:   Right. That's the Disney version of this, where he flirts with temptation, but ultimately doesn't give in.  Sarah:   It is, yeah. And let me actually, I have a thing to say about Newsies and money. So in 1875, Louisa May Alcott went to see the Newsboys lodging house in New York City, and she wrote a letter to her nephews about it.  Mike:   Wow.  Sarah:   Can you tell from the way I'm saying this, this is the most exciting piece of literature I could imagine coming across in my entire life? Louisa May Alcott, Newsboys.  Mike:   All you need is a serial killer in there and you're set.  Sarah:   This tells us a little bit about the indoor cats of the Newsboys. The indoor/outdoor Newsboys were living at the time, because a lot of Newsboys didn't stay in the lodging houses. I mean really the majority did not, but it was an institution that was available for the latter half of the 19th century.  I'll start us with her noticing,   “One little chap, only six. He was trotting around as busy as a bee, locking up his small shoes and ragged jacket as if they were great treasures. I asked about little Pete and the man told us his brother, only nine, supported him and took care of him entirely. And wouldn't let Pete be sent away to any home because he wished to have his family with him. How would it seem to be all alone in a big city with no mama to cuddle, you know, to grandpa's houses, to take you in not a penny, but what you earned and Donnie to take care of. Could you do it? Nine-year-old Patsy, does it capitally. Buys Pete’s clothes, pays for his bed and supper, and puts pennies in the savings bank. The savings bank was a great table, all full of slits, each one leading to a little place below and numbered outside, so each boy knew his own. One boy was putting in some pennies as we looked, and I asked how much he had saved this month. ‘$14. Ma'am’, says the 13-year-old, proudly slipping in the last cent. A prize of $3 is offered to the lad who saves the most in a month, and they also offer interest.”    So yeah, I think that is very interesting that like there is within this culture where the perennial fear is that they're buying sweets, and exciting themselves with exciting foods, and they're smoking cigars, and they're seeing shows. But there's also this apparently pretty strong culture of saving that's actually encouraged by the institutions that they're a part of.  Mike:   So if that kid was saving $14 bucks a month, then Kid Blink’s $300 bucks a month, it’s like a shitload of money.  Sarah:   $14 bucks a month for 12 months, so like two years, basically.  Mike:   Yeah. So no wonder they took it.  Sarah:   Yeah. I mean they're kids. When are they ever going to see a $600? This actually reminds me of an area that I'd also wanted to touch on. Which is the eternal question for me and others in the fandom, were there girl Newsies? And the answer that Vincent DiGirolamo has in   Crying the News   is,   “Yes. But everyone was scared of them and terrorized them all the time.”  Mike:   Wait, what? Why?  Sarah:   Okay. So here's a quote from Grover Cleveland, of all people.   “No pretext should be permitted to excuse allowing young girls to be on the streets at improper hours, since the result must necessarily be their destruction.”  Mike:   Oh, is it like a moral turpitude thing?  Sarah:   Yes.  Mike:   Like they're going to get tempted by drugs and candy sweets.  Sarah:   I mean basically the idea that people keep bringing up in this way that doesn't completely make sense is like, if a girl is a Newsie, then it's like, that's a gateway drug to sex work, basically.  Another quote, this is from a New York Police Captain,   “Girls who begin with selling newspapers usually end with selling themselves.”  Mike:   Oh God. Yeah. I mean, I guess like you said, it's independence. They can do what they want with their time and with their physical selves, and they can be in whatever part of the city they want to be in. And yeah. That's a slippery slope to a sex work, I suppose.  Sarah:   Newspapers, donuts, vice. Basically we all know that. I guess we need to associate newspapers with immorality again. I think that's another thing that would really help.  Mike:   The people who host the show already do, Sarah. We’re there.  Sarah:   Yeah, I guess I think the idea is that if you empower a girl to sell anything, then she is going to become scarily powerful.  So the day after Kid blink and David are found not guilty of treason, but booted from the union, The World and Journal offer to make a compromise and sell at $0.55 cents per hundred. And in these ways, [inaudible] says no. But they're starting to lose steam. And it's hard to say how significant the loss of their leader’s spokes boys was, but when the papers come back again two days later, July 29t and say we're going to stay at the current price, but you can return your unsold papers to us and we're going to refund you for them. Okay.  Mike:   That's great. Because that completely changes the risk calculus.  Sarah:   It does. Yeah. I think it is a victory, and the strike ends on August 1st.  Mike:   So ultimately it was roughly two weeks.  Sarah:   Yeah, a little less than two weeks. It's like uncommon.  Mike:   It's like a Baker's fortnight. I don't know what that means.  Sarah:   And after that, the Newsboys union goes on, but it becomes something with adult leadership, and it is basically no longer in the Newsboys hands and the way that it was. And actually this kind of connects to my feelings of ambivalence about the ending of Newsies. In the movie, as you and I both observed, all of these boys are having tons of chemistry with each other. And it's the kind of thing that if you like to ship couples as a teenager watching media, there's a lot of material there.  Mike:   Yeah, this is a ship factory. Ships coming off, the conveyor belt.  Sarah:   Was this movie made on the Great Lakes? Because it's a ship factory. And of course my ship, because I'm not that creative, is Jack and David. And at the end of the movie they resolve this plot line where Jack kind of joins David's family the first day that David works as a Newsie and comes in and meets David's parents and his sisters Sarah. And Jack and Sarah have “chemistry”, but they don't, because she's the only girl in the movie. And it's a movie that is obsessed with the joyful chemistry of boys having a strike.  And so at the end of the movie, the strike ends. They don't do the $0.60 cents and return paper thing. And then the papers decided that they would agree to the initial demand, and then the strike ended, and it was wonderful. And then Jack kisses Sarah. The End. And Spot Conlon rode off in Teddy Roosevelt's carriage. And Teddy Roosevelt is in it, by the way. There's a plot point where like they called Teddy Roosevelt and he's like, “This is terrible. We can't let children suffer this way”. Which   Crying The News   points out is probably inaccurate because Teddy Roosevelt advocated shooting strikers.  Mike:   So that's the Inglorious Basterds killing Hitler. They just put in a wish in the middle of the movie. It’s fine.  Sarah:   Yeah. Yeah. That's the most brazen inaccuracy. But yeah, and I think that ending is sort of weirdly bittersweet in the way that the actual ending of the strike is. Where it's like there was this moment when the strike was going on where anything was possible. And like maybe kid workers will rise together in solidarity and form their own kid workers union, like the IWW, but the kid workers of the world. And it won't be led by adults. And like what can happen when children are empowered to represent themselves? And what if the Newsboys have such power over these newspaper tycoons in such a shocking way that these tycoons failed to see coming at all. Like what if, what if that kind of power can be on earth in other fields? Never mind, it's over. Kiss a girl.  Mike:   I mean, it's like, I mean, I guess this happens a lot with these things that sort of reality comes bursting in like the Kool-Aid man. Ultimately, it's like, oh, the reality of it is just it's going to be a lot easier if we do this other thing, just less cool.  Sarah:   Yeah. I feel like this is sort of a growing up story, too. Because like the dream that you have as a child is that you make your demand and then the newspaper company is like, “Yes, I will meet your demand. We've had a struggle for about an hour and a half. I don't think I'm going to win this one. You can have the exact thing you asked for.” And in real life, you know, it's a really good outcome for you to ask for something and not get that specific thing but get something else that functionally gives you more security. And maybe it doesn't mean that you've won in the way that you might've hoped to win. And you reached a compromise, and you can move forward with your life.  Where we get stuck sometimes is feeling like if you don't get exactly what you would have initially hoped for at your most idealistic, then it's just not worth it. Which I feel like is this kind of like nineties liberalism sense of residedness that we talked about growing up with and around in the previous episode of like, “Unions don't work, kids. Kid Blink got bought out. Give it up, party's over.” And it's like, I don't think that something being spectacularly effective for a brief period, and then kind of crashing and burning, means that all effective things crash and burn. It means that it takes practice to move a movement forward. And that children representing themselves and anyone who represents the actual people whose conditions they're speaking about, seem to do well and seem to generate solidarity. At least in this instance. There’s nothing like solidarity. And like the fact that it is difficult and fleeting to cultivate doesn't mean that it's not worth it because,   “Every pape you tear out of a scab’s hands is worth something.”  Mike:     There's also the sort of overall context of the country in that there were a lot of desperately poor children who were willing to replace these laborers. I mean, this is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to get independent unions going in sweat shops. Because oftentimes they're an extremely poor countries where there really are a lot of desperate people who will work for low, shitty wages. Because that's the only option that's available.  Sarah:   Yeah. And also that they had this unusual situation where they were able to generate the kind of income that allowed them to strike, that they weren't all living hand to mouth. A lot of them were, but some of them weren't. And that freedom within an industry to perhaps get a little bit ahead, to get a little bit of a savings, even if you're living in a lodging house and considering yourself lucky to get a bath for free, you can still save up a little bit. Like if you are treated with a little bit of decency as a worker and are given some rights, then it makes it easier to demand more rights. Because like, if you have the energy to organize, then like, you will.  Mike:   Right. It's like how if one person learns a song and then another person learns it, and then they learn the choreography. And pretty soon everyone is dancing together.  Sarah:   And then Mike watches Newsies all the way through if he wants to. Not if it’s too awkward though. It's fine.  Mike:   That's what this was all leading up to, obviously.  Sarah:   Yeah. Maybe we can, you know, some dreams are out of bounds, but my dream of more people watching Newsies is possible.  I have one last journey to take you on.  Mike:   Oooh, take me.  Sarah:   Okay. So if this isn't too awkward for you, then nothing in Newsies will be. But we are going to watch Christian Bale's big song in this movie, which he I think worked so hard to sing and to dance to. And this show is about applauding people who do their best. So we're going to watch,   Santa Fe  .  Mike:   All right. Three, two, one, go.  *video plays*  “So that's what they call a family, mother daughter, father, son. I guess that everything you heard about is true.”  Mike:   This is very Disney.  Sarah:   Yeah, it's the “I want” song.  Mike:   Yeah. He's laying out his feelings.  Sarah:   It's also unfortunate that I think behind the scenes, they were like, “Christian, we have to get you looking as greasy as we can at all times. We want you sweating. We want you greasy.  Mike:   He's real wet.  “When I dream, on my own, I'm alone, but I ain't lonely. For a dreamer night’s the only time of day.”  Sarah:   He has the expression of a kid at sleepaway camp who wasn't told it was going to be for eight weeks.  Mike:   Yeah. He probably smells like Welsh cliffs, all the salt coming out of him.  Sarah:   They’re trying to get him to smell like cigarettes, but he just smells like a Welsh Merman.  “It's a feeling time can never take way. All I needs a few more dollars, and I'm outta here to stay. Dreams come true. Yes, they do.”  Sarah:   Oh God. I cannot believe they did this to him. Like adults all got in a room to edit this and felt okay going home to their families at the end of the day.  Mike:   I cannot believe he didn't know he was going to have to do this only.  Sarah:   If only he had a union to protect him. He does great though, right? Like this is hard.  Mike:   He seems like a guy that puts his all into everything.  Sarah:   Oh yeah. I mean, you can tell right. Because he's always gaining or losing 80 pounds.  Mike:   Yeah. People don't fight for the integrity of a   Terminator Salvation  , unless they take it really serious. Now he's on a fucking horse?  Sarah:   Yeah. He stole that horse. Cause Newsies are ruffians, you know, they'll steal your horse just so they can sing a song on it.  Mike:   The only time you ever see empty New York is in movies.  Sarah:   Yeah, when New York is in Burbank.  Mike:   Yeah. That was great. So far, my main takeaway from this movie is the absolute nightmare scenario of getting a job and then being told that you still have to do the job, but you also have to sing.   Sarah:   So in conclusion, do your best and be proud of it. We love you, Christian Bale. And maybe the thing about   Newsies   is that it's such a weird movie because it's trying to represent what should be an entire genre of media but isn't yet.  Mike:   Newsboy media?  Sarah:   Yes. Newsboy media. There's a whole world out there for us to explore, through all kinds of properties. But yeah, I mean, I guess I feel like dark and a light way to look at this, right. And to me, the dark way is like, oh my God, like we've gone backwards. And like this kind of worker solidarity seems harder to cultivate in American now than it did then, even though we're living in tomorrow land. Like, ugh.  But on the other hand, you give some teenage boys a place to sleep for $0.06 cents a night, a hot bath, and a piggy bank, and they threaten to overturn capitalism. So I don't know what would happen if he gave them two baths?  Mike:   And some cronuts.\""

       "'Sarah Marshall:  Could it be, I have like, this face that like, through no fault of my own, just looks permanently inquisitive. And that\\'s why my life has been this way. Welcome to You\\'re Wrong About. The show where we distract you from the horrible follies of today by talking about the horrible follies of yesteryear.  Michael Hobbes:  Oooooh! Yesteryear Follies. Those are our favorite.  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah. Yesterfollies.  Michael Hobbes:  I am Michael Hobbs. I\\'m a reporter for the Huffington Post.  Sarah Marshall:  I\\'m Sarah Marshall. I\\'m working on a book about the satanic panic.  Michael Hobbes:  And if you want to support the show. We\\'re on Patreon at   patreon.com/yourewrongaboutabout   and there\\'s lots of other ways to support the show. And I\\'m speeding through this again, because I want to tell Sarah about Shannon Faulkner.  Sarah Marshall:  I\\'m so excited.  Michael Hobbes:  So I texted you, I think like, three weeks ago now, and I was like, \"Sarah, do you know who or what Shannon Faulkner is?\" And you said, \"absolutely not.\" And then I basically instructed you to treat Shannon Faulkner the way I treat JonBenét Ramsey.  Sarah Marshall:  Which is funny because I have never told you my intentions to do a JonBenét Ramsey episode, but you just know that someday I will relent and do it. But yeah, I don\\'t know where this is going and I know that you\\'re very happy about that.  Michael Hobbes:  I\\'m so excited.  Sarah Marshall:  Okay.  Michael Hobbes:  So I think it\\'s important to cover Shannon Faulkner because she was sort of one of the canonically maligned women of the 1990s, but she was also double maligned because she was almost instantly and completely erased.  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah! She wasn\\'t on any of the VH1 countdowns.  Michael Hobbes:  Were you aware of this controversy over whether or not women could attend the Citadel?  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah. I know that there was--is it some military Academy in like, upstate New York or something?  Michael Hobbes:  South Carolina.  Sarah Marshall:  South Carolina. All right. Those are completely different places. I don\\'t know where I got that. Yeah. I know that that happened in the 90s and I feel as if the concept of women in military academies and women, just women in the military generally feels to me like, one of the issues that felt like it was really important and divisive in the 90s. And I feel like I grew up hearing a lot about secondhand.  Michael Hobbes:  Yes. Oh my God.  Sarah Marshall:  GI Jane, an iconic film.  Michael Hobbes:  We spent years debating this. This is one of the longest civil rights trials in US history. It\\'s also one of the most expensive. I mean, this to me is the progression that we\\'re going to track in this episode. And I think something really important about social change. So Shannon Faulkner tries to get into the Citadel. She can\\'t get in because she\\'s a woman. The case resolves itself in a very unsatisfying way, which we will get to. And 25 years later, for the first time, the Citadel has a female student body president. It\\'s called something different because there\\'s like, special names for everything there so it\\'s all military ish.  Sarah Marshall:  Right.  Michael Hobbes:  A journalist goes to this female student body president and says, \"well, you know, what do you think about Shannon Faulkner and this massive nationwide controversy?\" And this first female student body president says, \"who\\'s Shannon Faulkner?\"  Sarah Marshall:  Oh my. So there\\'s no Shannon Faulkner plaque. And no kind--that suggests that like the school--cause schools are so decisive in the lore that their students become adults by believing, you know, I mean the spirit of Thomas Jefferson is like, wandering around the grounds of UVA, probably drunkenly.  Michael Hobbes:  And there\\'s something I think about, sort of, fights for social justice, where entrenched institutions will fight and fight and fight. And the minute they lose, they\\'ll say, \"oh, we always wanted to do this. It\\'s not a big deal.\" And then of course we erase the entire fight and people who had their lives ruined, those are the first people to go. So that\\'s basically what this episode is about, is how all of this happens to Shannon.  Sarah Marshall:  Well, I\\'m so excited for this. It feels if I\\'m about to get on a slow dreadful rollercoaster.  Michael Hobbes:  It is low and dreadful, but it does have a happy ending.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh wow.  Michael Hobbes:  So I\\'ll just spoil it for you.  Sarah Marshall:  Okay. Well that almost never happens.  Michael Hobbes:  So, we\\'re going to start out with a scene. It is December of 1992, Shannon is in a social studies class. They are discussing a Sports Illustrated article that is about hazing practices at this military school called the Citadel. We don\\'t know a ton about Shannon and her upbringing and what she\\'s like. What we do know is she\\'s popular. She\\'s in the marching band, she plays sports, she\\'s an excellent student. Her mom is a high school teacher. Her dad runs a fence building company. The author of the book about her called In Glory\\'s Shadow, makes a big deal out of the fact that she was born prematurely. And she sort of, she was a fighter her whole life, which honestly feels a little like, a little projection to me of like, you don\\'t have much to work with.  Sarah Marshall:  I would be fine with never hearing another person described as a fighter ever again.  Michael Hobbes:  I know. This is an excerpt from a Susan Faludi essay in the New Yorker, which is one of the best essays about this case. She says, \"one could scrounge around in Faulkner\\'s childhood for the key to what made her take on the Citadel. But there\\'s little point in a detailed inspection of family history because there\\'s no real mystery here. What is most striking about Shannon herself is that she\\'s not particularly unusual. She reads novels by Tom Clancy and John Grisham, has worked at a local daycare center, is partial to places like Bennigans. She wants a college education so she can support herself and have a career as a teacher or journalist. She hasn\\'t yet decided which. She might do a stint in the military. She might not. She\\'s in many ways, representative of the average striving, lower middle-class teenage girl circa 1994, who intends to better herself and does not intend to achieve that betterment through a man. In fact, she has not for a moment entertain such a possibility.\" So this is something that comes up in a lot of the accounts of Shannon when she\\'s a kid. And also later on, that she doesn\\'t seem to give a shit what other people think. In contrast to a lot of the people that we\\'ve talked about on this show, she\\'s actually very clear about what she wants and very confident in asking for it. So there\\'s times later, when journalists will call her and be like, \"hey, you know, can I do an interview with you?\" And she just says like, \"no,\" and hangs up the phone.  Sarah Marshall:  That\\'s great.  Michael Hobbes:  So as they\\'re having this debate, the class seizes on this weird detail about the Citadel, that there\\'s only two all male military schools in America that are state funded. These are public institutions, that do not allow women. There\\'s one in Virginia. And there\\'s one in South Carolina, the Citadel. And Shannon immediately is like, \"my tax dollars are going to this school and I cannot attend. This just seems fundamentally like bullshit to me.\"  Sarah Marshall:  Does she live in South Carolina? Oh yeah, I guess she would. Cause then that\\'s why she\\'s entitled to an education there.  Michael Hobbes:  Yeah. She\\'s in Powdersville South Carolina, which is sort of across the state, the Citadel\\'s in Charleston.  Sarah Marshall:  Okay.  Michael Hobbes:  And so, this is December of her senior year and she\\'s sort of, in the midst of applying for a bunch of colleges for the following year. Two weeks later, she goes to the guidance counselor\\'s office, and she\\'s applying to four colleges. And so they fill out the first three applications and then Shannon tells the guidance counselor I also want to apply to the Citadel and the guidance counselor was like, \"but that\\'s only open to men.\" And Shannon\\'s like, here\\'s what I want you to do. She asks the guidance counselor to take all of her transcripts and all of the documents that the school has on her and white out all references to gender. So instead of being on like the women\\'s volleyball team, they whited it out so it just says volleyball team.  Sarah Marshall:  I love this. I already love this.  Michael Hobbes:  I know!  Sarah Marshall:  She\\'s running an experiment.  Michael Hobbes:  She also gets the guidance counselor to write her a recommendation letter with no pronouns.  Sarah Marshall:  Nice.  Michael Hobbes:  So the guidance counselor writes this very carefully. So it\\'s like, anything Shannon puts Shannon\\'s mind to Shannon can achieve.  Sarah Marshall:  Do we know very much about this guidance counselor who was in on this? Cause they seem really cool.  Michael Hobbes:  I love that all of the adults around her are like, this is troll-y, but also, go for it.  Sarah Marshall:  This is like tricksterishness motivated by a sense of injustice.  Michael Hobbes:  Yes. When her mom hears about this plan, apparently her mom just says, classic Shannon. She does this.  Sarah Marshall:  It all seems like fun and games until someone ends up in a three-year long civil rights lawsuit.  Michael Hobbes:  And also, it turns out that at the Citadel, a couple years previously, there had been a relatively well-known football player named Shannon. That\\'s not a super uncommon boys name. So the people at the Citadel see this application from Shannon Faulkner, they just assume, well, it\\'s obviously a boy because why the hell would a woman ever apply here? Everybody knows that women aren\\'t allowed in. So on January 22nd of 1993, Shannon Faulkner gets an acceptance letter that says, \"Dear Mr. Faulkner, welcome to the Citadel,\" basically.  Sarah Marshall:  Nice.  Michael Hobbes:  And so, the high school where her mom teaches, the assistant principal has a son who attends the Citadel. Shannon\\'s mom starts saying, \"LOL, my daughter got into the Citadel.\" Rumor of this goes through the high school. Then the rumor ends up with this, whatever sophomore at the Citadel. And so he is the one that then contacts like, the board of the Citadel and is like, \"uh, do you guys know that you admitted a woman?\"  Sarah Marshall:  Oh no.  Michael Hobbes:  And so two weeks after she gets the acceptance letter, she gets another letter revoking the acceptance. It\\'s written very dickishly. They send her a letter and then they send a separate letter in the same envelope to her mom basically scolding her. Like, why did you let your daughter do this?  Sarah Marshall:  Oh my God, she\\'s an adult.  Michael Hobbes:  And also, Shannon has now been accepted into the other three schools. I have no evidence for this, but it is very possible that if the school hadn\\'t revoked her admission, Shannon would have just gone to one of these other schools.  Sarah Marshall:  If I were her, my response would have been like, \"cool, that\\'s funny, I\\'ll go to wherever else I applied.\" But then if they revoke it, I\\'d be like, \"fuuuuuck you guys.\"  Michael Hobbes:  Yes!  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah!  Michael Hobbes:  So basically, classic Shannon, she goes through the Yellow Pages. She finds a civil rights lawyer like, this super awesome lady who does like abortion cases and stuff and walks her through the whole thing and says, do I have a case? And the lawyer\\'s like, yeah, I don\\'t see why not.  Sarah Marshall:  This is also the rare case of a malign 90s woman who wasn\\'t dragged into the spotlight by her bangs.  Michael Hobbes:  And so the first thing the lawyer does is she calls a press conference and that attracts the ACLU because remember how I mentioned, there\\'s only one other military institute in the country that is publicly funded, that doesn\\'t allow in women?  Sarah Marshall:  Yes.  Michael Hobbes:  That school is called the Virginia Military Institute and it\\'s getting sued by the Department of Justice for not allowing women in. And one of its main arguments is that there\\'s no demand to attend an all male military institution from women. So the ACLU is fighting back against this idea that there\\'s no demand from women to go to military institutions. And here comes Shannon, who is demanding to attend a military institution. And so the ACLU offers all of their legal services for free. So by the time they actually filed a case in March of 1993, she has eight lawyers.  Sarah Marshall:  It seems like a lot of big cases happen this way, where it\\'s like, you have a legal concept that you need to find a vehicle for.  Michael Hobbes:  Yeah.  Sarah Marshall:  And then the plaintiff is like, \"this person who, sort of, the luck of the numbers game of American populations, like, embodies the problems that you were trying to address.\"  Michael Hobbes:  Yes. And we all have to pretend that it\\'s about this individual when it\\'s very obviously about this larger issue and the precedent that it\\'s going to set.  Sarah Marshall:  Right. And where they have to be like, \"I volunteer as tribute.\"  Michael Hobbes:  So, what do you know about the Citadel? Have you ever heard of this before this controversy?  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah. I\\'ve heard that word. I know that the Citadel is a school that basically fought to keep women out, that\\'s really all. I know.  Michael Hobbes:  It\\'s also a very weird thing because, people are gonna get mad at me for this, but it\\'s sort of army cosplay.  Michael Hobbes:  I mean, West Point and these other official military institutions that we have in America are--they have official relationships with the military. It\\'s like a pipeline into the military. The Citadel is just its own thing. So only around a third of graduates end up going into the military.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh...  Michael Hobbes:  There\\'s all of this sort of pomp and circumstance within the school, like, the students have these ranks that are sort of quasi military ranks. And there\\'s this vocabulary that you have to use. And you have to stand at attention and say, \"sir,\" and all this kind of stuff, but those are just rules at the Citadel. They\\'re not in any way officially linked up to the military.  Sarah Marshall:  So it\\'s interesting that the school is like, silly and the lawsuit is kind of revealing their silliness in an uncomfortable way perhaps, cause they\\'re like, \"we can\\'t allow women in because it would interfere with the importance of us pretending to be soldiers.\"  Michael Hobbes:  Yes! It\\'s basically theater camp. So, I read two histories of the Citadel and most institutions in America. If you look into them, have pretty rough history. The Citadel has maybe has like, the worst history I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s like a fucking SNL sketch of like, how offensive can history be. So the school was founded in 1822 to respond to a slave uprising. It\\'s actually a bit of a You\\'re Wrong About.† The uprising was organized by a guy named Denmark Vesey. The narrative was always that this was a sprawling plot of all these people and hundreds were involved and it was this massive conspiracy. And when historians went back in the 1960s to actually look at the primary documents, they found that it was basically just a bunch of rumors. It wasn\\'t planned, they had no date. It was just something that they talked about as like, wouldn\\'t it be cool if. So academics now refer to it as a legal lynching where it was essentially just an excuse to execute Denmark Vesey and his quote unquote \"co-conspirators.\"  Sarah Marshall:  That\\'s awful.  Michael Hobbes:  So that in itself is a really gross story. But then what happened right after was there were all these vigilante squads that wandered around Charleston, like, burning down churches. And the reason the Citadel was founded was to train, quote, unquote, \"citizen soldiers to prevent any future uprisings of enslaved peoples.\" Like that was the point.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh my God. Well, do you see how like, letting a female student into the school with sully, beautiful history?  Michael Hobbes:  My God.  Sarah Marshall:  You\\'re right. I really was ready to be like, I don\\'t know, but like, yeah, Jesus Christ.  Michael Hobbes:  Eventually it turns into just a normal military college. And then according to its graduates, people at the Citadel fired the first shots of the civil war. I didn\\'t really look into whether that was true or not just because it\\'s like such a big part of the lore of the school that they\\'re really proud of this, which I feel like is like, that in itself is telling whether or not it\\'s true.  Sarah Marshall:  Right. Like, either it really happened or it didn\\'t happen and they thought it would be cool if it did happen.  Michael Hobbes:  Yes.  Sarah Marshall:  Most history is like, kind of made up, but then it\\'s more useful and revealing like, who the people telling it are.  Michael Hobbes:  Yes. So over time the Citadel becomes an increasingly closed loop.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh!  Michael Hobbes:  It becomes more conservative over time because the more it drifts away from the general progressiveness of the country, you know, 1960s, student protests, et cetera, it pushes back against all of these things. And over time it starts to attract students that are interested in this sort of increasingly archaic lifestyle and [inaudible].  Sarah Marshall:  It\\'s like 4chan.  Michael Hobbes:  It is! Like, it becomes this distillation chamber and also the alumni network. They also protect the school. So every once in a while, an outsider, a sort of reformer, will be appointed as the president and will try to institute reforms. And the entire alumni network threatens to pull donations.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh!  Michael Hobbes:  There\\'s also a series of scandals that make it even worse. So I\\'m going to send you a photo.  Sarah Marshall:  Okay. We\\'re looking at a photo of, it looks like a high school portrait of a guy who I got to say has like, young farmer in Babe energy.  Michael Hobbes:  Yes.  Sarah Marshall:  This looks like it was taken in the 60s or the 70s because I\\'m seeing kind of what looks like a loud patterned tie. And he\\'s got some thick glasses, some sticky out ears. And he looks just like a lovely and ungainly boy in a large man\\'s body of like 17 or 18.  Michael Hobbes:  This is Harry Delaroche. He is 17 when this is taken. He ends up getting into the Citadel. And the minute he gets into the Citadel, he experiences this absurd system they have of hazing cadets. It began as an explicit way to build solidarity and to build school spirit. So it used to be, they would give you this history handbook of the school and you had to basically memorize it. If you were a freshmen, you had to sort of stand at attention nd if an upperclassmen came up to you and was like, \"who was the president of the school in 1924?\" You\\'d have to say like, \"Norman Poindexter\" or whatever. And then they would correct you or not correct you.  Sarah Marshall:  You know what builds school,spirit? Acapella. Acapella builds school spirit, try harmonizing with someone you don\\'t trust.  Michael Hobbes:  I mean, it ultimately seems very silly to me, but also it was designed as something that would be sort of shared knowledge between students at the school, like a way of developing, like, an inside language for people within this institution. But so what happens is over time, this hazing just becomes more and more brutal. And also because it\\'s a closed loop, whatever you experienced as a freshmen, you\\'re going to do to the freshmen when you\\'re a senior. So the first week of school is known as \"hell week.\" And by the time Harry Delaroche gets there in 1976, it\\'s just like, beatings and stuff. It\\'s not creative?  Sarah Marshall:  This is the most you criticism I have ever heard. I love what you\\'re saying, which is that obviously it\\'s horrible, but also they\\'re not even doing what they said they were doing.  Michael Hobbes:  Right?  Sarah Marshall:  What happens? What kind of stuff do kids have to endure?  Michael Hobbes:  One of the things that happens to Harry is they cut his shins with a razor blade and then they pour shoe polish on them.  Sarah Marshall:  They\\'re like, \"I can\\'t cut your face cause you got to go work the streets tonight.\"  Michael Hobbes:  I mean, a big thing is sort of keeping your shoes polished and keeping your uniform crisp and tight. And so this, I believe, is a punishment for having scuffed shoes. Another big thing is technically upperclassmen have the right to take away food from freshman. So if an upperclassmen demands food, you have to give it over.  Sarah Marshall:  No!  Michael Hobbes:  So, for weeks, Harry just isn\\'t eating, because every time he sits down to eat in the cafeteria, some upperclassmen comes and takes away his food.  Sarah Marshall:  You know what\\'s funny, is that like, when I was a teenager, I think this stuff didn\\'t hit me as hard because I was like, I\\'m basically an adult. And now that I see teenagers as children, I\\'m just like, how are adults condoning this?  Michael Hobbes:  I know... I mean, at various points, the teachers try to push back against this because the teachers are like, people are coming to class and they haven\\'t eaten and they haven\\'t slept.  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah. How the hell are people learning anything?  Michael Hobbes:  Again, closed loop. A lot of the adults in the administration, they went to this school. They think that it builds character. And not only is it not seen as a problem, this is seen as an essential component of masculinity. You have to experience abuse.  Sarah Marshall:  You know what builds character? Working in a waffle house, do that. Those people can deescalate like nobody. I think that the thing that we think of as masculinity is something that you basically need to be abused to become, but that\\'s not actually a masculinity. It doesn\\'t relate to being male. It just relates to having been abused. And we just confuse the two things.  Michael Hobbes:  So, Thanksgiving of his first year, Harry, he says that his mom has terminal cancer and he has to go home for Thanksgiving early. He\\'s lying just to get out of the school. And once he gets home, he sort of, in his head has decided he\\'s not going to go back to the school. He\\'s like, I can\\'t take this anymore. But because his dad is like this military asshole, he\\'s got a history of abusing Harry, it\\'s really terrible. He\\'s not going to let him quit. And so brace yourself, Harry Delaroche murders his entire family.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh wow. Yeah.  Michael Hobbes:  He kills his mom and his dad and his two brothers. Because this is such a huge national story at the time, it contributes to the closed loop nature of the Citadel because who wants to apply to a school where the hazing practices are so severe that they lead to an outcome like this. It\\'s only going to be people who don\\'t see the hazing as a deal breaker, or are specifically attracted by the hazing. This closed loop thing gets even worse in the 1980s.  Sarah Marshall:  Like everything!  Michael Hobbes:  The school started allowing in black students in 1966, but it did so very quietly. The school was never more than 5 or 6% black.  Sarah Marshall:  What\\'s their student body on the whole? Is this in like the low thousands? How big is it?  Michael Hobbes:  2000 students total.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh, that\\'s small.  Michael Hobbes:  So in 1986, there is a student named Kevin Nesmith who is black. And this is super fucked up. A bunch of upperclassmen think that he\\'s like, not pulling his weight. So, as a quote unquote galactically large fucking quote marks, \"prank.\" They dress up in Klan robes and go into his room at night with a burning cross.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh my God.  Michael Hobbes:  He is okay. Nothing really happens. They sort of go in there and they shout at him and his roommate who is white, wakes up and is like, you\\'ve got to be fucking kidding me. Get the fuck out of here. And like, it\\'s just chaos. This also becomes a national story because it\\'s fucking outrageous. Kevin ends up quitting the school pretty soon after because yes, of course.  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah...  Michael Hobbes:  Meanwhile all five of the kids who dress up in Klan robes as a quote, unquote \"prank\" end up graduating. They\\'re not given any major punishment.  Sarah Marshall:  This is the kind of wonderful culture that a female student body might challenge, you know, you just can\\'t like girls and they\\'ll ruin everything.  Michael Hobbes:  What\\'s so fascinating about this is that this also ends up reinforcing the closed loop thing because what happens to minority enrollment after this? Black people basically stop applying to the school, cause of course they do.  Sarah Marshall:  Yeah. If you have a hundred black students sprinkled into a culturally white institution, the culture can remain fundamentally the same. It seems like.  Michael Hobbes:  Exactly. And I just think there\\'s this kind of cultural stereotype that as the country becomes more progressive, all of these conservative institutions will sort of inevitably come along, like, you know, be dragged by the tide of history or whatever. But what we tend to see is that a lot of these institutions actually become more conservative because they feel like they\\'re the only ones left. So by the 1990s, by the time Shannon applies, it\\'s actually like part of the school\\'s identity that we\\'re one of the last schools to not allow in women. Like, that\\'s actually a huge draw for students and like, a big part of the way that they think about themselves.  Sarah Marshall:  It\\'s not a cute look.  Michael Hobbes:  It\\'s not cute. So, next section. We\\'re eventually gonna talk about the court case, but there\\'s about six months before the court case really happens. There\\'s all these sort of preliminary hearings and motions, blah, blah, blah. What happens almost immediately after Shannon files the lawsuit is that she becomes a massive celebrity.  Sarah Marshall:  Oh my.'"
