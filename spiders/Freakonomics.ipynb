       "   'KURTH: Yes. I do predominantly preventive medicine. I do a lot of checkups and things that are done in a fairly routine fashion. What happened at the end of March is I went from having a few conversations with people who were having fever to having eight to 10 patients a day calling in with symptoms that were concerning. And I would say of my practice of about 1,000 patients, 50 had Covid-related illness. I spent a lot of time basically talking to people on the phone. The last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April were the peak time here in New York City.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And at what point did you stop going into your office to see people and handling this all electronically?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: Well, I never stopped going into my office because I live within walking distance of my office. My office manager and I worked the entire time. It was also easier for me to be in my office in what I felt was my command central when I was handling all the phone calls. I had very quick access to my electronic health records. I was able to use my office as a reassuring background for any video calls that I had with patients. And it just allowed me to kind of stay focused. So, I would do an initial consult, a telemedicine consult, and then I would create my list of phone calls of people who I would call and follow up on over the next day or two or a week or two.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I should say we were on your daily call sheet for a while. We had illness in the family during that time, which was pretty concerning, especially because in New York City the big concern was if you go to the hospital, what’s going to happen there? And so, we were talking to you every day for, it seemed like typically 20 to 30 minutes.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: So, what happened with Covid, and the hard thing for physicians is that there was so much uncertainty, and there was a sense that there wasn’t much we could do other than maybe manage some of the other medications that the patient was taking, or maybe listen and see if on top of a viral infection, they were developing bacterial infections, or pneumonias, or sinus infections, or ear infections. So, every day I felt the follow-up phone calls — they were to reassure the patient, but it was also for me to learn more about the illness and what was happening and then to make micro-interventions to maybe prevent things from getting worse.',\n",
       "   'KURTH: What I saw in mid-April is that the Covid calls went way down, but the calls for other types of problems began to increase.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: I think the thing that made me go immediately to telehealth was the news that Angela Merkel was in quarantine because her doctor had tested positive for the virus. And the idea of a physician or a physician’s office being a vector of illness is kind of creepy. That you go to a place to get help and you get sicker.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: I enjoy seeing their homes. And I’ve met their pets and I’ve seen the children running in and out of the screens.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: People were wanting telehealth visits for low back pain. They wanted it for shoulder pain. They wanted it for a rash that they had developed. They wanted to simply go over their blood-pressure medications because they hadn’t seen me in a few months. And it actually became quite enjoyable. Back pain is actually quite easy to do with a video camera. You can do all of the exam. You can phone in the prescriptions. No labs or x-rays are often needed.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Can you give me a quick list of the things that, going forward, cannot and will not be done via telehealth?',\n",
       "   'KURTH: So, earache, you’ve got to look at the ear. It could be wax. It could be anything. That’s a simple thing. Abdominal pain. I did a couple of telehealth, but I certainly knew when I was going to need to get some blood work or other x-rays. Tough ones are fatigue or malaise. You can start the conversation over the phone, but it’s hard to complete it. Chest pain and acute stroke symptoms, really need to go to the emergency room. There were two visits during the pandemic that I converted from telehealth to actual office visits because I felt that I was at risk of not getting it right on the phone or by video. And I actually brought the patient into the office with all protective gear because I felt it was essential. And I was safer than an emergency room at that time.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: For me, it’s the sick visits that I actually could easily do over the phone because they usually have algorithms. Back pain has an algorithm. A number of things like headache, sleep disturbance, you can actually do those things over the phone because they don’t require as much of a physical exam. For annual checkups we could do certainly the screening questions over the phone. So, I would say looking next year, I would expect that 20 to 30 percent might be done over the telephone, and office hours would be more restricted.\\xa0',\n",

It can come in the form of an email. It could come in the form of a picture. A good example would be in dermatology, where you could take a picture of a rash and send it to a dermatologist and the dermatologist can reply without actually having to talk to you, and give you a prescription for it.\\xa0',\n",

When a patient is diagnosed with the stroke, how quickly they’re started on medications impacts their function after that stroke. And so, if a patient is having a stroke in a small, rural hospital and there’s no neurologist that’s around, you can use video conferencing to get a neurologist in the room to diagnose that patient within seconds and then start that patient on medications within minutes so that they can have the best functional outcome from their stroke.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: No. 2 was that patient privacy rules were relaxed. And what that means is that prior to the pandemic, there was a requirement that the software that you use, the equipment that you use, has high levels of security required by the law called HIPAA. And so, during the pandemic, there were some relaxation of these rules just so they can enable patients and providers to ramp up quickly.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: The No. 3 was that payments for telehealth services were essentially made comparable to in-person visits. This is especially true for phone calls, which typically were either not reimbursed by payers like Medicare or were reimbursed at low levels.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: No. 4 was that there was relaxation of medical licensure rules. What this means is that many state governments and the federal government also said it would be okay to practice across state lines. ',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: And then, finally, the other big change was that practices were essentially given the power to waive co-pays for patients. And that’s really important because it incentivizes patients to use these visits versus in-person care.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: The key missing ingredient had always been the financial one. It was not the technological one, because as we’ve learned, it’s easy, relatively easy to do. It was not the desire of patients because as we’ve learned, patients would like to do it this way. It was the financial issue.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: Insurance coverage for telehealth was fragmented. There were some private payers that were reimbursing for telehealth visits. The Medicare program was not at that time — or there was at least a significant regulatory burden on how a telehealth visit could be conducted. And so, that sort of fragmentation leads to confusion among patients, confusion among providers, which just inherently leads to lower rates of adoption.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'KURTH: April was a brutal month. It was a 75-percent reduction in revenue, even though I was doing eight telemedicine visits a day and probably 10 non-charged phone calls, which were my own neurotic follow-up phone calls. I bill by 10-minute intervals. But you don’t bill the same way when you’re not fully present in a room with somebody.',\n",

       "   'CUTLER: That’s a political-economic decision. Congress might get involved as well. My hope is that they will continue to reimburse telehealth. Certainly there haven’t been stories about widespread abuse of telehealth that might indicate we’ve got to be careful here.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: What kind of abuse would one fear?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: Anytime that you have someone taking care of a patient or claiming to take care of a patient, you always need to be sure that that actually occurred. There was a good deal of home-health fraud that was about bills that were submitted for home health where people suspected no actual home health care was provided, that it was entirely a scam to submit bills. There is a seamy underside of a lot of medical care like that.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: I think what happened was there were no doctors yelling and screaming, “You have to create this telemedicine thing because I’m desperate to do it.” And so, C.M.S. listens to where the yelling and screaming is. And the yelling and screaming is coming from the specialists who say, “Oh, we’ve got a new way of treating X, you’ve got to find a way to reimburse X.” And so, there’s this tendency to focus on where the hockey puck is and not where it’s going.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Talk about the other economic decisions being made, including —\\xa0I’m really curious to know about private insurers.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: So, private insurers are in a very interesting position. So, on the one hand, the use of medical services has plummeted. Absolutely plummeted. People are not going to the doctor. People are not going to the hospital. There are fewer people showing up with strokes and heart attacks. ',\n",
       "   'So, on the one hand, that was like a bonanza for private insurers because their business models take in premiums and pay out claims. And if nobody’s making claims, then you’re taking in premiums and not paying out. ',\n",
       "   'On the other hand, they had businesses and individuals who were writing them checks who are saying, “I can’t pay you now. My business is shuttered. I can’t pay you. As an individual, I can’t pay you.” So, on the revenue side, they were losing a lot as well. Most insurers are in this tricky spot where in the short term they’ve been making a lot of money because they haven’t been paying out. They’re now, if you will, extending loans to businesses. And they’re wondering, is that care that was deferred going to come back and bite us? So, all those people who didn’t go to the doctor for X, are they going to show up in the fall next year? ',\n",
       "   'They don’t really know about this. If they get very nervous that people are going to have all these elective surgeries, that doctors are going to make up for a couple of months out with a lot of billing, then they’re going to return to clamp-down mode. So, they’ll say, “We have to get a handle on expenses. We have to impose more drug co-pays. We have to stop this telemedicine thing. We have to do all these things to try and bring our costs under control.” If they don’t need to do that, if utilization stays low, if people come back and can pay their insurance premiums and so on, then the insurers will be in a much better position to say, “You know, this actually turned out okay, and we’re willing to go with this and let’s figure out how we work this into routine care.',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: And that reluctance and that resistance to change is a big problem in health care. As someone who is working to expand the use of telehealth, just getting providers to do a video conference with a patient that is eight hours away, is hard enough to build that into workflow. Providers and patients across the country were able to see what the value and the benefit of telehealth was during this time, where they really didn’t have any other options.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: It strikes me that telehealth has been the future for a long time, and then suddenly in the course of a month or two, because of Covid-19, it became the present. Really, what I want to know is, is it also the future? In other words, is it going to stick?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: I think it’s going to be sticky to some degree. I think that this spike is probably the highest level that we’re going to get to for a while. After the pandemic is over, as health systems start to ramp up in-person care, we’re going to see telehealth drop, and it’ll drop to some baseline level that was much higher than it was prior to Covid, but it won’t be at the levels that it was during the pandemic.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: If this goes as you would like it to go, what share of in-person medical visits as of 2019, let’s say — right before pandemic, what share of those will convert to telehealth visits by, let’s say, 2025?',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: I think that the right number is probably about 25 percent. I really think that the old model of bringing patients in for every medical reason is over. And now that there’s been that exposure to telehealth, a lot of specialties will be redesigning care.',\n",

       "   'CUTLER: The first one is the administrative cost of running the health-care system. In most countries, they just say to the physicians, “Here are the resources that we have, you make do with them.” And that’s not a very expensive way to do things. In the U.S. we don’t say that. We say, “You can have whatever equipment you want, but we’re going to question every single time you want to use it.” The net effect is we spend an enormous amount of resources adjudicating when is it appropriate to use care or not. That’s very, very costly.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: The same provider of care — think about pharmaceutical companies — gets paid more for selling in the U.S. than in other countries. Drugs are more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries. So, by the way, are physician visits for the same thing, more expensive in the U.S. than other countries.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: The typical visit to a medical-care institution is more intensive in the U.S. than it is elsewhere. It’s likely to involve additional testing, maybe hospitalization. And a lot of that care is not really so essential. It’s done because the physician just wants to be sure, sometimes because he or she is afraid of being sued, sometimes because there’s an empty hospital bed, so you might as well use it.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: When you break it down into those three areas, does telehealth — if it were to, let’s say, double, triple, quadruple over the next five or 10 years — does that do anything to significantly lower those costs?',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: One thing that it does, which is independent of cost, is it just makes the medical system more convenient for people. One of the big frustrations about medical care in the U.S. is that people have a very, very difficult time using it and accessing it and getting to where you need to and the physician visits and all of that. So, we shouldn’t underestimate the poorer outcomes that result from having a system that’s difficult to use.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: So, the telemedicine visit doesn’t need to be as high. My sense is that something like 85 percent of an in-person visit is roughly the cost that’s needed, because you don’t need the staff and you don’t need the office space.',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: I would play a little devil’s advocate here and say that it’s not necessarily cost savings.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: There are kind of two ways to look at it. One is that it is cost savings because it reduces that in-person clinical footprint. It reduces overhead costs. But on the other hand, it actually can be — you can lose revenue through these visits. And so, there’s this concept of payment equity, which means that it’s not just is the visit reimbursed at the same level, but it’s also about all the additional services that come with in-person care.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Do you mean, upselling, essentially? Like I go for my physical and I get asked, “Do you want not only the flu vaccine, but the pneumonia vaccine, too?” that kind of thing?',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: So I don’t know if it’s so much upselling as it is kind of the services that you receive out of convenience. Let me give you an example in my practice. When we see patients in person for urologic care, we typically start the visit by collecting a urine sample and running a urine-analysis test. And so, that urine-analysis test, I’ll take a look at, I’ll make sure t',\n",
       "   'However, does every patient need that particular screening modality? I mean, we do it because they’re there and it’s quick and it’s easy and it helps us with our management, but it may be considered low-value care or a low-value test. Those are the kind of things that practices make money off of, so that the total reimbursement for a patient may actually be lower with telehealth visits than it is with in-person care.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But it sounds like the concern from the health-care provider may be that it really strips it down to the essentials, that even if reimbursement is commensurate with in-person reimbursement for certain activities, there are other activities that just won’t be happening at all, that you won’t be able to charge for. Is that right?',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: That’s 100 percent correct.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: The biggest source of spending in health care is when people get very sick, so they wind up in the hospital, they’re in intensive care, they’re in rehab and acute-care facilities, post-acute care facilities. If you want to reduce spending in medical care, get people out of institutions. That is super expensive. Most anything you can do that prevents that will save money.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: One of the shames about prevention is we know how to do it and it’s still woefully underdone. Only about half of people with high cholesterol or hypertension are successfully treated. If you can use telehealth to do that, you can both improve people’s lives and save money on things like heart attacks and strokes and related conditions. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, the complaint from providers is always — well, the complaint from everyone really — is always that prevention is not monetized, you’re not incentivized, and that procedures and treatment are. Can you see a way in which telehealth, and all that includes — apps that have a pulse-ox, smartphones are really, really smart when it comes to health care — can you imagine a way in which telehealth is an avenue for a huge increase in preventive care?',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: Yes, I can. A lot of preventive care involves regular activities on the part of people, but that it’s easy to slip up. So, for example, I need to be taking medication regularly for someone who has a particular condition. But if you forget to go to the Walgreens that month or that week, then you don’t have it. Maybe actually the right way to care for yourself at home is with telemedicine and C.V.S. or Walgreens. You know, coming in and delivering your diabetes test strips and making sure that your high blood pressure monitor is accurate and so on.',\n",

The fax machine seems to exist, at the moment, only for health care. So, I think of telehealth as one part of a system that we know should work differently than it does.

That is going to be a big way that certain types of conditions, like congestive heart failure, diabetes, those conditions can be managed where physicians are essentially managing an entire panel of patients just by looking at their data. And that’s also where these new concepts like artificial intelligence can come into play, where the big part of remote monitoring is being able to sort through lots and lots of data to be able to come up with clinically-appropriate solutions and red flags for patients.',\n",

And then the fourth area would be patient experience.

So, in other words, if I feel that there’s huge value in seeing my doctor in person because there are things that can be done diagnostically, whether it’s physical examination, whether it’s a sort of conversation, whatever, or maybe how the data are are gathered, collected, and analyzed.

       "   'ELLIMOOTTIL: Yes. That’s a good question. There’s certain things that we know from smaller sized studies, pilot studies, single institution studies, and what we don’t know is really the population level effect. And so, let’s just go to the chronic disease management of congestive heart failure. That’s one area that has been studied very well with a lot of randomized control studies that have found that using remote monitoring, checking patients’ weights at home, and adjusting their medications can keep them out of the hospital, can shorten their stay inside hospitals, and can actually decrease mortality as well. And so, that’s one area where remote monitoring works well. ',\n",
       "   'In diabetes management, remote monitoring has been shown to, in randomized control trials, to be associated with lower rates of hemoglobin, A.1.C.’s. There is some strong data in selected areas. But in terms of, “Will a patient’s outcomes from a cancer diagnosis be improved because of early detection?” We don’t know the answer to that yet because it just hasn’t been used in oncology at a population level where we can actually assess that particular outcome.',\n",

       "   'CUTLER: Correct. There’s a fact about medical innovation which is relevant here. Almost every medical innovation first diffuses to people who are better off and then diffuses to people who are worse off. So, you see that with new drugs, you know, new drugs for H.I.V. first get taken by higher-income people and then they spread to lower-income people and people in lower-income countries. Same is true with antihypertensives, cholesterol drugs and so on. It may very well be that telehealth and its related innovations happen first for people in cities, and rich providers and so on.

       "   'CUTLER: That’s an interesting question. It’ll depend on a couple of things. One thing that will happen is that the physical space and the office personnel may shrink some. If you’re, for example, a landlord renting to medical offices, they may not need as much space. And if you’re in the medical-record business or in the office-support business and there’s no office to support, then you may be out of a job. So, those would probably be the biggest losers. ',\n",
       "   'The winners — some physicians will turn out to be winners because really what they want is actually a more flexible schedule, too. And so, being able to do the telemedicine version may actually work out well. Patients could very well be winners, too. Depending on how much more we spend in primary care relative to what we save, the spending balance could go up or down. My own personal thought as we’re talking about it is that over time, technology from telemedicine and other things ought to be able to lower spending. But there’s a possibility, certainly in the short run, that it would increase spending.',\n",
       "   'The bad way to say it is never waste a crisis. The good way to say it is people, doctors, patients, health-care systems are now open to more change than they’ve been in some time.',\n",

The first one is you’re going to come in, in the middle of a continuing recession — hopefully it’s not a depression —\\xa0 where people are going to be without coverage or they’re going to have lost the coverage they like, and they’ll be searching around for coverage. And so, you’re going to have to do something to help people. So that’s item one. Item two is that medical care is too expensive, and the expense hinders people from seeking medical care.

       "   'CUTLER: There’s an issue as to whether the next president, if it’s President Biden, should take a big swing at medical care or should take a medium swing at medical care. A big swing would be something like Medicare-for-All or get rid of private insurance and some combination like that. And a medium swing is patch up the A.C.A. and focus on costs. There are other issues that we need to address, too. At a time where the capital of the president is at its highest, I don’t know that I would recommend going all in on the big swing for health care, spending the first year and a half on that and not addressing wage inequality and cities coming apart and racial issues and pandemic and all of that. I don’t know that I would say now is the time to do that.',\n",
       "   'CUTLER: What we currently do with primary care docs, is we say, “Every time you see the patient, send in a bill and we’ll pay you. Every time you have a phone call, send in a bill and we’ll pay you. Every time you do this, send in a bill and we’ll pay you.” ',\n",
       "   'A different payment model would be something like, “I’ll tell you what, we’re gonna pay you $40 for each person per month, adjusted for how severely ill they are. Then you figure out the best way to care for them. Oh, by the way, we’re going to monitor, like, make sure you actually do interact with them. They’re getting their medications, they’re self reports are good. And so on, so you can’t not see them. But you decide the best way to see them.” ',\n",

I don’t work for Cigna, or I don’t work for Oxford or United, or I don’t work for a commercial insurance company. Yet they put rules on me that may not actually be in the best interest of my patient.

So, I look at myself as somebody who is trying, to the best of my ability, to use my knowledge base and skills to navigate the health of the individual patient.

Because life is a game of incomplete information. You never know everything, and you are able to control a good amount of decisions leading up to the end because you can control how you present yourself. You can control whether or not you play. You can control how you play. But ultimately, you can’t control the cards. And I think that that’s a very good reflection of what goes on in life. There’s so much you can do, but then the ultimate outcome is not up to you. And you have to be okay with that. ',\n",

But honestly, being born and being born to my parents and having the genetic makeup that I have, I think, is the luckiest thing that happened. But that aside, I think the luckiest thing that ever happened was the fact that when I was 4 years old, my parents decided to leave the Soviet Union and come to the United States. My life would be so different had I grown up in the Soviet Union. I have no idea what would’ve happened or what I would’ve done. ',\n",

And you have to think what really changed the trajectory of your life in the most profound way? And honestly, being a Jew in the Soviet Union — this was before the Berlin Wall fell — was no fun.

But who knows what factors she’s using to make her decision? Maybe she has a premium hand. Maybe she has a mediocre hand but thinks she can outplay her opponent and so chooses to engage anyway. Maybe she has observed that the other player views her as conservative because she doesn’t play many hands, and she’s taking advantage of that image by opening up with worse cards than normal.

It’s just the best he can do given the information he has and his experience in this particular area. But will he tell the patient he’s unsure? Maybe.

So, if you have an internal locus of control, when good things happen, you take credit for them and you say, “Yeah, that was me.” And an external locus of control, you say, “Oh, no, no it was events in the world. I had nothing to do with it.” Most people, he found, have an internal locus when it comes to good things. They take credit for their success. But an external locus — they — switch when things go wrong. They say, “Oh, it wasn’t my fault. Here are all of the reasons why this went wrong.” But there are exceptions. There are people who have an external locus always. That’s not good at all. There are people who have an internal locus always. That’s also not good. And the normal signature is also not great, because if you always take credit for the good things and don’t take blame for the bad things, you’re going to be overconfident. So, you need to learn how to balance the two.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: It sounds, though, as if you’ve just drawn an unsolvable puzzle. You say both extremes are poor, but also the compromise or the moderate version is poor. So, how do you optimize external vs. internal? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think that the important thing is to have an internal locus most of the time in the sense that you understand that you do control a lot of things. But that also means keeping that internal locus for some of the bad events. But also, I think the way that you solve that puzzle is through decision-making and analysis. You actually learn that both modes of thought are possible. And so, before you jump to any conclusions, you break it apart and you say, “Okay, what was my decision process? What did I control here? What didn’t I? What was the outcome? And am I responsible for that outcome or not?” Because sometimes it will be something else and sometimes it will be you. ',\n",

People share things with you: if you’ve lost your job, your social network thinks of you when new jobs come up; if you’re recently divorced or separated or bereaved, and someone single who may be a good match pops up, you’re top of mind. That attitude is what I think of as a luck amplifier. Sure, you can’t actually change the cards, and the variance will be what it will be — but you will feel a whole lot happier and better adjusted while you take life’s blows, and your ready mindset will prepare you for the change in variance that will come at some point, even if that point is far in the future.

And roulette is boring because it can’t be solved. It’s all chance. The house wins. You know, there’s nothing you can do. ',\n",

And yet, it’s not solved in the sense that there are these elements of the unknown, this human element of bluffing, of representing and misrepresenting information. This is what decision-making in the real world is actually about. That was the germ of game theory. He came up with game theory as a way to try to solve poker and then ultimately shed a light onto how to make these very complex strategic decisions at the highest levels of government.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: You write about Von Neumann, he was a God-awful player by every account — poker player.

       "   'Poker isn’t a homogeneous game; there are multiple varieties of play, with names like Stud, Omaha, Razz, Badugi, and HORSE. Each has its own unique set of rules, but in any style of poker, the basic parameters are essentially the same: Some cards are dealt face-up, visible to all — these are the community cards — and some face-down, so that only the person to whom they are dealt can see them. You make bets based on how strong your hand is and how strong you think others’ hands are. Because the only other cards you know for sure are your own, you are in a game of incomplete information: You must make the best decision you can, given the little you know. ',\n",

How No-Limit Hold’em differs from other forms of poker is twofold. The first is in the precise amount of information that is held in common vs. in private. Each player is dealt two cards face-down: the hole cards. This is privileged information. I can try to guess what you have based on how you act, but I can’t know for sure. The only information I’ll have is your betting patterns once the public information — the cards dealt to the middle of the table, face-up — is known. ',\n",

       "   'The second thing that distinguishes this particular playing style is the concept of no-limit — Von Neumann’s own preferred style. “The power of the pure bluff is restricted in a game of limit,” explains Amarillo Slim, one of the best poker players of his day. When there’s a limit, it means that the exact amount you bet has a ceiling on it. In no-limit, you can bet everything you have, at any point. ',\n",
       "   'And that’s what makes this game a particularly strong metaphor for our daily decision-making. Because in life, there is never a limit. What’s to stop you from risking all your money, your reputation, your heart, even your life at any point you choose? Nothing. There are no rules at the end of the day, save some internal calculus that only you are privy to. And everyone around you has to know that when they make their decisions: Knowing you can go all the way, how much should they themselves invest? It’s the endless game of brinkmanship, popularized by another giant of game theory, the Nobel‐winning economist Thomas Schelling, that plays out everywhere in our lives. Who will say “I love you” first, moving “all in” in the relationship — and if you say it, will you be left out, so to speak? Who will walk away from the business negotiation? Who will wage war? The ability to go all in — and the knowledge that going all in is an option for everyone around us — is the crucial variable that makes so many decisions so very difficult.',\n",

You don’t necessarily like everyone as much as you tell them you like them.

You are just choosing what and how to present, what and how to present about your hand, about yourself. ',\n",

It seems to perhaps imply that many of us underestimate our strength in real life, I mean.',\n",

First of all, it shows just how much of a skill game poker is, because you are convincing people that you have the best hand when you don’t. And it does make you realize that in real life, it’s not the people who hold the best cards. It’s the people who convince everyone else, who are the most confident. To me, it’s a little bit dispiriting because it’s very hard for me to be that way in real life. It’s very hard for me to be the person who oversells my hand because one of the things I studied in grad school was overconfidence.

       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think it’s both. I definitely think it’s gender-driven. And I actually came to realize that as I immersed myself in the poker world, because I never thought of myself as someone who internalized gender stereotypes because I studied psychology. I knew what they were. And I thought that I was above all of that. And then poker made me realize how much I had and how often I acted because I’d been socialized to act in that way. ',\n",

And the fact that I came to this country and was a total outsider, that I didn’t speak English, that we didn’t have any money. I wore hand-me-down clothes and not the cool-kid clothes. All of those things probably stayed with me on some level and made me feel a little bit more self-conscious.',\n",

       "   'KONNIKOVA: When you’re female, you try not to step on people’s toes. You try to be affable. You try to be nice. You try to not be confrontational. And it’s very adaptive, because if you’re confrontational, if you actually push back it’s not going to go well, because all of the research on the psychology of negotiation and negotiating while female shows you that women are judged on very different criteria from men, and that women who negotiate more are not only not liked as well, but they’re not going to get what they negotiate for.

I mean, it’s just something that our brains do intuitively. The first thing people notice about me is that I’m a woman because that’s what stands out at a poker table. And so they react not to me as a player, but to me as a female first of all. The best players will adjust eventually, but especially at the levels where I started out, these weren’t the best players.

I remember one experience where I was playing against this guy and he just kept betting and betting. And finally, I folded. And he placed his cards face-up and said, “See, I had you beat. I had the best hand.” And that was one of these moments of realization of — “Oh well, thank you so much. Thank you, sir. I appreciate the information.” Because in anything, information is power.',\n",

       "   'KONNIKOVA: Exactly. He wanted me to know that he was trying to be a gentleman. And he actually said, “I didn’t want to take any more of your chips.” You know, they’re very chivalrous. They don’t want to be perceived as kind of bullying a woman. So, you adjust to that. Whenever they bet big, you fold. You fold very good hands. ',\n",
       "   'Then you have the people who just — they don’t think you should be at the poker table at all. And they’re gonna do a few different things. When they bet big, you have to call and you have to find it in yourself to keep calling, because they’re going to try to bluff you over and over and over. Because they don’t think you should be there, so they’re going to bully you. So, once you figure out how do you see women? What’s your perception? And how do you want to kind of play against me because you’re playing against a woman? Then, all of a sudden, I have this very powerful arsenal of new weapons and new ways to play against you.',\n",
       "   'There’s a false sense of security in passivity. You think that you can’t get into too much trouble — but really, every passive decision leads to a slow but steady loss of chips. And chances are, if I’m choosing those lines at the table, there are deeper issues at play. Who knows how many proverbial chips a default passivity has cost me throughout my life. How many times I’ve walked away from situations because of someone else’s show of strength, when I really shouldn’t have. How many times I’ve passively stayed in a situation, eventually letting it get the better of me, instead of actively taking control and turning things around. Hanging back only seems like an easy solution. In truth, it can be the seed of far bigger problems. ',\n",
       "   'I know all this, but I had somehow thought that my training in psychology, my knowledge of these biases, the fact that I’ve achieved some form of professional success in my life, meant that I had overcome my socialization. But what poker is showing me, now that I take a moment to really look, is how far that is from the truth. It isn’t that I’m incapable of learning an aggressive approach or understanding its merits. It’s that I have learned and understood, and want to make it work — but can’t because of the emotional baggage that has accumulated, without my awareness, throughout my entire professional life. I’m not a blank slate after all. It isn’t a pleasant realization, but it is an important one. Now that I see it, perhaps I can start working through it.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, one would think that even a poker novice — having a Ph.D. in psychology, one would think that that would prove incredibly useful in reading other players. Did it?',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: It did. It did, but not necessarily in the way that I thought it would. I thought that I would actually have some better abilities at tells, at reading players and figuring out what’s going on. It ends up that I didn’t, especially at the beginning, that I would fall for actually a lot of the biases that I’d studied, that I would make assumptions about players in the same way that they were making assumptions about me, only I didn’t quite realize just how wrong my assumptions were. ',\n",
       "   'But where it did help eventually is in kind of a metacognitive awareness that helped me identify those mistakes and fix them. Because I had the vocabulary. I realized that I was focusing on the wrong things. I was focusing on what people looked like, things like that how they acted. And what I should have been focused on — which is quite funny, because it was most of what Walter Mischel’s work had been for the last 20 years \\xad— was on situational dynamics. What’s going on at this table? How are these people relating to each other? How are they reacting? How do they act under these different situations? Once I realized that that was the most important thing, then my reading abilities improved, and I was actually able to use my psychology background.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But there have been poker players who really dismiss the people-reading part of it and the social-dynamic part of it and just are quants, just play the probabilities and succeed. So, what’s to say that you’re not overvaluing that part?',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: Nothing. And I think that they would probably say that I am overvaluing it. I think that you play to your strengths. The quant side is not my strength. I’ve mastered it to the point that I don’t make horrible mistakes of addition and subtraction when I’m calculating pot odds, but that’s about it. I think the way that you become a great player is to figure out what works for you. What Erik taught me is that there’s almost never a right way to do something, a right way to play in a certain situation. There is a right way to think about it. ',\n",

That does not count travel. That does not count all of those expenses. So, this is over my entire time. This is over three years. When I first started playing, I was losing money and I was writing it off as kind of an expense for the book. This was experience. This was the cost of doing it. And then in 2018, when I won over $200,000, what I really took home was much less because I’d been traveling all over the world. I had played a lot of tournaments in which I hadn’t cashed. So, I made much less than that. Maybe somewhere like $50,000, which is still very good. It’s still an up year. ',\n",

But there was one thing that just kept nagging at me, which is how much does poker really relate to real life? And the more I read, the more I’d come to think the answer was not really that much, that most interactions we have with people, either individually or in groups or society, that it doesn’t really translate so much. But you were arguing that it really does. ',\n",

       "   'KONNIKOVA: So, Nassim Taleb coined this phrase, “The Ludic Fallacy,',\n",
       "   ' which basically just tears apart the whole premise of my book. He says that you can’t use games as a metaphor for life because games are neat, and life is messy. And I actually wholeheartedly agree with the fact that life is messy, and games are not. And I think that that actually makes them much more powerful as teaching tools. We don’t learn well in life because it’s a noisy environment, because you can’t figure out what’s going on, because there are too many variables. It’s too uncontrollable. What poker does is remove some of that noise. Yes, in an artificial way, but in a way that actually allows you to access your thought process on a much deeper level. And then you can go to that noisy arena of life and learn to deal with it better. ',\n",
       "   'Yes, poker doesn’t have as terrible outcomes. Even no-limit Hold ’em, where you can wager it all — all you’re going to lose are your chips or however much money is on the table. In life, you can lose everything. But poker, in teaching you how to deal with those losses, on a game level, it then translates to a life level where all of a sudden you have the skills. You have the skills of emotional resilience. You have the skills of self-analysis to be able to get through those moments where life gets you down much more than poker ever could. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Can you give me an example of a good decision you’ve made in real life recently that you feel was directly influenced by your poker training?',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think that I’ve started approaching relationships in a very different way. One of the things that poker really brings home is the ',\n",
       "   'sunk-cost fallacy,',\n",
       "   ' which is something that plagues us a lot in our decision process, which is — basically we look at things that we’ve already invested and rather than say, “I can’t change it. That’s the past. I need to move on and make the best decision I can knowing what I know now,” we actually don’t do that. And instead, we say, ',\n",

       "   'Well, I’ve already spent so much time on this, I might as well finish it.” Instead, we’d be much better suited to say, “Hey, you know, that was time I can’t get back. But what I can control is the time I spend now. So, why don’t I actually use it in a more productive and a better way?” Poker has actually forced me to confront that head-on in my own life. And over the last few years, I’ve cut so many toxic relationships from my life that I realized had only been a part of my life because I’d invested so much time and energy into them — friendships that I’ve had for a very, very long time that I realized weren’t friendships, that were draining me more than anything else.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: All right. Let me ask you the last question. So, you’ve gone to a lot of trouble in your life. I mean, I shouldn’t say trouble. You’ve enjoyed it and done well with it, but you’ve gotten a Ph.D. in psychology, then you immersed yourself in a very serious study of poker and traveled around the world to play and get better and ultimately become good and win and so on.

You know, I did this so that you don’t have to. All it comes down to ultimately is something that you can, I think, get without reading my book, which is learn to see yourself from an external perspective.

And that’s going to take time. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: So, we don’t have quarterly data for the Great Depression. But the numbers for the first few years of the 1930s was real G.D.P. fell at about 10 percent a year. And from the peak to the trough of the Great Depression, real G.D.P. declined by about 30 percent. So, we ',\n",
       "   '. And when the numbers come out for the second quarter of this year, we’re likely to learn that it’s fallen by about 40 percent at an annual rate. ',\n",
       "   'So, when we talk about a 40 percent annual rate, it means, if we had the same behavior in the second quarter and in the next three quarters, G.D.P. would be down 40 percent. And nobody expects that to happen. I was just looking at some numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, and they think when the dust is all settled, we’ll probably say that G.D.P. fell about ',\n",
       "   ' over all of 2020. ',\n",
       "   'So, again, that’s horrible. But when you compare it back to the Great Depression, where it was 10 percent a year, and where it didn’t happen just one year but three years, it does at least help you to realize what our grandparents lived through back in the 1930s dwarfs even what is truly a horrible time now. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The first thing to say is, we still had a quite severe recession. And so in that sense, nobody should take a victory lap because it was really painful for lots of people. I think the one piece of the Recovery Act that has been now studied in hindsight is the aid to state and local governments. For an economist, it’s a great example, because some of the state and local fiscal relief in the Recovery Act was actually given more based just on historical accident. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: And so it gave us a nice natural experiment. We can see if states that got more fiscal relief for relatively exogenous reasons did better. And the answer was, they did. It was only about $130, $140 billion — I know, “only” — but it seemed to have been very effective. ',\n",

       "   'states and municipalities',\n",
       "   'were slower to recover',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Absolutely. Before Roosevelt came in, the states were the main ones doing relief and then as soon as Roosevelt started to have some of his public works and things like that, one of things we see is states saying, “Oh, thank heavens, now we can get our fiscal house in order.” As we were designing the Recovery Act, I was one of the big proponents of, “We’ve got to make sure that state and local governments don’t start laying off public workers and cutting a lot of the crucial services, because that’s just going to make this so much worse.” ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: State governments are something like ',\n",

       "   'ROMER: That’s a great question. I think the much better thing is probably for states to stay the way they are, and for the federal government to use its power to borrow to help the states. Simply because we are one country, and especially something like Covid doesn’t affect every place the same. But it seems like the natural thing that we all share in those burdens. You don’t say, “Oh, well, you’re a state that happened to get unlucky, so you’re just going to have to pay for it, right?” A benefit of being in a large country is that we have insurance. We take care of one another — when there’s a hurricane in Florida, the rest of the country helps them. When there is a terrible Covid outbreak in New York City, I think the rest of the country should help them.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. But the fact is that a lot of these states that are in real trouble, they claim that they’re not getting anywhere near the federal money that they need. So, relying on the old model may be catastrophic. What do you think will happen there? And let me include the question that’s a matter of some discussion and controversy, about bankruptcy for states, and whether it should perhaps be permitted. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Just as I think it’s a terrible thing for anyone to talk about the federal government defaulting on its debt — I think we’re a country where we pay our debt. So, I think letting states go bankrupt, that’s just not a sensible strategy. We ought to actually deal with the problems that we have. We’re a rich country. We can do this. And we don’t have to act like a country that doesn’t have effective government. ',\n",
       "   'What should be happening to a state that is in real trouble? I think it would certainly be much better for them to find a way to borrow than to not serve their people, to not deal with the public-health crisis. So, I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope that we can have sensible federal fiscal policy to help the states that are in real trouble. But barring that, finding a way to allow them to borrow, I think, would be a much better strategy. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I still feel we should have done even more. But I do feel good that I bargained people up by several hundred billion. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, talk about that for a minute. We’ve read about your participation as a member of this team — which included, among others, Larry Summers, who’s, I think, sometimes misunderstood in whether his aggression is intellectual or personal or whatnot. But you wanted the aid to be how much bigger than it ended up being, and how much more did you get than was originally proposed?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The main thing that I remember actually was a meeting where Larry turned out to be a crucial second vote for my opinion. So, I think the proposals had been for numbers closer to doing a fiscal stimulus of about $600 billion. And I remember having run lots of numbers. I came in and I said, “This is much too small. I think it needs to be, at least $800 billion and probably bigger.” And I almost fell off my seat when Larry said, “I agree with Christy.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Why were you so surprised he agreed?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Well, because Larry doesn’t agree with anyone. But so, it was really important for, as I said, it’s not nearly as big as it needed to be, but it was a lot bigger than anyone had been thinking. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Now, was your desire to have the fiscal stimulus be larger then, was that a result of your understanding of the Great Depression and the way that fiscal aid was used back then, and that it essentially was not large enough? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Absolutely. There are two things that I think I learned from the Depression. One was, relative to the size of the unemployment problem in the early 1930s, what Roosevelt did was much too small. It was big relative to anything that been done in the past. But it was not nearly enough to deal with the problem. I think the other thing is, actually, monetary policy can be very effective even when interest rates are quite low. And so, though what the Federal Reserve was doing wasn’t the bailiwick of the administration, one of the things that several of us tried to convey to the president is, what the Fed is doing is a great thing. You want to be supporting ',\n",
       "   '. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: What specifically was Bernanke doing that you thought was positive that needed encouragement? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Things like — when interest rates get to zero, one of the tools that you still have is to try to affect people’s expectations of inflation, because that affects what the real cost of borrowing is. And so, I think Bernanke was taking a number of steps. For example, at this time, they started giving out something that’s close to a target for what they were aiming for, for the inflation rate. ',\n",
       "   'And I remember trying to explain that that was probably a good thing, because we were in a world where with unemployment at 10 percent, people might be starting to expect inflation to come down. And if the Fed is signaling, “No, we’re going to keep it at least at 2 percent,” that can actually be very positive. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, the political costs of the recession, and your — the Obama White House’s — response to it were pretty extreme, whether it was the recovery plan itself or just the depth of the recession. The Dems got crushed in those midterms two years after Obama’s election. Surely the Trump administration is looking back at that to judge how they want their responses to affect the next election. How do you think that will influence what they ultimately decide? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I mean, I pray it doesn’t affect what they decide. What everybody should be doing is, what’s right for the country. And so this is a case where you would think that both their political interest and what the country needs would be, “Let’s deal with the public-health crisis. Let’s make sure there is enough support for workers, that there’s support for state and local governments.” So, I’m hoping that this is a time when there’s no conflict between the politics and what would be right to do. We’ll have to see. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Traditionally, the American economy has been — how I do want to say — more vibrant, more dynamic. So, if you want to compare us to Europe, we have more flexible labor markets, it’s easier to start a business here. It’s easier to close down a business here. And that has often served us very well, because capitalism is good at some things, and especially at figuring out what consumers want. But it does mean that it makes an economy much harder on workers — it’s a lot easier to lay people off, you don’t have the same employment protections. ',\n",
       "   'It certainly has been very hard on workers in this downturn compared, say, to a lot of European countries where the governments have just been paying employers to keep people on the books. ',\n",
       "   'So, one thing I could imagine is, we’ve discussed that some industries may never come back. Brick-and-mortar retail, it may come back some, but it’ll never be like it was. And I think the positive would be that the U.S. economy may be better at adjusting to such changes. ',\n",
       "   'That we are a dynamic economy. And so when there’s an opportunity, American firms are pretty quick to step in. But if you’re going to be a dynamic economy, you also need to think about, “How do you protect the people that may be harmed by all of that dynamism and don’t move as easily from one industry to another.” And we have to have a way to protect them and make sure that they’re able to keep body and soul together and retrain for whatever new jobs are coming down the line.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: There are a couple. We had the Making Work Pay tax credit. We thought, rather than write people checks and have them arrive in their mailbox or in their account, we would just slip it in. So, it’s just going to show up in lower withholding. And we thought people would just notice they had more money in their bank account and maybe that would have a good effect on spending. ',\n",
       "   'As it turned out, most people didn’t seem to even know they got it. Or worse yet, they thought the Obama administration had raised their taxes, which they hadn’t. We’d cut them by a lot. So, that was one that just didn’t work as we’d anticipated. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And was that a communication failure? A perception failure? How did that happen? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think some of it was a communication failure. I think some of it — it turns out economic theory doesn’t give us good insight. It’s really, in some sense, a behavioral question. Do people respond more if they see the check in their hands or do they respond more if it just shows up in their paycheck a little bit every month? And I think it was partly, we’re just learning.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: We were trying a lot, especially in 2010, to think of another fiscal stimulus that maybe would not be terribly expensive, but could have a big bang for the buck. So, we were very interested in a new hiring-tax credit, a way to convince businesses to hire workers. And, we really did due diligence on this one. We ran surveys and we spun the C.P.S. tapes.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Just all of research we could think of, we were just desperate to get them over the hump and ready to hire again. We ended up getting a small pilot program through Congress, but nothing on a big scale. So, I’m not sure that we ever learned whether this wouldn’t work. But that was a policy that I was very excited about. Maybe that’s still something we could have in our arsenal and try at some point. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Because, what Roosevelt was able to do, of putting just millions of people directly on the government payroll, I think, was incredibly valuable. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: This is the W.P.A.—',\n",
       "   'ROMER: W.P.A., the Civilian Conservation Corps. But in a modern world, trying to figure out how to hire millions of people quickly is something that seems really hard. And I think it’s something President Obama would have liked to do. And we thought about it. We tried. I remember having a conversation with some other cabinet secretaries. I’d say, “If money was no object, how many people could you hire?” They’d say, “Oh, lots. You know, 20- 30,000.” Like, that’s not going to do much when we’ve got millions and millions of people unemployed. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Why is it so hard? I mean, I realize you’re talking about the federal government hiring people vs. private firms, but you have been extolling the virtues of our nimble and robust capitalism, which can move fast, break things, hire and fire lots and lots of people. Why is it so hard for the federal government to do that? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think partly we have different standards for the federal government, so I think we try to do things probably more carefully. Think about the Civilian Conservation Corps. So, that’s the hiring program from the Depression that, built a lot of the buildings in our national parks and things like that. It hired mainly young men. It took them out into the woods to build roads and log cabins. ',\n",
       "   'And it sent three-quarters of their paychecks home to their mothers. And it was, by all accounts, incredibly successful. And, I’ve met with some of these people that were on C.C.C. projects. They’re now in their 80s and 90s, and it was life-transforming. But can you imagine proposing that today of, “Let’s hire young men, send them out to the woods and send their checks home to their parents?” That just, I think, is not in the modern American way of doing things. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. But there are certainly modern equivalents. For instance, one problem with disbursing aid money has been that it needs a lot of manpower. One problem with contact tracing is it needs a lot of manpower. So, is it really so hard to imagine the massive shift from private to public hiring over the next couple of years? Because this is not going to go away. ',\n",
       "   'Unemployment is not going, I assume, back to 3, 4, 5 percent anytime at all soon, right? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: No, I agree. And so contact tracing is a great example. That is something that we ought to be able to use lots of people and put them to use very, very fruitfully. I think even if you were to think about reasonable numbers, I suspect that you’re not going to be able to deal with the millions and millions of people that are currently unemployed. I’ll give you another example of — one of the ideas I was thinking about back in 2009 was, how about just a massive program of hiring people to be teachers’ aides? And I was really very taken with this, because so many of our public-works jobs tend to be for construction workers, male-, often, oriented jobs. ',\n",
       "   'And I thought this was a great way to make sure that we were getting some balance and something that might be particularly good for female employment in a tough time. And we ran into a certain amount of opposition from, you know, think about local school districts that are laying off teachers. And you say, “But I have this great program. I’m going to give you all these teachers’ aides.” They tended to say, “What we really need is the money so we can keep our teachers employed.” So, it is hard to figure out what’s the right way to do this. And I came away thinking, “Well, let’s give more money to state and local governments so they’re not laying off teachers and maybe they could hire the teachers’ aides.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay. So, if you are running some kind of economic SWAT team right now, let’s imagine you were running C.E.A. now or National Economic Council or something to the equivalent, and you were trying to game-plan the current recession or economic doldrums. Do you look more to the Great Recession as the model, whether because it’s more equivalent in some ways and/or just because it’s more recent? Or do you look more toward the Great Depression? Where are trying to draw your best inspiration from, both in terms of positive moves and mistakes to be avoided? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I almost think we need to not look at either of them. In both those episodes, or basically any other recession, the only problem is a lack of demand. And so, just any policy you take gets demand up. This is so different because it’s a public-health crisis. And you are not going to get demand up until you solve the public-health crisis, nor do you want to because you don’t want every business producing at full capacity, because then you have more workers than you can actually keep safe. ',\n",
       "   'I think we really need to throw away some of our previous experience and focus more on what’s unique about a pandemic and how do we actually deal with the public-health problem. I think I would go much less, let’s just get demand up, let’s just give people tax cuts. And much more, let’s spend so that we solve the public-health crisis. I’d maybe, take inspiration from other countries today that have made more progress than we have, rather than looking back at previous U.S. recessions. ',\n",
       "   'We talked earlier about, there is a dynamism to capitalism and especially a dynamism to the way Americans do things. But there is a cost, which is, because we’re laying off a lot of workers, the firm-employee link is being broken and they’re hard to get back. And it is hard to hire workers and get those right matches again. And so that’s going to be costly and that may tend to slow us down in the recovery process. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: There’s also the issue — I’ve heard this from several employers, mostly small- and medium-sized firms — that even if they survived Covid pretty well or are now returning to business, that they are having a really hard time rehiring their own former employees because the unemployment insurance and the other aid that people have been getting is really great and they can literally earn as much, if not more, by not going to work. I know this was an early concern when the CARES Act was being put together. It was largely dismissed as saying, “Hey, it’s much better to support individuals, if this is the downside, we’ll live with it.” But now, there are employers who are living with it. What are your thoughts on that? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think absolutely in the initial stages, it was great to get more money into the hands of people who were struggling, and we do as a country have a terrible inequality problem. So giving $600 more a week in benefits to a low-wage worker, that really was a great thing to do. I think as the economy recovers and you want people to go back to work, you don’t want them to just lose those funds to be worse off if they go back to work. ',\n",
       "   'So can you give some benefits — people have been talking about, re-employment bonuses or things like that. I think it also comes back to, we’ve got a long-run inequality problem. We should be dealing with that. At some point you don’t want to be doing it through your unemployment system. You want to be doing it in a more sensible way through your tax system or the earned-income tax credit or better benefits in the form of universal health insurance, things like that. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, one early and ',\n",
       "   ' was about fiscal policy. And you argued that fiscal policy during the Depression didn’t help the recovery all that much. And that finding of yours has been interpreted over the years as an argument against fiscal intervention — which, as I read your work, was not at all what you intended. So, can you just quickly summarize your actual finding and then describe the misinterpretation, then we’ll take it from there. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The actual finding is, if you look at what it was that helped the economy to recover from the Great Depression, the monetary actions that Roosevelt took when he came in were much more important. That didn’t have anything to do with whether fiscal policy could have been valuable. It was just the fact that we didn’t do all that much fiscal stimulus in the mid-1930s. And so it was not the main driver of the recovery. ',\n",
       "   'Much of my subsequent work — and all of it joint with my favorite co-author and also husband, David Romer — has actually been pointing out that fiscal policy is very effective. ',\n",
       "   'So, we have a paper looking at the effects of tax changes. And if you cut people’s taxes it does help to stimulate the economy in the short run. It helps you to increase demand and get an increase in output. We’ve looked at the effect of transfer payments, and that, too, has a substantial ',\n",
       "   '. I think we’ve done some very important work saying that fiscal policy is really valuable. It just turned out it was not used in a nearly aggressive enough way in the Depression to have been a big factor accounting for that recovery. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Although Roosevelt must have felt that he was using a lot of fiscal stimulus, yes? It seemed like a lot at the time relative to what had been done in the past? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Oh, of course. Right. And it was even a lot in an absolute amount in the sense that the actions taken by the federal government were pretty substantial. But if you look at the total fiscal situation for the U.S., because state and local governments were going in the opposite direction of hunkering down, of actually raising taxes, cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus was pretty small because the states counteracted anything Roosevelt was doing on the positive side. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: We should also say — this is tangential, but I can’t let it pass without saying — that among your husband’s most noteworthy research has to do not with depressions, recessions, but with ',\n",
       "   '. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: True. He calls that one his midlife-crisis paper. Even he would tell you, his most important work is on monetary and fiscal policy and financial crises. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But I gather that Bill Belichick read the paper and integrated it into his philosophy, yes? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I believe he did read the paper. But you’d have to talk to David about whether he listened to it enough. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Obviously it is tangential to our conversation, and yet in some way it’s not — which is that it was an empirical finding which argued that using the tools of economic analysis, you can determine that almost all football coaches are playing fourth-down wrong and that they should punt much less than they do. And yet it’s been mostly ignored by all but maybe a handful of coaches. Do you see equivalent empirical research done in the realm of fiscal or monetary policy that is demonstrably correct or at least worth considering among the tribe of economists, but is largely ignored by practitioners?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: One of the things that’s been nice is that in a lot of macro research, it actually has been the opposite of ignored, that policymakers have listened. So, I think especially central bankers have been very interested in academic research on the effectiveness of quantitative easing or the impact of monetary policy or credit, things like that. So, I think on the monetary side, there is a lot of interest in research and learning from the research. On the fiscal side, it’s been a mixed bag. I feel there’s a lot of professional research that fiscal policy can be very effective. ',\n",
       "   'When I was in the Obama administration, certainly later in the Obama administration, when he desperately needed more fiscal stimulus, that was the moment when policymakers, especially Republican policymakers, decided that, “No, fiscal policy didn’t do anything.” But then part of what’s happened over the last 10 years is there’s just been paper after paper looking at what was done in the Recovery Act, ',\n",
       "   ' across countries in terms of their ',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: I have to say, when I first started paying attention to economics years ago, it was one of the things that most dispirited me, because I found that the greatest economists of the era were still debating the degree to which fiscal policy during the Depression either helped end the Depression or, on the other hand, exacerbated it.',\n",
       "   ' And I thought, “Well, wait, if these people can’t tell us the answer to that question perhaps you’re not very useful to us.” I don’t mean to indict your whole tribe, but you’re saying that you feel there has been more consensus, at least on that kind of macro policy intervention in the last 10 or so years, yeah?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I do. I think if you look, say, at the University of Chicago’s — their panel of experts, if you say, “What did the Recovery Act do?” Some very large fraction will say, “It ',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: We should say that’s a survey that U of C runs. It’s not all University of Chicago economists. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: No, no, no. It’s actually a very wide range of economists. So, I think everyone wants to say, “Oh, economists all disagree.” I think you can always find somebody to take the other side. But it’s often the case that 90 percent of economists believe one thing and 10 percent believe the other. And so the vast majority would say monetary policy is very important. Vast majority would say if you cut people’s taxes, that will indeed stimulate the economy in the short run. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, so let’s, in our remaining time, look at the future as best we can. It’s obviously unpredictable. I’m curious, when you look at the policy that you see being considered and being made now, fiscal and monetary policy, and if you try to play it out in your mind — not just a few months from now, but a few years, maybe many years from now — I’m especially curious if you think there are any lessons from the Depression in particular that we should be taking, especially when the cure turns out to be as dangerous as the ailment itself. ',\n",
       "   'So, one example I think about — this is not a perfect parallel — but after the war, when there were wage controls, and health insurance began to be offered as a fringe benefit and bundled with employment, which is something that most health economists say is one of the really difficult things about our health care system now. When you look at the policies being considered or made now, what you think we should watch out for, what might be some sad or difficult downstream effects? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The one that worries me is the budget deficit. So, not in the immediate term, but if you think about how much money we’re spending, it’s completely appropriate. We need to be doing it. But we are better at running budget deficits now than we are at dealing with them when the crisis has passed. And so if we keep dealing with crises but then not getting our fiscal house in order afterwards, at some point, we’re not even going to be able to deal with the crises, because we will have run our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio up so high. ',\n",
       "   'We should have a plan to raise taxes eventually to get back in a more sustainable system. I think the pandemic may well exacerbate inequality. And that was already a terrible problem.

       "   'DUBNER: I do feel compelled to point out that it’s a little disorienting to speak to you, a Democratic or Democratic-associated, at least, economist, who is urging against a certain level of deficit spending because we’re used to Republicans saying that. Especially recently, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he pledged to use what he called the Fed’s “full range of tools” to support the economy. ',\n",
       "   'And he also urged policymakers to not worry so much about raising debt and instead to use what he called the “great fiscal power of the United States” to get through this with “as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible.” So, is this just a matter of the Republicans are in office now and you respond to the crisis in front of you? Or has there been some kind of switching of direction for Democrats and Republicans, or economists who support them, when it comes to deficit spending? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I want to be clear. I am wildly in favor of doing the deficit spending that we’re doing now. We need to do this. I agree completely with Chair Powell that we should be doing anything we need to do to get the economy through this crisis. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t think about the deficit. Even in 2010, we’re not about to try to deal with the deficit right then. ',\n",
       "   'But we were talking about it. Because you need a plan for three years, five years from now, how do we deal with this? And perhaps because I believe so firmly that fiscal stimulus is a crucially valuable tool, I want to make sure it’s there the next time we face something like this. And so I think I’ve been very aware of the need to, when you make it through a hard time and you’re back in the good times, that’s when you repair the roof on your house. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. So, are we all going to come out of this okay, do you think?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I hope so. I mean, there are going to be some workers whose jobs disappear forever. We’re not just going to go back to the way we were. So I think we could all come out of this okay, provided we take the policy actions that we need. We invest in the training to make sure everybody’s okay. I worry that we’ll get through the worst of it and then we’ll forget about some of the people that have been hurt and that remain struggling. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And let’s say that some of the changes that have happened thus far to travel, to live entertainment, to restaurants — basically all of them wiped down close to zero — let’s say that for a variety of reasons, they sort of stick, and that people don’t return to them, in in large numbers at least. Do you feel that the U.S. economy and our brand of capitalism is still set up to be as vibrant and nimble to adjust and for people to job-reallocate? Or do you worry that a lot of people in those industries, which employ millions of people, that they will essentially be adrift, perhaps for a long time, unable to reallocate into commensurate jobs? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think many of them will be able to reallocate. Again, I have a lot of faith in workers and in their ability to develop new skills and find jobs when they’re available. I think they’ll need a helping hand. They’ll need support in the period in which they are trying to learn a new skill. It also is going to be a lot easier for a 25- or a 30-year-old worker than it’s going to be for a 55- or a 60-year-old worker. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I sometimes think that this moment is, that if you were looking at this from the future, like an archeologist looking at sediment, like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, ultimately, that this is going to have a huge scarring effect on the world. And maybe I’m totally wrong. But my sense is that this disruption has already led just about everybody to question the way they live their life, the way they earn their living, the way they interact with their families, the rest of society, community, and so on. When you look down the road, do you think the world is fundamentally different? And if so, on what levels? Or do you think I’m maybe being way melodramatic here? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I’m perhaps not quite as dramatic as you, but I agree that this may set off a sea change. I think you’re right that we will probably trade less, travel less, work differently. Whether it is a giant shift or just a moderate shift, I’m less sure, but I think it is going to change things. And I think the real question is how well we manage this. ',\n",

       "   'Stephen DUBNER: Who were their opponents at this time? Was it other women’s teams, was it men’s teams, were the other teams from other factories? Were they semi-professional? ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: All of the above. They would play exhibition games. They started playing against foreign national teams. Women were playing other sports like tennis and golf and so on. And so this was a point when the sport might really have taken off and women’s soccer become a sport in its own right. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: The Football Association is the governing body of soccer in England, and it was founded in 1863. So, it’s important to state that already the F.A. was discouraging women’s soccer — so back as far as 1902, they’d suggested that their affiliated organizations ought not to permit games against lady teams.',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: The owners of the men’s professional teams complained about the game at Everton because they saw it as a threat. If women’s soccer became popular and could attract those kinds of gates, that would take away from the men’s professional team. ',\n",
       "   'They persuaded the F.A. to pass a resolution, and the resolution read as follows: “Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the council feels impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. For these reasons, the council requests the clubs belonging to the association to refuse the use of their grounds for such matches.” And that was the ban. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: Because women couldn’t play, and not only women couldn’t play — girls couldn’t play at school. There were no girls’ teams in schools. Because all the schools are affiliated to the Football Association as well. So really, this ban rooted out the possibility of women’s soccer in England and in other countries for more than half a century. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: FIFA is a famously corrupt organization. ',\n",

       "   'SZYMANSKI: But it was ultimately supported by FIFA. So, the most important thing to understand about women’s soccer is that FIFA banned it until 1971. So essentially, any organization that was associated with FIFA — if it allowed women to use their facilities — then they would be excluded from FIFA. Ladies’ soccer died out completely. For half a century, there’s little or no evidence of it being played. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: I think if they hadn’t been banned, women’s soccer today would be like women’s tennis. There would be organized leagues playing commercially and it would be a global phenomenon. ',\n",

And the women claiming they were being paid less for equivalent work than the men. The main issue really is the recognition of the superior level of performance of the U.S. women compared to the U.S. men.',\n",

       "   'SZYMANSKI: FIFA allocated $440 million as prize money to be shared amongst the competing teams for the men’s World Cup. But only $30 million for the women. So, in terms of the U.S. national teams, for example, in terms of reaching the quarterfinal, which the U.S. men don’t, and which the U.S. women always do, getting to the quarterfinals for last World Cup would have been worth over $550,000 to the men, but only $90,000 to the women. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, so the total revenue pool, $440 million for the men’s, that’s all countries in the men’s World Cup finals versus $30 million. Those numbers are derived from what? In other words, does the men’s World Cup earn something like 14, 15 times what the women’s does? ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: Well, one of the problems with evaluating parity between men and women is: FIFA doesn’t even really offer very clear data on how much money the Women’s World Cup generates. We know the men’s World Cup generates about $6 billion. And the Women’s World Cup presumably generates significantly less than that. However, many people have observed that this is partly a failing of promotion on the part of FIFA.',\n",

       "   'SZYMANSKI: They can’t organize themselves. They can’t create a following. They can attract investors. They can’t do anything that a commercial business might do in order to grow something for which there is a demand. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, Stefan, you’re an economist and you guys are always teaching us that competition is what makes markets thrive. But throughout history, we see that many firms who subscribe to economic theory when it’s good for them, when they see competition that they think is not good for them all of a sudden, they don’t want economics to work the way it’s supposed to work, or they don’t want the competition. I’m curious whether this resolution against women’s teams calls to mind any examples from history, other economic competition that was attempted to be shut down by some existing guild? ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: Well, to me, as an economist, this sounds like an antitrust case. Antitrust is a set of laws which specifically intended to prohibit businesses from stopping other businesses from competing against them. And these laws are enforced fairly rigorously. If they’d had an antitrust suit back in the 1920s and won it, then they could have stopped this dead in their tracks and history would have been different. But what people will say now is, “Well, who are we going to prosecute? How are we going to hold someone responsible?” And that’s obviously problematic. But on the other hand, if you have a clearly identified wrong, which has clear consequences, I think something should be done about it. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And what do you think should be done about it? ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: Well, I believe that the right answer here is reparations. I think women’s soccer can grow now, even with the handicap it had for half a century, into being a fully competitive, self-sustaining enterprise. But it needs a lot of support to make up for that 50 years of ban. And I think the soccer authorities that grew rich with men’s soccer should be diverting a significant amount of their resources into women’s soccer.',\n",

In my work, along with many others, we find that race, gender, immigrant status, group identity in general is not something on the periphery, but is a pillar, is a pivot to how we understand political economy. So, we take it head-on. We try to understand the ways in which hierarchies are created and maintained. ',\n",

But the reality was that I was not motivated to go to business or law school and that I became very fond of the academy. And also I began to fall in love with the approach that economists have to try and study subject matter. The idea of trying to maximize some objective function subject to constraints. So, it was a very structured approach to problem solving.',\n",

But wealth, wealth as a concept, wealth as an indicator, allows you to take risk. It funds and seeds any ingenuity you might have. And it also allows you to finance big-purchase items like an expensive education. It allows you to, if you’re confronted with the criminal-justice system, be able to hire the best counsel possible. ',\n",
       "   'It allows you, if you’re confronted with a medical issue and your insurance is not up to par, it allows you to be able to deal with that health issue without the risk of going bankrupt. Effort matters. Ingenuity matters. But effort and ingenuity is limited and frankly plays a miniscule role if you have no capital to begin with. The main determinant of wealth is wealth itself. The old adage that wealth begets more wealth, I think that’s accurate. ',\n",

       "   'BROWN: It is a fascinating question, because it’s not— it’s hard to answer right now before we just figure out what the new equilibrium is. We’re in the middle of the largest perturbation that has hit higher education in memory. The online M.B.A. was created with not Covid in mind. Now there is a cadre of people who would have normally gone to residential programs who are considering that option. I mean, it’s going to take data over time because we still have a large number of applications for our fall M.B.A. program. ',\n",

Because one of the things that’s key to all of this is — as a residential campus — housing. There’s an upper bound where I can make the guarantees I want to make the parents about the housing situation for their children. Now we’re lucky we’re in an urban area. That gives us a little bit of flexibility because there are other ways to house people. ',\n",

       "   'BROWN: Let me start with what I think is the biggest topic for universities in the fall, and that’s testing. Because the answers to these questions really depend on testing protocol.

       "   'BURWELL: I think my time at H.H.S. has been very specifically helpful in terms of understanding the basic framing of public health crises, that you approach this around the idea of prevention, detection, and response. American University was very early to send our students home. And a part of that was my understanding about the issues of density as well as what burden that would put on the D.C. healthcare system. The density that we have is like density of other places. We see that with nursing homes. We see that with cruise ships. When people are in shared spaces, this was a highly-transmissible disease.',\n",

       "   'BURWELL: So that is a part of what we’re working through. At American, we actually have three different task forces. Because the level of detail that one needs to consider these types of decisions is quite deep. And the task forces are focused on health and safety overall, in terms of how we will do things like testing, the contact tracing, the isolation, those types of issues. We’re focused on our workforce, because bringing the workforce back is an integral part, and related to our students and our faculty and research. And the third area is our student enrollment and students coming back. It’s a place that’s focused particularly on the students.',\n",

We still have 1,500 living in our residence halls because they have nowhere else to live. They live with us. Some schools asked them all to leave and we were like, “Well, where would they go?” So we’ve been taking care of them. ',\n",

I think people haven’t realized what this means, whether it’s in the beauty shop or in a classroom. When you have fewer people in something, either you’re going to do it for fewer people, or you’re going to do it more times.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: If I were to ask you to put one of your government hats back on for a moment, when you talk about the relatively large fraction of students who may not attend in the fall, that sounds like a problem, obviously — a lot of young people without something to do, and a lot of parents who probably are ready for those kids to go do something — but it also sounds like an opportunity. And I’m thinking about things like AmeriCorps and other projects. If you had free rein with some government post to look at that relatively large pool of bright, motivated young people, is there anything that comes to mind that you could do with them or help them do?',\n",

So thinking about the places where there will be unique demand and need is one thing that I think would be important to think about what young people can be doing. ',\n",

If I had perfect testing, what would perfect testing look like? That for every person on my campus, the second that they — or the minute, or the hour — they acquired Covid, an app on their phone told everybody around them they had it, including me. If I had that world, I wouldn’t need much social distancing. Because social distancing is basically the long-term public-health standard for lack of knowledge about who has the disease.',\n",

Let’s look for this and let’s particularly look for exceptions, because it will make a more interesting theory if we can say, ‘Well, bad things are stronger than good things in A, B, C, and D, but the exceptions are E, F, and G.’” The problem was we couldn’t find exceptions. All different methods and all different sorts of phenomena keep pointing to the same conclusion: the mind just overreacts to bad relative to good.',\n",

I think the general consensus is really having serious money problems where you just don’t have enough money — yeah, that’s a downer. It’s hard to be happy with that.

They generally were open to lower-income families and people in the beginning, but then if you did well, if you became middle-class or you became upper-class, you weren’t required to leave. And because they were really nice buildings and right in the middle of town, people stayed. So you end up with this wide range of people and incomes in the same building and all over town.

How do you have a date?” And trying to figure out human behavior, because it didn’t come naturally. ',\n",
       "   'Over the years, I realized that slowly that was fading away a little bit and there was like a self-therapy.

So I wanted to ask you about that, just your personal assessment of that. And I thought one way to think about it is: Talking Heads were generally a very well-reviewed band. I’m sure, however, there was the occasional bad review, whether it was a record or a live show. I’m curious how you assessed. Did you accentuate the negative? ',\n",
       "   'BYRNE: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It’s the bad ones that you’d remember. And— or there’d be a good review. And there’d be one negative sentence about my appearance, or my dancing, or something else, and that would be the thing that I would remember. ',\n",

We like that.” But I realized that long-range, if I keep doing that, I’m going to get bored and I’ll be left by the side of the road at some point. But if I keep evolving there might be some short-term resistance to that, but long-term, I think the reception will be better. ',\n",

       "   'DOLEAC: It is a research group that focuses on empirical research related to crime and discrimination. So we try to find answers to some of our trickier policy problems.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: I kind of assumed I would be an investment banker like every other econ major.',\n",

       "   ' article about D.N.A. databases and how the laws vary state to state in terms of which offenders are required to provide D.N.A. to our criminal-justice D.N.A. databases. And I thought, that’s a great natural experiment.',\n",

       "   ' showed that dramatically reduced recidivism for people in the U.S.',\n",
       "   'Stephen DUBNER: Meaning because it acted as a disincentive to commit further crimes because of the knowledge that your likelihood of being caught is higher?',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Exactly. So increasing the probability of getting caught then has a deterrent effect on future crime. And then it just turns out, crime is really interesting.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Now, do you have a lot of personal experience with crime?',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Not yet. Maybe one day.',\n",
       "   ' 1.5 million people',\n",
       "   ' $100 a day',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: I think the biggest issue is the incredible inefficiency. So we lock a huge number of people up every year. We incarcerate them for a really long time. That has cost to them personally, likely has cost to the community. There are probably other, more cost-effective ways to reduce crime than just locking people up. Policing is another place where we have a bunch of research showing that hiring more police officers on average reduces crime. But we know remarkably little about what is valuable for police to actually spend their time on during the day, and what tips into what we would consider over-policing. And there are just a bunch of problems like that — the courts and re-entry and so on.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: This is probably my favorite thing about working in this space, is that I frequently wind up talking to people who are far more liberal and far more conservative than I am, at the same table. And everyone’s trying to work toward the same goal.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So you’ve got the libertarians, who look at our criminal-justice system as just another big failed government program and they want to shrink it. And then you have',\n",
       "   'the more religious right that believes strongly in redemption and second chances. And then you’ve got folks on the left who worry about our criminal-justice system and the racial disparities involved in it, and criminalizing poverty and so on.',\n",
       "   ' two-thirds of them will return',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: If you happen to be released at a time when the local labor market is really bad, like right now, we might expect recidivism rates overall to increase. We’re making it really hard for people to get back on their feet and build a stable life free of criminal activity. ',\n",
       "   ' getting a job',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So this is a much more complicated answer than you might expect. Part of the challenge in working in this space is how little we actually know about this population. So if you think about the Census and all of our other big national surveys, none of those surveys ask a question about whether you have a criminal record.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: That sounds terrible for you. ',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Yes. It is challenging.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Why do the kind of surveys that you mentioned not include questions about imprisonment? I would think the roots are anti-discriminatory, yes?',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: You worry that people wouldn’t answer truthfully or that they might be worried about the government coming after them if they say yes to that question.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: The argument that you hear sometimes is that people who’ve come out of prison and have had a hard time finding a job and really don’t want to go back, they make great employees because they will work really hard and they’ll be really loyal to you. So you do hear that from employers sometimes.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: The reasons that employers tend to give usually are along the lines of, they’re worried about the legal liability that comes with having someone on the job who might commit another crime. There are other potential things, like people coming out of prison on average are at higher risk for substance abuse and that sort of thing.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So traditionally there’s a box you check, you know, check this box if you have a criminal record or a felony conviction.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: “Ban the Box” is a policy that aims to help people with criminal records get their foot in the door with employers and get a job, and it works by prohibiting employers from asking job applicants if they have a criminal record until relatively late in the hiring process.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So you have some very left-leaning groups, coming at this from more social-justice reasons. And then you had the Koch brothers coming from a more libertarian perspective, and also the belief in redemption. They were really pushing for this policy as a way to ensure second chances for people who had paid their dues and served their time and now wanted to get a job.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: What winds up getting a lot of media attention is what happens in the federal government. And nothing gets done in the federal government.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Criminal-justice policy is almost entirely made at the state and local level.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: California and Massachusetts implemented “Ban the Box” policies. But you also have Nebraska that implemented “Ban the Box” policies. And you really do have a mix of places that are more coastal and more liberal, and places in the middle of the country that are not.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: If “Ban the Box” works really well, then we should see an increase in employment for the types of people that are more likely to have a recent criminal conviction that might worry an employer.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So if this policy is working, then we might expect employment to increase, particularly for young men of color who don’t have a college degree. That’s the group that is most likely to have a recent conviction.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: I remember thinking, well, that could totally backfire.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: If you remove information about who has a criminal record, which presumably employers are worried about, then they might try to guess who has a criminal record.',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: And then they might simply discriminate against the entire group that contains people who are more likely to have criminal records. ',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: So we found that, on average, across the U.S., in places that ban the box, employment fell by 5 percent for young black men who didn’t have a college degree and by 3 percent for young Hispanic men who didn’t have a college degree. And so the next question is, who are they hiring instead? And we found, on average, the people who benefited were older men of color. So if you’re trying to avoid people who are actively involved in crime, older people are a pretty good bet. Criminal activity tends to decline with age.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And what about young under-educated white potential employees?',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: For young white men who had the same level of education, we saw employment increase for that group. What seemed to be happening was that employers were substituting from young men of color to young white men. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: My sense is that you came into this like the person that’s watching a horror movie when the character’s going into the abandoned barn and you’re saying, “No, can’t you see what’s going to happen?” I mean, did it seem that obvious to you? ',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: It felt very obvious to me. If employers are statistically discriminating based on who is likely to have a record, which is our hypothesis going into the study, then that’s the same group that we might expect to see a reduction in employment for.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, so talk about the response to your paper. As word about the paper began to get out in policy circles, I’m sure that everyone said, “Oh my goodness, we’ve made a terrible mistake. This policy not only is not helping the people we wanted to help, but it’s actually hurting people who have nothing to do with this at all. Let’s roll back these policies immediately.” Is that what happened?',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Yes, exactly. “Ban the Box” has been repealed everywhere — no. Unfortunately, we got a lot of pushback. By the time we had enough years of data to actually test the hypotheses and put out studies that we’re really confident in, there was a really established “Ban the Box” lobby. And so at this point, there are organizations that are very wedded to not helping people with criminal records get employment, but passing “Ban the Box” laws. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And you’re the pesky economist that says, well, yeah, but you’re actually not getting a very good outcome. ',\n",
       "   'DOLEAC: Exactly. Right. The challenge is that most people who are on the ground working on the policy aren’t thinking necessarily about what’s next? How do people then respond to this new set of incentives? And that’s what economists are trained to think about.',\n",

Many of those people should have been counted among the unemployed, at least among the temporary unemployed.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: So the fastest data that comes out is applications for unemployment insurance. Those are called Unemployment Insurance initial claims data.

       "   'STEVENSON: There’s a third way that we can try to take a look at the state of the labor market. We can survey households and ask people what were you doing in a particular week? Were you at work or not? All these numbers are in this sort of 20 to 30 to 40 million. That’s a huge range. But it all paints the same picture of really a staggering scale of work stoppage.',\n",

       "   'WOZNIAK: And in this event, unemployment rates for Hispanic workers have shot past those for black and white workers and they are experiencing the highest levels of unemployment right now. So that is really something that’s quite different.',\n",
       "   'WOZNIAK: I think folks might have heard that popular phrase “the jobless recovery.” And what that was connecting to was an empirical fact that employment was somewhat slower to recover in the last couple of recessions prior to the Great Recession. And in fact, there’s good evidence that it never quite fully recovered, particularly for some skill groups of workers, that what we had in the more recent recessions was a significant reallocation of what jobs looked like so that when employment started to pick up coming out of the recession, the types of jobs that folks were doing looked a little bit different.',\n",
       "   'WOZNIAK: If you look at recessions in the 60s and 70s, you would see folks reporting layoffs — this very formal, “We’re laying you off, but we might call you back,” type of separation.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: What ultimately happens to job loss depends on the consumption choices that you and I and everyone else make during and in the wake of this pandemic.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: We are learning to use new technology and the pandemic has forced us to make some investments in change that we might not have made before, at least not right away, because change is hard. But with a pandemic, we’ve been forced to learn how to order things online, how to use Zoom, how to use Google Hangouts. So those investments will make us more likely to continue to use new technology going forward.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: We’re also adjusting to a new level of risk that may lead to changes in how we live our lives for a while and the things we want to consume. People who are avid travelers may not go back to traveling for quite some time. People who love to go out and hear music at concert halls or love to go out to dinner, they may not continue to do those things at the same level or same degree.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: In many states, including my state of Michigan, dentists were told they should not practice during this period of rising contagion. And this would be a very hazardous job if you were a dentist or a dental hygienist. Cleaning people’s teeth, being in their mouths, maybe they’re an asymptomatic Covid person. So there’s a risk to the workers. That’s going to change whether people want to go back to those jobs.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: We’re going to see lower household income. And when there’s lower household income, people buy less. Some households may not even find that their income has declined, but there may be concerns that their income will. That causes a lot of people to slam the brakes on their consumption.',\n",
       "   'STEVENSON: What we see is that people tend to buy fewer durable goods, like a deep freezer, when incomes decline. But people who are adjusting to a new level of risk seem to think that they’d like to be able to buy more of their groceries at once, be able to put more things in the freezer, be better prepared for not being able to get to the shops.',\n",

       "   'WOZNIAK: So, the way they come up with that estimate is that, again, from older recessions, when we had significant amounts of layoffs, it looked like about three-quarters of folks who were on layoff were eventually rehired. What we’re missing with that is some of these reallocation effects that happen in recessions.',\n",
       "   'WOZNIAK: Reallocation just means the economy was doing a certain set of jobs or tasks or making a certain set of things. And then they switched to making some different things, right? So, you can think of the 20th century as just one big exercise in reallocation. We went from lots of people producing agricultural goods to almost nobody producing those. And now we produce other things. But that happens on a bit more of a granular scale in recessions. It’s reallocation; it’s not just straight-up destruction. And that process will take time.',\n",
       "   'automatable',\n",
       "   'Daron ACEMOGLU: Automation is really one of the key technological aspects of the last several hundreds of years.',\n",
       "   ' ',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: If you think about what the British Industrial Revolution was, it was a slew of automation technologies that took the tasks that were previously performed by skilled artisans in textile and in other factories and found ways of automating them, mechanizing them.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: You know, it’s most classically summarized by our discussions of the Luddites — the revolters who broke textile machines because they were afraid of losing their jobs to the machines. And we always equated Luddites with irrationality or being anti-technology. But actually, when you look at the details, the Luddites weren’t exactly wrong. They understood that they were losing their jobs, and there’s a reason for it.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: If automation is bringing significant productivity gains and cost savings, then it will create disruption, but there will be other compensating changes that may undo some of that disruption. So people who lose their jobs in textile factories can get jobs in other factories or other sectors.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: But on the other hand, if automation is not very productive, then you get a double whammy. You get the disruption, but you don’t get any of the benefits. And especially marginal automation that takes place because of mistakes or because policy somehow encourages automation at the margin, would be of this sort, which Pascual Restrepo, my collaborator on much of this work, and I call “so-so” automation.',\n",
       "   ' reversed some of it',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: And then, if you look at the post-1980 period, a completely different picture. Productivity continues to increase, somewhat more anemically, somewhat less strongly than before. But labor demand, especially for workers without a college degree, is stagnant. And in fact, for high-school graduates is declining.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: In the U.S., we provide huge subsidies to firms to adopt equipment instead of hiring labor. So what that does is that it encourages a lot of so-so automation because a lot of technologies that you would not have adopted and you would have just employed workers, you now find it profitable to do so because it has tax advantages.',\n",
       "   ' greater degree',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: But in addition, we have also cut corporate taxes, both the actual rate, but also the effective rate because we’ve had an expansion in S-corporations that don’t pay the corporate income tax. And then finally we’ve cut the income tax rates of the capital owners, the top of the income tax. So all of these have contributed to reducing the effective tax on capital to essentially zero.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: So if you look at some of the automation technologies of the last several decades, they’re very, very promising. Industrial robotics, I think that’s one of the most important technological breakthroughs, and more recently, we have A.I. By its nature, A.I. is very rich. You can use artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, as a way of creating new tasks, new functions for humans. Think about teaching. You know, if you provide more input to teachers in real time about what are the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each student or groups of students, that can really transform the teaching profession. ',\n",
       "   'But instead, what is it that we do with A.I.? Well, with A.I. in the education domain, what we do is that we tried to replace the teachers — automated testing, multiple-choice questions that can be graded so that the teachers don’t have to interact with the students as much. I think the good type of automation, we’re all the beneficiaries of it. You know, robotics, it creates disruptions. But we don’t want to dial the time back and have workers assemble cars and be subject to work accidents and costs of production are much higher, so that encourages offshoring. So there are a lot that can do with the right automation technology. But the problem is that we do too much of that and we ignore the humans.',\n",
       "   'ACEMOGLU: Now, the current crisis actually heightens some of these trends. On the one hand, it is deepening our dependence on automation in a good way. I mean, in this time of lockdowns, if we did not have access to digital technologies, to A.I. technologies, to robotics, we would be in dire straits in terms of weathering the storm. ',\n",
       "   'But on the other hand, this could be an impetus to going to a future of just automation and nothing else, because it’s already the case that major companies in the U.S. are automating and are banking on automation. They’re becoming stronger out of this. We’re becoming more afraid of social interactions and all of the physical contact that are involved. And we’re making a lot more investments in automation at the moment. Now, what I’m worried about is that this will go more in the wrong direction.',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: Here’s my question for you today. It’s about happiness, which is an interesting and weirdly contentious subject, in a way. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Because people disagree about what makes happiness. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And you don’t think about happiness the way many people do. Many people think of happiness as goal No. 1 in life. And your father told you, hell no. I don’t care if you’re happy, be successful.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yeah, I mostly care about achievement as a psychologist, and as the daughter of my father. But I will tell you, I grew up in the',\n",
       "   '. That’s where I did my Ph.D. So, you can ask me a happiness question. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: All right. So, different disciplines look at happiness in different ways. Different disciplines call it different things. But happiness seems to be a word a lot of them have landed on.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: There’s really three aspects of happiness that are widely used. One is life satisfaction. And then the second is positive emotion, feeling energetic or joyful. Now I know those sound like the same thing, but life satisfaction is thinking that your life is good. ',\n",
       "   'Overall you would say, “Oh, I wouldn’t want to trade my life with another’s.” Whereas this positive emotion thing is quite literally feeling positively. And those aren’t exactly the same thing. But the third aspect of happiness is actually very different, and that is the absence of negative emotion — the absence of anxiety and depression, worry and so forth. Those are three aspects. Economists tend to think about life satisfaction more. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And there are several economists who’ve been working on this for many years. David Blanchflower, who’s been one of the economists studying this, ',\n",
       "   ', the latest in a long line. And he talks about the happiness curve. And if you look at the curve, it’s a gigantic U, like a smile. And basically it starts measuring happiness at age 16. That’s when people are the happiest in these data, at least. And then it drops, and drops, and drops, and drops. And then it turns again at about age 50.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: To be precise, I think it’s about 47 to 48. And I only say that because I’m 49. So, this matters a lot to me. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, so you’re in for good times ahead. So here’s the question. If you believe the happiness curve, and that our happiness basically drops from teenagerhood, until whatever you want to call age 50 — middle age, late-middle age, middle-middle age. And then, it swings really hard upward for a long time. If you do believe that, why do you think that is the case? Is it that there are things happening in there? Is it adjustments? Is it habituation? You’re the psychologist. Tell us what. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: So I’ve seen this work by Blanchflower, and I will tell you that it’s very thorough. I think there’s good reason to believe it’s real. Generally, what Blanchflower is using is survey data, self-report. Usually the phrasing is, “How satisfied are you with your life?” I think it may be because as you hit that midlife period, you’re maybe under a combination of family stress, because parenting is not easy. And work stress. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And could it be that age 48 to 52 is when many parents are seeing their teenagers move out of the house? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: That is a possibility. These samples don’t only include married adults, but yes, one of the findings from marriage research is that so many married couples with children fear the empty-nest syndrome. But actually, on average, people tend to be happier once they’ve sort of gotten over the initial crying of your last kid being dropped off to college. I think there are other explanations, though. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: That’s what I want to hear. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Blanchflower doesn’t actually say that he knows. And I think that’s right to be humble about, “Okay, look, there’s this U-shaped happiness curve, but nobody really knows for sure what’s going on.” I want to suggest that when you’re in the beginning of life — and this is what I think might account for the downward slope in happiness until you reach your late 40s — you are striving, you are trying to attain goals maybe that you’re not reaching.',\n",
       "   'And if you think about what happiness is, it’s the achieving of the goals that you’ve set. And there are two ways to do that, right? One is to achieve those goals, and the other one is to have lower goals. So maybe the higher expectations that we have for what we hope for in life earlier, that accounts for why we’re downward sloping until a certain point, and then we reckon with what’s possible. And then, we’re happier. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Are you saying it’s— that there’s just less gap between our dream and reality? Or that we habituate and become more accepting of what we’ve got, even if it wasn’t what we hoped it might be? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, that’s a pretty nuanced distinction. But I agree, there’s setting lower goals, not having high expectations for your life. And then, alternatively, there’s keeping those high expectations, but having this distanced perspective, and very Zen about the fact that you missed those goals. But I think, either way, what it says is that the kind of increasing happiness that you are predicted to experience in your 50s, and your 60s, and so forth, are not because you’re actually objectively doing better, but because, in some way, you have subjectively changed the targets themselves. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Are you suggesting — and I think there is research that suggests this — that young people are unrealistically optimistic? And even if the answer to that is yes, can you really say that it is unwise, because maybe one of the things that you need a surplus of when you’re starting out is optimism, because in fact, it can be hard. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: There is a psychologist who I love named ',\n",
       "   '. He’s a judgment and decision-making scientist. And he believes that not only the young, but people of all ages, can be recklessly optimistic. And he thinks that this overconfidence is actually a problem. When he says this, entrepreneurs just leap out of the woodwork and they say, “You know, you got to be optimistic to get anything done!” ',\n",
       "   'And I think Don Moore would say, “No, it’s just better to be accurate.” And he has some experimental evidence to support that. I think that these high aspirations that young people have — rose-tinted movies in their head about what their wedding is going to be like, and how their children are going to be beautiful and perfect, and all these projections into the future — which are probably a little naive. I think you could ask the question whether they’re really unwise or not. I do think that if you reach higher, you’ll get farther, but you might be less happy doing it. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Since we see that measured happiness is very high at 16, and since you’re talking about reckless optimism is a feature of that age, how can you explain, then, the relatively very high and increasing suicide rate? Or maybe it does explain it. Maybe it’s that the cohort that are prone towards suicidal thoughts are those who see that gap between expectations and reality.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, first of all, I don’t want to say that optimism is inherently reckless. Some would say that it’s reckless. I wouldn’t use exactly that language. I might amend your question to say, “Look, if young people have these optimistic aspirations, how do we explain increasing rates of suicide and depression?” And I think that’s an excellent question. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: That’s the question I meant to ask. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I really don’t think anyone knows. I think the mystery of increasing rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are still exactly that — a mystery. One hypothesis that has been advanced is the same hypothesis that’s been advanced for why a lot of other people, who are not just young adults or adolescents, are unhappy. And that is that we do have this ratcheting up of expectations. ',\n",
       "   'And there is this gap between what we are achieving and our aspirations, not because we’re achieving less. We’re probably achieving more. I’m mean, we’re learning more. We’re having, in some cases, higher-quality experiences. But our aspirations are growing faster than our objective achievements. By the way, another possibility, Stephen, is that the people who are happier are just different from the people who are depressed, and they’re both growing in number and the middle’s getting carved out.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: If you do believe these data, what do you do with it? Let’s say, you’re a 16-year-old person. Let’s say, you’re a 50-year-old person. Let’s say, you’re a 75-year-old person. By the way, happiness does start to decline when you’re older. A lot of people around you are dying. Your own health is not doing so well. But if you see that big U in front of you, if you’re 16 or if you’re in the middle of the upslope, how do you hack that happiness curve? What do you do with that information? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Let’s start with the 16-year-old, because I have one. So, what would I say to one? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Condolences. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: She’s so wonderful! She’s actually a shockingly-happy 16-year-old. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: She’s all over the data. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: That’s right! She’s at the top of the curve. She just doesn’t know what’s ahead.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Also, we should say, the teenager can be happy while making the parents miserable.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yeah, I think what teenagers experience is actually, high highs and low lows. And there’s a lot of scientific evidence for that, too. I’m a university professor, so I see lots of 18- to 22-year-olds who have their fair share of angst. And they are experiencing the decrease in happiness. They have memories of being carefree children. And I think that downward slope, my guess is, is feeling the difference between what it was and what it is today. ',\n",
       "   'We’re very sensitive to changes. And to feel that everything was so simple then, and that you could eat an ice cream cone without guilt. They’re all of a sudden burdened with the weighty responsibilities of adulthood – their first career choices, their first disappointments professionally, or maybe major ones romantically. And when you’re sad it’s really hard to be convinced that you’ll ever not be sad. I like to tell young people who are in emotional turmoil, or experiencing the decrease in their emotional well-being, that life is long and that they won’t feel exactly this way forever. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Well let’s say you’re at the bottom right now. Right? Technically, you’re about there. So, how do you exploit the oncoming onslaught of happiness you’re about to experience? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I mean, other than just looking forward, which, of course, science says that we can actually derive pleasure from anticipated future rewards. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: The vacation you haven’t had yet is way better than the one you just had. Always. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Exactly. Aside from anticipating the future, this shift in your mindset from, “What’s going to happen? What could I do? What haven’t I yet done?” To, “Life is complicated, and there’s a lot to be grateful for.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I know that Blanchflower and his colleagues do suggest that one potential reason for the upswing in happiness around midlife is that you’ve seen people that you grew up with having really bad fortune, dying and whatnot. As you said, your gratitude may start to kick in a little bit more. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I mean, the cynical interpretation of that is it’s all downward social comparison. You look at people who, “Oh, my gosh, I can’t believe that happened.” And that somehow makes you feel better. I mean, just having some perspective, right? And that is something that 16-year-olds, God bless them, do not yet have in abundance. The wide-angle lens on life that allows you to appreciate a good cup of coffee and, wow, nothing went wrong today. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Wow. You really have lowered your expectations, haven’t you?',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I guess that’s why I’m so happy. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Let me ask you one last question. Let’s say that someone listening to this just wants to optimize their happiness, no matter how old they are, no matter what circumstances they’re in. One thing that strikes me about looking at the curve is, it feels too imprecise to see it grouped just by year of age. Right? If I’m 52 and supposed to be at the bottom of my happiness, about to climb, that doesn’t really relate to the things that actually happen day to day. How would you suggest people try to get rid of the things that make them unhappy and increase the ones that work? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Anytime you see a pretty graph that has a nice U or a line, you know it’s an average. It’s not exactly the same curve for everyone. But I think more to the point, what can I do to make my slope a little more steep? Or make my inflection point happen now and not a year from now? I think the key to so much of our emotional well-being is attention. For example, if I think of what happened in the last 24 hours, I mean, gosh, the mental landscape is vast. ',\n",
       "   'Attention is central because I can choose to either think of all the things that happened that were good or I can choose to think about things that were bad. And if I make no choice at all, ',\n",
       "   '. And that is why one of the most reliable interventions to increase happiness is called the “three blessings exercise.” And you simply think of three good things that happened, usually in the last 24 hours. And you rattle them off. I’ve gotten so good at it. I can do it usually in 10 or 15 seconds: Lucy, Amanda, the avocado was ripe.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Wait. Just naming your children fulfills the three? That’s what you’re saying?',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I know you’re going to say that’s a cheat, or how is that possible? But when I bring my kids to mind, I’m like, “Lucy’s healthy, Amanda finished her midterms.” I mentioned the avocado, I don’t want to put that on the same level as my children. But it was a miracle of God that the avocado was actually not too ripe and not underripe.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Just so you know, that avocado was probably grown in Mexico where the avocado ranch is run by a criminal cartel killing and extorting innocent people. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I’ve got blood on my hands. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But if that makes you happy, Angela, that’s fine. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: There you go focusing on the negative, Stephen. You have so much to learn. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Stephen. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Angela. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: You do a lot of writing and podcasting. I would say these are creative pursuits. Are you sublimating? And do you need me to define sublimating for you? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: This is the psychological form of sublimating and not the chemical form of sublimating, I assume? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I didn’t mean going from a solid to a gas.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Without bothering to stop and become a liquid along the way.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: You could say that you’re going right to gas form and bypassing liquid. I wasn’t thinking that. No. I meant like Freud. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Sure. Why don’t you tell me what Freud meant by sublimation? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, this is what I think Freud meant. You know, having not known Freud personally, but Freud had this idea that pretty much all of human behavior could be explained by these unconscious conflicts that we had deep in our psyche. And that when you had to deal with the pain of these conflicts, like wanting to marry your mother, but not being able to, or wanting to do things that you couldn’t do, you would, in some cases, have a mature response and some cases have a less-mature response. ',\n",
       "   'But they were all coping mechanisms. ',\n",
       "   'And sublimation was a coping response that he would have said was a mature coping response that was essentially taking your pain and transforming it, primarily through art or through creativity. Or more recently, as Carrie Fisher, the actress, said, “It is taking a broken heart and turning it into art.” Freud didn’t say that, but I think Freud would have endorsed that. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Let me say first, I did love my mother, but I never wanted to marry her.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, Freud wouldn’t believe you, by the way.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I know he wouldn’t. And I have my differences with Freud.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: He would say, “There he goes coping.”',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But now the way you just described sublimation is, well, I don’t know if it’s a broader or different definition from my understanding of Freud’s definition of it, which I thought was more tied to sexual drive than just pain. Are you asking me this question because ',\n",
       "   ' is such a sexy show, and you’re wondering where that comes from? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yes, of course that’s why I was asking you, Stephen. No, I wasn’t asking you that. I think Freud had it right that we have needs and drives and that sometimes, in ways that we’re not fully aware of, we’re trying to meet them. But I don’t think it was all about sex. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, are you asking whether something like writing or a creative thing, podcasting, whatever, is my form of sublimation? Or just whether I believe in sublimation? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I am asking you particularly about your creative process. Now, Freud would say that this is a waste of time, because Freud would say that you can’t ask somebody directly to introspect. But I think Freud was wrong, by the way. I think if Freud would have lived long enough to see modern psychotherapy, he would’ve seen that he’s wrong. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I would say I do often think about why it is that I, or anyone who is excited and passionate about doing what they do, where the drive comes from. Why is this the thing that I do? And why does this thing still drive me to want to do it after doing it for a long time? And the thing that is what I do is essentially ask questions. ',\n",
       "   'In fact, the reason I started a podcast years and years ago was that my favorite part of reporting and research was often interviewing and speaking with people. And it’s always heartbreaking when you write a magazine piece or a book, the vast majority of what people said was cut out, just because of the way the medium of text writing works. I really wanted more of the interview left intact, more of the conversation. And the reason I’m so drawn to that is because the act of asking questions, it does feel like magic — in that, when I was a kid, I was really super, super shy.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Really? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Yeah. I mean, honestly, I’m still shy.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Some psychologist I am. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Well, I think I fake it pretty well.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yeah, you do. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But if you give me the choice between, here’s a group of people and you can go up to them and have a conversation, or there’s a book or a bunch of golf balls and a fairway to hit, I’m always going to go for the solo thing. But one thing about asking questions, because my dad was a journalist, my mom was a writer, although not professionally at all. She was a full-time mom with eight kids. But she’d been a ballerina, so she had a kind of way of looking at the world that had a creative angle to it. And even in my little family, we had a family newspaper. And the thing that I loved about journalism from the time I was about 3 was that it allowed you — in some cases forced you — to go up to people and ask them questions that I simply wouldn’t have had the nerve to do otherwise.',\n",
       "   'So I don’t know enough about sublimation to say whether what I do daily is an act of sublimation. But I do know that I love what I do in part because it is connected to something that, for me, was a deep-rooted — I don’t know if I would call it pain or suffering, necessarily — but something that wanted to be gotten over. And so, it’s one of the reasons that I’m most grateful that I get to have a living based on this thing that is actually mostly incredibly fun and scratches an itch that’s otherwise really hard to scratch. So, I don’t know if it’s about marrying my mother. In fact, I think it’s quite not, but I’m probably doing a whole lot of sublimating without knowing it. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Your desire to connect with other people, which shy people have as well as extroverted people have, you found a way. You found a solution, which is being a question-asking journalist who gets very intimate with your subjects. You probably also love that the interview has an end and then you’re just, “Okay, bye. That was great.” You get to scratch the itch, but you don’t have to deal with the things that you felt uncomfortable with either at the beginning or the end of these interactions. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I also do probably 95 percent of my interviews remotely, which means that I’m in my home or office recording studio and somebody else is somewhere else. I don’t actually even have to make eye contact. I mean, I know how to make eye contact. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: I’ve had conversations with you in-person. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I can replicate a normal human pretty well. I’m adaptive in that way. But it’s very costly to my immune system. And, I’m exhausted after an hour-long conversation with some other human. Ugh. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Even when you’re in journalism mode? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Well, that’s a whole other level, because not only is it a conversation with a stranger, but your mind is constantly trying to process and then get to the next place, knowing that there’s a limited amount of time. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Okay. So, what’s more exhausting? You’re having an interview. You’re processing it on multiple levels and then you’re synthesizing it in real time. Versus a cocktail party conversation for the same amount of time with a stranger as well, but now in this very different setting and it’s no longer Stephen, the journalist. It’s just Stephen, the cocktail party invitee.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Yeah. I would say the cocktail party is more exhausting only because what you’re subtracting is usually the exhilaration of the conversation. Not that every interview is exhilarating, but the conversations in the podcast aren’t just casual conversations with people I happen to want to talk to. You’re trying to find out information. You’re trying to learn something specific about some scenario or phenomenon or whatever. And so, you’ve got a goal. Plus, you have to factor in if alcohol is a factor, which at cocktail parties it usually is and in interviews it’s usually not. That’s a big instrumental variable, honestly, in human interaction. So, maybe I should drink more while interviewing, or interview more while drinking less at cocktail parties. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: You could try it. You could try a little experiment.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Yeah, but I feel that, as with many questions that are asked, that the person asking the question really is interested in answering the question. So, what about you? For you, being a research psychologist, to what degree is that a form of sublimation? You chose to become a research psychologist. You teach, too, and you write. But most people, when they think of a psychologist, they think of a clinical psychologist. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Or, as I like to say, a “real psychologist.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Well, okay. You didn’t go that route. You didn’t want to engage in therapy or clinical treatment, and you went this way. Is what you do a form of sublimation? And why did you go that route instead of the clinical route? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, before I was in graduate school, I remember filling out the application to go to graduate school. And there was a box that said, “Do you want clinical training? Yes or no?” And I asked my soon-to-be adviser, ',\n",
       "   ', famous psychologist and a clinical psychologist. I said, “What does this question mean?” And he said, “Oh, well, think of the most boring person you went to college with. Do you have a clear picture of that person in mind? Okay. Now think about being in a small room with them for 40 hours a week. If the answer is, ‘I would love to do that,’ then check yes, right?” That’s literally what he said. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: That’s terrible. I mean, it’s wonderful, but it’s terrible.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yeah. So actually, I was pretty prepared to still check yes, because, he then elaborated that’s also the box that you check “yes” if you really want to help people. I was like, “Oh, it seems like a good box to check.” For me, it was partly logistical. Because when you become a clinical psychologist, you have to do your Ph.D., and then you have to go on a residency or an internship. And I was already 32 and pregnant with my second daughter. I knew we wouldn’t be able to move in four or five years. So, I thought that wouldn’t be the right move for me. ',\n",
       "   'But I will tell you this, Stephen. I think in principle I would really have wanted to be a clinical psychologist and actually help people directly, but also, that I’d be pretty bad at it. I’d probably spend the whole hour talking about myself. I’d be like, “Oh my God, that reminds me of a story. Just hold on! Let me just.” I would be a terrible therapist. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Well, I disagree. And maybe that’s only because you’ve had the last bunch of years to be doing research that actually produces insights that, I think, are really practical. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Don’t overestimate me. Okay. So, am I sublimating in my own career? Am I redirecting some inner tension to some productive end like my research? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Is it possible to not be?',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Well, let me start by saying I think Freud was right about a lot of things. In the kind of broadest brushstrokes, the idea that we do a lot of things to avoid psychological pain, I think he was spot on. I do believe that a lot of things that I do are defense mechanisms, in a sense, right? Things that avoid pain. I am sure that in my life, that I have been coping with things, like trying to get needs met, but probably the explanations are a little less exciting than unresolved sexual conflict and much more in the realm of, like, I grew up in a family where achievement was important.',\n",
       "   'When I was when I was a little girl and my dad would say things like, “The meaning of life is not to be happy, the meaning of life is to be successful.” So, I think maybe you could argue that the fact that I grew up then to study achievement and then, I am so obviously achievement-oriented. In my family, I felt anyway, like love was somewhat proportionately meted out according to your accomplishments. So you get a little more love the day you get into Harvard. And I think that that probably did motivate me to please my father and to be more accomplished. Maybe that’s a form of sublimation. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Can you think of other professions that would have fulfilled you similarly?',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Let’s see. I could have become a doctor. Freud said that so much of this happens below the level of awareness that we’ll never know. But I think I know why I really didn’t want to become a doctor. And that’s because my parents really wanted me to become a doctor. And I was trying to go contra-stereotype, I think partly. There was a point in my life — this is in my late 20s — where I was wrestling with what to do. And I thought I might want to be something in human resources.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And in a way, H.R. is very similar to some pieces of psychology, right? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Human impact. Yeah. And human nature.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I don’t know if I ever told you this. When I quit playing music, so that was my first profession, I had three things that I thought I might be not terrible at. One, for some reason, was financial planner. Because even though I didn’t know much about the markets and economics, I was really interested in it. And I thought there’s so much bad advice out there that if I could get even somewhere above terrible, it would be really fun to help people. ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: A net positive. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. So, that was one, and I didn’t do that. And then I went to grad school for writing and I thought I would teach writing in college. I did teach at Columbia for a year. And it was super exhilarating because the students were brilliant. And I just realized I was way too selfish. I wanted to spend my time on my writing, not on other people’s writing. But that was the reason also why I didn’t do No. 3, which was I thought really hard about becoming a psychologist, a therapist.',\n",

I loved the idea that there was a methodology, and a huge canon, and a bunch of brilliant people who had spent their entire lives and careers in research trying to figure out how people think the way they do, how to change patterns, habits, etc. I thought, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful to read that for several years and then help people with that understanding?” But I quickly came to the conclusion, as did you, that I would not want to be in that room with that person for more than five minutes, just out of selfishness.',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: Can I just say, in defense of us, most of the therapists I know are some of the wooliest bundle of anxieties, neuroses, misplaced dreams, and so on. Because the way you were describing why we would fail was because, basically, we’re not the angels that therapists are. And I’m just here to say that many of the therapists I know — and they would be the first to admit it — they’re not the angels either.',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Yeah, that’s fair enough. They’re just human. But I don’t know if this counts as Freudian sublimation, but you do get to scratch the itch of connecting with people and exploring human nature. I frankly have no plausible explanation for your desire to be a financial planner, but everything else fits it. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Question: what is the opposite of sublimation? ',\n",
       "   'DUCKWORTH: Going directly from a gas to a solid without passing through liquid. Well, okay. If you want to take the Freudian hierarchy of defenses from the most mature, which is sublimation, but there are also some others — humor, altruism — like turning your pain of not being able to have a child and then, for example, spending a lot of your energy in charity work for mothers or something. That would be altruism. And then there were the immature defenses which are other coping mechanisms that had the effect of getting you into more trouble, right? Narcissism, denial — famously, passive aggression. I mean, people use this term vernacularly without probably even knowing that that’s Freudian in its origins.',\n",

And if you survey people immediately after a meeting, one person is invariably more positive than everyone else. And this one person is the meeting leader. The person who’s leading the meeting says, “Hey, this is really good.” And why wouldn’t they feel that? They’re controlling the whole experience. They’re talking the most. They’re like, “Hey this is nirvana.” But everyone else is reporting much more negative experiences.',\n",

Now this is jarring, because senior managers are the ones calling the most meetings. So if senior managers are calling them unproductive, we know we have a problem.',\n",

They think carefully about how that meeting should be facilitated. And we do this all the time when it comes to meetings we have with customers. When we meet with a customer, we think about that in advance. But when it comes to employee meetings, we just dial it in. We rely on habits. And a great example is the research shows that 50 percent of agendas are recycled. We would never do that with customers.',\n",

And at the same time, technology makes it so easy for us to just hijack someone’s calendar. And the research shows that larger meetings are just filled with additional dysfunction. While people generally complain about having a meeting, they complain just as much if they are not invited to a meeting. Given this reality, there’s a couple of things that we can do. So first of all, we can actually design the agenda such that part of the agenda is relevant to a large group of individuals, and then part of it is relevant to a smaller section of that. So a big group attends for part of the meeting and then people leave. And then it’s a smaller group that has additional discussion. And what a leader can do is once they start thinking about meeting attendees as being core vs. secondary, that can be a very useful distinction.',\n",

If you have any input on these topics, please feel free to email me. I will also show you the minutes of the meeting. And at any point down the road you want to go to future meetings you’re more than welcome.” And people really appreciate being given, arguably, the best gift in the world right now. Which is time.',\n",
       "   'PARKER: The more specific your purpose is, the more people can actually see themselves and say, “What I do is not actually relevant to that.” So don’t make exclusion personal. Make it purposeful.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, I need some personal advice, because I try to avoid meetings as much as possible, so I’m showing my bias. I don’t typically enjoy meetings. But also because of what I do for a living, I just want my days unencumbered. I want my days for reading, writing, thinking, and interviewing people, and I don’t want meetings. So, sometimes they’re unavoidable, and sometimes they’re great and useful. I don’t mean to rain on them. But one thing I don’t like is when you arrange a meeting with someone, it’s usually via email, and then they send me a calendar invite. But I don’t want somebody else’s software living on my computer. And then every time there’s an update to it, I get another alert. I don’t want the distraction. I took the time to plan the meeting. I know how to plan a meeting. I put it in my calendar. I’ll be there. You’re not — you don’t feel my pain. That’s okay. We can move on.',\n",
       "   'PARKER: I actually think it’s actually very deep. So we live in an age where— you’re talking about software, but basically we live in a multicultural, diverse, “everybody is kind of their own island but also all sorts of other things” world. And we’re all gathering all of the time. And gathering at some level is a form of imposition.',\n",

       "   'PARKER: Well, actually what I love about how you’re talking about it is, it should be thought of as a form of imposition. And you only take the meetings or the gatherings where you think that you are willing to tolerate that imposition. And what you’re talking about is— I actually think your instinct to say, “I want to have my days free, I want to think, I want to write, I want to interview,” is a much healthier instinct, because you’re raising the bar for anything to get through to you. For many of the companies and organizations I work with, I don’t say gather more, I say gather better. In many cases that means gather less.',\n",
       "   'ROGELBERG: So, it starts late. A person arrives 10 minutes late, and then the leader says, “Okay, we can start now.” Or worse yet it’s the leader herself or himself that shows up late. And then they start the meeting with a whole bunch of news and announcements. Things that clearly could have been communicated in other mechanisms. Then the leader says, “I have a really important issue to talk about.” And they start talking about that issue, and they dominate the discussion. And then another person in the meeting starts to dominate the discussion. And, next thing you know, the leader looks at her or his watch and says, “Oh gosh, we’re out of time. But you know what? Let’s run 10 minutes after the meeting time, just to see if we can close the loop.” And says, “Okay. Look, I’ve heard from you all.” But in effect, they’ve only heard from one or two people. And the other people either didn’t have a chance to speak or were completely irrelevant to the discussion. ',\n",
       "   'So the meeting ends 10 minutes later than it should. The leader thinks that there was a good decision made, but no one else feels that way. And they go back to work and they go, “Oy vey. What just happened?” It’s called Meeting Recovery Syndrome. What we find is that when people have bad meetings, they don’t necessarily just leave it at the door. It sticks with them. They ruminate, they co-ruminate, and they even report it negatively affecting their productivity after the meeting.',\n",

       "   'PARKER: She started her meetings by saying, “Let’s everybody do a rose and a thorn,” which is sort of this old exercise of like, what’s the best part of your week, what’s the worst part of your week. And that’s just the first 10 minutes, the rest of the 50 minutes was used for “business.” And she called me up and she said, my meetings have transformed. And I said, why? And she said, “Well first, our team has changed over time because the risks people take vary week to week. Some people share silly stuff. Some people share deep stuff. Some people share stuff from work, some people share stuff from over the weekend. It’s actually changed what’s allowable in the conversation.”',\n",
       "   'She’s like, “But the second thing that has been most interesting is — I didn’t realize this — but people have started to say more real stuff in the context of work, because by starting the meeting with including a thorn as the base default, I didn’t realize I was playing a role as cheerleader, and they didn’t think that I could handle, or wanted, to have 50-50 thorns. It’s changed the norms of what’s acceptable and what we talk about for the rest of the meeting.”',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So Priya, you write that businesses tend to “run on a cult of positivity.” What do you mean by that, and how do you counter it?',\n",
       "   'PARKER: Whether it is panels that are asking guests to talk about all of their successes or launch a product, or whether it is a meeting in which you’re talking about how wonderful or how great things are. And so part of the unwinding of the cult of positivity is to go back and ask, what is the purpose of this gathering? And often, positivity prevents progress.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Talk about the difference between generous authority and ungenerous, or as you term it, imperious authority.',\n",
       "   'PARKER: Part of the role of a host is to practice generous authority. And I define generous authority to do three things with your guest. First is to connect them to each other and to the purpose. To protect them from each other. And to temporarily equalize them. Because in any type of group people will fall into the default patterns that they always fall into. Whether they know people or not. And your role as a host is to temporarily allow them to behave in a way that helps you collectively go to that purpose.',\n",
       "   'ROGELBERG: So if I’m a meeting leader, I can do different things. Instead of asking people to prepare in advance, you allocate the very first part of the meeting to reading the preparatory materials because at that point at least you know everyone has done it.\\xa0',\n",

Even if I have a large group of folks, and I want them to engage strongly on a topic, if I have people pair up and work in dyads, even just for a few minutes, and then come back together as a group, me having folks work in dyad changes the whole dynamic of the large group discussion. The level of communication and passion will be much higher.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'But what we know from the research is that left to just the standard protocols of people talking, that a decision better than what would have just been produced by the best individual in the room only occurs 20 percent of the time. So, most typically, meeting performance is just not optimal.',\n",
       "   'The problem with meetings is that the proportion of good use of time and bad use of time is out of whack. I think that’s the critical issue. It’s just figuring out how can we increase the proportion of good time over bad time. Good time is when the attendees of the meeting are interacting in a genuine way such that the decisions and solutions being generated might surpass what any one individual could have done by themselves. And that time is not necessarily free of conflict. In fact, we want conflict in meetings. What we don’t want is personal conflict, but we want conflict around ideas. So if you have a group going to battle with incredible passion around ideas — that is a fantastic meeting. Especially if it’s a safe environment and people go, “Wow, that was amazing that we could have this level of disagreement. But in a way that does not castrate everyone in the room.”',\n",

       "   'PARKER: I was brought into an architecture firm — a 70-years-old architecture firm — to figure out their vision for the future. And they were debating whether to maintain being an architecture firm — which meant, in their case, whether to continue to be bricks and mortar, building buildings — or whether to pivot and become a design firm. And there was real disagreement in the firm. But you wouldn’t know it by being in the room. And any time someone would say something even related to one of the possible visions, everyone else would shrink back. They weren’t willing to go there. And it was very polite.',\n",
       "   'So during the coffee break, my client said to me — he literally whispered to me, “Priya, we need more heat.” And so we paused and thought, okay, basically the norm of politeness in this context is too strong for good controversy to happen through the way they normally meet. We quickly, in Photoshop, took two of the photos of the architects’ heads and slapped them on wrestlers’ bodies. We printed them out and put them on two walls — one side was the head, meaning design, and the other was the body, meaning the future would be architecture, bricks and mortar. And the architects came back. And we basically said, “Welcome back to the cage match. In one corner” — I was the emcee, I was like — “In one corner you have the body, and the other you have the head.” And fortunately for us, the two architects were game. And so they started jeering and raising their hands over their shoulders. We assigned coaches to each of the sides, they threw white towels around their neck, we played the\\xa0',\n",

And I said each side has two minutes to say the strongest possible argument for the future of the vision of the firm, whether it’s architecture or design. And then they get two minutes for rebuttal. And everybody else — this was the key insight — everybody else has to physically choose a side. No neutrality and no wallflowers. And what that did was, it broke the norm of implicit consensus, which there wasn’t.',\n",

In any room, there’s troublemakers and smoother-overs.',\n",

And one of the things that I often do in groups is have people raise their hand, who’s a troublemaker, who is a smoother-over, and then I ask, who’s both? And people who are both — and there are always a few in a group — are the ones who are most likely to be part of transformational conversations. And that’s because as a troublemaker, you’re willing to poke and prod and you’re not afraid of a little heat. But as a smoother-over, you’re also interested in repair and coming together. And going back to our earlier conversation, most human connection and gatherings suffer more from unhealthy peace than from unhealthy conflict.

I often come away feeling energized because I’ve thought of a new question to test or an algorithm to implement. And sure, maybe science is inherently more fun and exploratory than other careers, but I think one of the reasons these meetings are so effective in general is that people with distinct skills and perspectives are coming together with the shared goal of helping their colleague improve.',\n",

So we went behind the building in the loading dock, all of us got really high.

Well, you can daydream. You can make lists. Or you can multitask. That’s how you can reclaim your power. So one of the techniques is trying to build a break in the middle of a meeting.

       "'Kevin BERESFORD: Yes, I’m a member of the Dull Men’s Club.  Stephen DUBNER Let me make sure I’m understanding you correctly. It’s called the Dull Men’s Club, yes? “Dull” as in boring?  BERESFORD Yeah. Dull is the new black. It’s sexy being dull. Women like dull men. They know we’re not going to run off with Lady Gaga or something.  DUBNER: Yeah understood. We’re very reliable.  BERESFORD: Exactly.  Kevin Beresford  BERESFORD: I’m the president of the U.K. Roundabout Appreciation Society, also known as Lord of the Rings. That’s my official title.  no traffic light or stop sign  substantially larger than roundabouts  BERESFORD: All this came about in the year 2003. I ran a small printers in the town of Redditch, in Worcestershire, England.   BERESFORD:   We didn’t have a lot going for us in that town. We had three prisons, but no cinema. We did have a 24-hour Tesco, but that was about our limit. What we did have was a copious amount of roundabouts. So just for a giggle — I’ll be honest here, just for a giggle — we ran off a roundabout calendar to give to our customers. And I couldn’t believe the feedback I got. It sold all around the world.   BERESFORD: Yeah, in the old days, we used to meet on a bi-monthly basis in a pub called The Black Tap. We would swap data and roundabouts that we’d come about, maybe from where you’ve been on holidays.   DUBNER: And I hope you’ll get back to all that once the pandemic recedes. But when you get together in the pub to discuss all things roundabout — no offense, Kevin, but what’s there to discuss?  BERESFORD: Well, it’s the esthetic quality of the roundabouts. I mean, I’ve seen fountains, statues, planes, boats, trains, pubs, churches. There’s even up, in Yorkshire, a working windmill that actually produces flour. Can you believe that? On a roundabout! And that’s the beauty of a roundabout. Anything can go on a roundabout.  DUBNER: Now, have you named your best roundabout of the year for 2020?  BERESFORD: The English one is the Flanders Roundabout in Ashford, in Kent. It represents the First World War. You’ve got seven British Tommy soldiers, all with their heads bowed, with a vintage World War tank, and even the trees that have been planted there are from Flanders. It’s very poignant. But our international roundabout, now, that’s quite a quirky one. The international roundabout of the year is a gay gyratory. Can you believe it? It’s the first of its kind. It’s in Australia, in Canberra.  DUBNER: And what makes it a gay roundabout?  BERESFORD: It’s a rainbow, colored rainbow, roundabout. How beautiful is that?  DUBNER: Oh, yeah, I see it now. I just looked it up. From above, it looks like a target, with the colors of the rainbow emanating out. It’s very beautiful. It’s very small, this one, yeah?  BERESFORD: Yeah. Size isn’t everything, is it? The fact is anything can go on a roundabout, and this is a great example. That city of Canberra,   . So, that was the present from the gay community.   BERESFORD: If I came to America, and my mission was to put the roundabout into America, I’d save thousands of lives. In fact, that might be my mission, now, talking to you guys.  that more than 35,000 Americans are killed  quarter of those deaths  a quarter-trillion dollars  Freakonomics Radio  Jim BRAINARD: Couple of million dollars per intersection.  Doug HECOX: The emissions is less, significantly less.  Oliver CAMERON: You’d be stuck there at the entrance to a roundabout forever.  DUBNER: Tell us a little bit about Carmel, Indiana. I know it is —I’m not sure if “suburb” is the right word —but it sits right next to Indianapolis.  BRAINARD: We like to use the term “edge city.” Because it is a growing city on the edge of Indianapolis.  Jim Brainard  BRAINARD: Our   . When I became mayor in 1996, it had about 25,000 people in it.   DUBNER: Holy cow!  BRAINARD: So we’ve had a lot of growth.  , which is double the size of   .  DUBNER: But a little less dense.  BRAINARD: A little less dense. Although we’ve worked really hard to build a walkable, pedestrian-friendly downtown.  DUBNER: So as I understand it, Mr. Mayor, Carmel is particularly famous for —or at least prolific in its use of —a particular traffic pattern, yes?  BRAINARD: We have built more roundabouts than any other city in the United States or North America and perhaps the world. We have 133, with a handful under construction as we speak. There’s about 15 traffic lights left in our city. All but one of those I would like to see converted to a roundabout. Then we’ll pretty much be finished.  U.S. total at around 7,000  as many as 25,000 roundabouts  as many as 50,000 roundabouts  BRAINARD: I had seen a roundabout when I was doing graduate study in England, back in the early ’80s. And so I asked one of our consulting engineers to design a couple for a new road we were building on the east side of Carmel.  BRAINARD: And he says, “No, I won’t put my professional stamp on them. They’re taking these things out of New England. They’re dangerous.”  quite common in New England  BRAINARD: And so the next weekend, I drove up to Purdue University, to their engineering library, and found a bunch of articles about the differences between roundabouts and rotaries. And I took these articles back and handed them to the engineer and said, “Please read these.”   around 36,000 deaths and 2.75 million injuries  BRAINARD: Roundabouts are smaller and because they’re smaller, everybody has to drive through them slowly. It’s about speed.   around 40 miles per hour  forces vehicles to slow down     BRAINARD: Everybody has sped up, even when that stoplight is green, to get through before it changes. And sometimes we drive through a pink light too.  BRAINARD: And the human error rate doesn’t really change. So the question is, what type of accident are we going to have? Well, if you sped up to go through a yellow light or a pink light or even a green light, and somebody makes a mistake — it can be a very bad accident. At slower speeds, it’s not nearly as dangerous. And it’s safer for pedestrians, it’s safer for the handicapped, it’s safer for blind people.   HECOX: Roundabouts allow the intersection to manage itself, in a manner of speaking.  Doug Hecox  HECOX: Drivers have to negotiate that circle a little bit more slowly, and it invites a little bit more of a conscientious driver by having to slow down and look around and accommodate oncoming traffic. And it’s just for a short period of time, usually just a few seconds, but that can be all the difference that it takes to save lives.  HECOX: There are significant impacts, pardon the pun, associated with having roundabouts.   4.2 million miles of public road  HECOX: They are a proven safety countermeasure, because the track record speaks for itself. The numbers tell the story.  BRAINARD: So the U.S.,   .  Jim Brainard again. That figure he’s citing —traffic deaths per year per 100,000 people —is actually a bit high. It’s now more like 12 deaths per 100,000 people.   Still, how does that compare to Carmel?  BRAINARD: Carmel is at two per 100,000.  DUBNER: And you’re going to attribute most of that benefit to roundabouts then, yes?  BRAINARD: This is attributable to roundabouts. Because almost all fatalities happen in intersections because of the conflicting traffic flows. We had no fatalities last year in our intersections. The fatalities were in other places, a motorcycle that collided with a tree. An elderly gentleman that walked out right in front of a vehicle, we’re not sure why he did that.  We’ve done this chart of people in other cities around Indiana. One community has about 50,000 in southern Indiana, has 30 deaths per year per 100,000. Another one is in the 20s. Indianapolis is just below 12. And so you can then extrapolate their population of close to a million people, and see if they had all roundabouts, how many people would still be alive that aren’t? It’s a very sort of sobering analysis when you do that.  BRAINARD: It tends to be how familiar the drivers are with that intersection.   Roundabouts do tend to produce more non-fatal crashes that lead to property damage, usually to the vehicles themselves. Driving on a curve rather than a straight line — especially if you’re unfamiliar with that particular intersection — that can lead to more fender-benders or encounters with the center island in the roundabout.  well less than half the U.S. rate  cutting down on the number of drivers rushing to make the light  vehicle is trying to cross at a perpendicular angle  HECOX: Sure, sure.  HECOX: Many in the environmental community like the fact that because traffic isn’t stopped, like it is at a traditional signalized intersection, you don’t have vehicles idling and therefore the emissions from those idling vehicles is less. Significantly less. And so the air quality is improved.  BRAINARD: Our city engineer has calculated how many tons of carbon we save every year.  BRAINARD: We think that we save on average around two, three million dollars a year of fuel for the general public by replacing stop lights.  does significantly cut fuel consumption  Mike McBRIDE: A traffic signal is not efficient at all.  Mike McBride  McBRIDE: That role can vary from city to city, but in the City of Carmel, the city engineer manages all transportation network issues.  Including, in this case, the construction of roundabouts. During his tenure, McBride oversaw the building of roughly 90 roundabouts. As of the mid-1990’s,   .  McBRIDE: But in 1996, Mayor Jim Brainard became the mayor of Carmel.  McBRIDE: So the the owner of the company came back to my desk and he said, “What do you know about roundabouts?” And I said, “What’s a roundabout?” So that was my introduction to roundabouts. He said, “Well, learn everything you can because you’re our new expert.”  MCBRIDE: Signalized intersections are definitely more familiar to people, so they’ve got a much wider public acceptance than roundabouts. But really, signalized intersections are designed for maximum efficiency, basically about an hour-and-a-half a day — maybe 45 minutes in the A.M. peak hour and 45 minutes in the P.M. peak hour. That’s about 20 percent of the daily traffic. We’ve all been sitting at an intersection, at a red light, when there are no opposing traffic cars where we’re just sitting there, burning fuel, wasting our time. Well, a roundabout, it does very well in those peak hours. And we know it’s safer. And at maximum efficiency is the other twenty-two-and-a-half hours a day, whatever that might be. So when you think about it from a sustainability and a reduction-of-fuel-consumption standpoint, roundabouts really have the upper hand.  can take up more space than a standard intersection  Zachary CROCKETT: My name is   , and I’m a reporter who’s obsessed with the economics of everyday things.  DUBNER: It seems like you cast your eye on a lot of things that a lot of people walk past and don’t think about. How do you do that?  CROCKETT: One thing I do is I’m an active member of probably 200 Facebook groups. So, my feed is posts from Dogecoin traders and doomsday preppers, chicken farmers, all kinds of niche communities.   DUBNER: And we should say you’re not a chicken farmer or a Dogecoin investor. Is that true?  CROCKETT: Neither of those is true.  been around since the 1920s  one signalized intersection per 1,000 residents  CROCKETT: If we hold that to be true, we’re looking at somewhere around 330,000 signalized intersections in the United States.  CROCKETT: If you walk up to the standard intersection in San Mateo, California, where I’m from, you might see 16 different signal heads with three sets of lights each and then maybe four to eight poles. You’ve got four to eight of those push buttons for pedestrian crossings. You’ve got a bunch of underground wiring and brackets and custom-made hardware. So, that standard four-way signalized intersection, it likely costs more than your house. All in, you’re looking at anywhere from   .  CROCKETT: So, for starters, there’s the material costs and there’s the labor costs. And it’s about 50 percent for the design, the engineering, the development work, and then another 50 percent for the materials and construction.  CROCKETT: Well, my favorite signal head is the   , manufactured in the great city of Anaheim, California. They’re around $2,000 or $3,000 a pop. When they’re up there dangling in the sky, they look tiny. But when you’re confronted with one face-to-face, they’re behemoths.  CROCKETT: There are really only a few companies in the United States that manufacture them. They can easily set a city back $25,000 a pop. And they can take up to 10 months to get. The reason they take so long is that really there’s some crazy engineering that goes into the process. They have to be hurricane-resistant. And these are thousand-pound beams that are hanging over our heads. There’s a lot riding on whether or not they stay in place.   CROCKETT: It’s like the size of a mini-fridge. And inside, there’s a bird’s nest of wires and flashing lights and computers. It’s kind of the brains of the operation. The controller usually runs around $30,000.  CROCKETT: The wiring has a very dramatic range in cost. It can be like $3 a foot to $100 a foot. It’s not the wiring itself. It’s more what the wiring requires. Sometimes you have to do underground drilling and routing and you have to rearrange an entire intersection to accommodate for the wiring.  CROCKETT: Altogether, those might run around $20,000 per signalized intersection.   CROCKETT: Traffic-signal technicians — they’ve truly seen it all. The Florida hurricanes. Drunk drivers plowing into massive steel beams that require months of reconstruction. Rats for some reason   . Signal heads need to be constantly repainted and hardware needs to be re-affixed. There was an    —pigeon excrement once   .   CROCKETT: “A large number of pigeons had been defecating on an insulator. The pile of crap got so huge that it dripped down a meter length of the insulator and caused a short triggering an automatic shutdown  DUBNER: How much has the technology changed over the past, let’s say, 50 years for traffic lights generally?   CROCKETT: One of the major innovations in recent years, which is actually pretty simple, is the transition from incandescent to L.E.D. bulbs. So, a lot of cities have made that big switch. And it’s dramatically reduced their electricity bills.  DUBNER: I know L.E.D. bulbs   , although they also last longer. Are there other downsides to the L.E.D. bulb?  CROCKETT: So, one thing we’ve seen happen is that in Midwestern states like Illinois or Minnesota, the L.E.D. bulbs save on energy, but they actually didn’t produce enough heat to melt snow in the winter. So that obscures vision for drivers. And at one point, it caused a   . So, those cheaper L.E.D. bulbs had to be affixed with these special heat-lamp attachments that negated any savings that they would have had.  CROCKETT: The Federal Highway Administration, they estimate that traffic signals account for about 295 million vehicle hours of traffic delays per year. If you work it out based on median household income figures, it’s about $2 billion in lost time.  BRAINARD: Well, there is a couple of different analyses we need to look at. First of all, if you’re converting a four-way stop to a roundabout, the roundabout is always going to be less expensive.  BRAINARD: So you got operating costs in addition to that. You have to send engineers out to reset the timing, which somehow gets off on a regular basis. And then every 25, 30 years, you have to replace that apparatus. And then you have a cost in a thunderstorm, the electricity goes out, you have to send a police officer out to direct traffic at a traffic light. The roundabout keeps working.  already has traffic lights  BRAINARD: There’s a substantial cost. Couple of million dollars per intersection, probably on average. Because you’re taking out that light, you’re probably buying some additional land in the corners. You have to move underground utilities out from under the light.  DUBNER: And what’s that do to real estate and accessibility to that real estate — whether it’s shopping or doctor’s offices or so on. If I’ve got a four-way, traffic-light intersection, presumably you’ve got a business on every corner. With the roundabout, do you diminish your commercial access to the point where the cost savings from the roundabout itself, you’re maybe losing that savings because you’re surrendering commercial opportunity?  BRAINARD: I don’t think so. You know, sometimes businesses say, “I like the cars stopped at a stoplight looking at my business.” Well, that’s not what we’re about. We’re trying to get traffic in and out safely and efficiently. We’re not meant to market your business with a stoplight. Here’swhere it helps the businesses: you know, if you can’t get in and out of an area because it’s congested, people are going to avoid that area. We can move    through a roundabout than you can a stoplight.  DUBNER: So here’s my big question. You make a very compelling argument for roundabouts. And you’ve built more roundabouts than, sounds like, just about anybody has. If they’re so great, why is every city in America not copying you?  BRAINARD: A lot are. There is a large movement in the United States, to build roundabouts. There’s incentives in federal transportation law, particularly in areas that have bad air quality. Some state D.O.T.’s, Department of Transportations, are   . I’ve been asked by a lot of cities across the country to tell our story, and try to help. But I think change is hard for humans. Change involves taking risks. When one takes a risk, you risk failure. It’s harder to try something brand new than to do what everyone else has always done. And, you know, politicians, elected officials are making these decisions. I think that’s been part of our hesitation. We have this vibrant, representative democracy, but sometimes we’re afraid to take risks because we want to get re-elected.  for years was killed off  stop signs and speed bumps  In Woodland, Washington, where the   state   Department of Transportation prefers roundabout construction, the   city   council voted to instead upgrade its signalized intersections.  one council member said  completed in the 1760’s     Görlitz, Germany  BERESFORD: It was that    with Chevy Chase — that’s so much stuck in the psychology of the Americans, that you’re just going to go ’round and ’round forever on a roundabout.  Chevy CHASE: I guess what we do is just drive around the circle here.    CHASE: Hey look, kids! There’s Big Ben and there’s Parliament!  Ellen GRISWOLD: There it is! There it is! There it is!  CHASE: I know, I can’t seem to get over to the left honey, I’ll try next time. Sorry!   Chevy CHASE: Kids!  KIDS: We know, Big Ben.  CHASE: Parliamenrt.  HECOX: I’m not a psychologist, so I won’t pretend to give you a psychological analysis of the American driving public.  HECOX: But the Europeans have been using traffic circles in one form or another for far longer at a much higher percentage of the population than the United States has.  built in 1905  HECOX: The reality of road projects in general, whether they be roundabouts or big bridges, the response to and commitment to it by the public really does vary everywhere for any number of reasons. Some members of the public balk at cost issues. Others balk at the design of it. Some balk at the timeline of it. Others balk at the potential environmental downside of construction. And so it’s hard to pinpoint why there may be resistance to roundabouts, other than it’s an inconvenience or it’s going to force me to slow down. But we think they haven’t really understood just how beneficial roundabouts can be. Once the drivers use it and actually figure out how to do it properly, their apprehension tends to go away.  in place for at least a year  McBRIDE: I think one of the other complicating factors is that in the United States we have the most established set of transportation design guidelines compared to other countries.  McBRIDE: That’s good for the most part. But what it does is it trains our driving population to rely on the transportation system to instruct them at every move. And it causes them to put a lot of trust, whether deserved or undeserved, in the technology that’s built into our transportation system. A roundabout is a deviation from that. Because now I have to think for myself. A yield sign at every entry at a roundabout requires that a driver has to come to that yield sign and think for themself: “Am I allowed to go? Am I not allowed to go?” So it’s uncomfortable for a driver that wants to be instructed.   CAMERON: A roundabout really does stretch the — how to phrase this — it’s almost like the processing power of the human brain.  Oliver Cameron  CAMERON: I’m the co-founder and C.E.O. of Voyage.  CAMERON: What you’re doing is having to do this intricate dance almost, with all of these other people. You’re basically taking social cues from all of these different vehicles and you’re doing that visually.   CAMERON: In a robo-taxi, that same challenge is present. You have to be able to perceive these objects early.  CAMERON: You have to be able to understand their intent, understand their direction, their speed. And all of these things make for a particularly interesting challenge.   And a robo-taxi is not quite as aggressive as a human driver. So it’s very conservative.    CAMERON: You cannot be conservative. It just doesn’t work. You’d be stuck there at the entrance to a roundabout forever.    CHASE: Kids.  KIDS: We know, Big Ben.  CHASE: Parliament.  CAMERON: The way we think about roundabouts is, it is a negotiation, and that negotiation starts by detecting these objects. What is then important is to extract almost metadata from each object. Like speed, like the prediction of where that object is going to be in 5 seconds, 10 seconds. And then what you’re doing is playing forward a whole bunch of different scenarios.      CAMERON: These are algorithms we’ve been refining now for nearly four years. It’s able to handle that sort of negotiation really quite elegantly.  self-driving car from Hyundai  Elon Musk said last August  CAMERON: I think, yes, on a certain time horizon. And that’s because these vehicles don’t just learn from one situation. They learn from thousands of other situations they’re exposed to, every stress test under the sun.  CAMERON: We’re deferring control to software, then it will cause anxiety. So it will be a challenge to get public acceptance. But I have confidence that people will see the benefits, both safety and convenience benefits. And that transition won’t be as painful as perhaps other transportation changes over time.  BERESFORD: In Birmingham, where I’m from really, originally, there’s an island called Spitfire Island and that’s got the   .   And that was outside the Jaguar plant, the car plant. And it means a lot to me, because my mother worked there during the war, producing these Spitfires. So, quite sentimental over that one. And it’s the fact that anything can go on these roundabouts. They’re like blank canvases for these artists and sculptors and gardeners. In America, I mean, the sky’s the limit, isn’t it? In Detroit, you could have a car on the roundabout or a Tamla Motown Records sculpture or something. Because a lot of English roundabouts reflect what’s going on in that area, or a local artist will put some sculpture or painting. It’s where your imagination wants to go. And it puzzles me why America doesn’t embrace this idea.
