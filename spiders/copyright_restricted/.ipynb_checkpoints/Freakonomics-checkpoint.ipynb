       "   'HOSOI: If you’re flipping coins, on average a person would win half of their games in the first half and half their games in the second half. If it’s a game of, let’s say, a grandmaster in chess playing against a novice, they’ll probably win all the games.',\n",
       "   'HOSOI: So, we split it into fantasy baseball, fantasy hockey, fantasy basketball, and fantasy football. And if you’re trying to explain to, let’s say, an attorney general where fantasy sports lie on the spectrum, you have to give them something to compare it to, right? The number that we give them doesn’t mean anything on its own. So, then we compared that to real baseball, hockey, basketball, and football.',\n",

So, we said, “Look, for the meantime — and maybe for a while — the way to serve them will be fantasy sports.” But we all absolutely believed long-term that other forms of sports betting and gaming that hadn’t been legalized at this point but were very prevalent in other countries, that those would be made legal here, and it actually happened a lot faster than we thought.

Anything that the N.C.A.A. or the N.F.L. makes right now is all incidental. The way they benefit is maybe the person who takes out that bet is more likely to tune in to the game or go to the game and therefore that’s how the N.C.A.A. gets the money. Mind you, the N.B.A. and N.F.L. and other pro leagues in the United States have been trying to negotiate with states saying, “Hey, we’re the ones whose product is being bet on.

But in that time, it coaxes the cell to produce the protein that it encodes for. And so that fundamental information, if you will, is the underpinning of our technology.',\n",
       "   'ZAKS: So, what it does is it actually takes the instruction sets for part of the virus, the protein that the virus uses to attach itself to cells, and it encodes them in this messenger R.N.A., so that when we inject the vaccine into somebody’s arm, it actually causes that person’s own body to make that protein.

The first is, I know that the vaccine can generate neutralizing antibodies that are, on average, higher than what you see even with infection. And the second thing I know is that the safety and tolerability profile, so far as we’ve seen from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, is it’s pretty much what you’d expect. So, now the question is, well, what does that look like in a much larger population of tens of thousands of people? And does that immune response — that you are optimistic will prevent disease — can it indeed be shown to prevent disease?\\xa0',\n",

So, despite your optimism on the Covid-19 vaccine that Moderna is working on, why should we believe that this one will work?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ZAKS: Well, I think what we have done uniquely is leverage a decade of engineering and science on top of medicine to sort of break the riddle of how to get an m.R.N.A. to make enough protein. And the second element is, we already have proven time and again that we can generate neutralizing antibodies with this vaccine. So, the question ahead of us is not whether m.R.N.A. will work. The question ahead of us is whether neutralizing antibodies are going to prevent Covid-19. And I think the likelihood of that answer is very, very high. ',\n",

No. 2, the level of collaboration has meant that we don’t usually wait for the weeks and months that you typically wait in the drug-development cycle. I think we’re very fortunate in this country to have the F.D.A. that we do. They are working nights and weekends just like we are. ',\n",
       "   'And the last element that I think people often don’t appreciate: one of the biggest reasons that it takes so long for developing vaccines is because, remember, vaccines are treating a healthy population, trying to prevent a really uncommon event of an infection. And so typically, you go and you treat thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, and then you sit around and you wait for years for the events to accumulate. Well, in the current transmission in the United States, unfortunately, that transmission is high. And in a very paradoxical manner, the worse it is out there, the quicker we will be able to demonstrate efficacy.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'HAMBURG: Certainly, the experience with H.I.V. vaccines is a reminder that even with some of the best minds in science, and considerable investment of time and dollars, it’s a scientific challenge that has proven very, very hard to crack. It looks as though this coronavirus is probably a lot easier to make a vaccine against. But that remains to be seen.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'HAMBURG: And each of those stages is generally done in a very discrete way, where you do a stage, you sort of assess where you are, you make more vaccine so you can go on to the next stage. And that can take a very, very long time. And in this case, there’s been a real effort to compress the stages in important ways.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'So, you may be creating a manufacturing facility and preparing for a large scale-up and actually making vaccine that ultimately, will end up in the garbage. But that’s going to be important, because as soon as we have a vaccine that proves that it’s safe and effective for use, you’re going to want to be able to give it to not just hundreds of thousands of people, but literally billions of people, because this is a global pandemic.',\n",
       "   'BARDA recently awarded Moderna',\n",
       "   '$1 billion from BARDA',\n",
       "   'ZAKS: The company has been funded over the years by billions of dollars of private investment. Those billions created the opportunity for the U.S. government to come in earlier this year and say, “I’m going to add some money to the pot to make sure that you get the development for this vaccine right.” ',\n",
       "   'However, I can promise you that every one of those dollars will be accounted for. That’s not money that goes to our coffers, nor is it money that goes to our profits. That’s going to be part and parcel of our ability to manufacture and provide access to the U.S. population through what I anticipate to be central purchasing by the U.S. government, or at least I hope so.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And is that purchasing, whether it’s central or otherwise, is that guaranteed? What if the U.S. government says, “We’re going to give you guys $30 a dose,” and then let’s say Saudi Arabia or China comes and says, “You know what, Tal? I’ll go $100 a dose, and I’m going to buy double what the U.S. had committed to buy.” What happens then?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ZAKS: So, we have been very disciplined and very thoughtful back from January and February about how we do this. We’ve set a price that was reasonable and a price that allowed governments to pre-purchase access. We’ve not played any favorites. Clearly we’re domiciled in the United States. And I think the U.S. has sort of first dibs. ',\n",
       "   'But we’ve also set up a manufacturing site in Switzerland to enable sort of a neutral country for rest-of-world supply. And at that point, what we’ve said is, to the governments who are interested, basically, it’s a question of time, which is to say, if you sign up now, then I can guarantee you that the first production lot, you’ll get a cut of it. And that’s how we’ve tried to be responsible to the unmet need out there.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, Moderna has been criticized for its, “secrecy,” for not sharing its methodology and results in peer-reviewed scientific settings.

       "   'ZAKS: Look, that would have been a legitimate question in 2015, 2016. It’s not today, for the very simple reason that we’ve published dozens of scientific papers on everything from the underlying science of our technology to our effects in human beings. Now, it’s true that in the beginning, we didn’t publish much. ',\n",
       "   'And I’ll tell you a personal story. ',\n",
       "   'When I joined in 2015 and I came to one of my first executive committee meetings, I said to the team, “Okay, so we’re not publishing much.” And everybody said, “Yep.” I said, “Well, why is that?” And they looked at me, said, “Well, why do you want to publish?” And I said, “Well, so that we attract good talent.” And they looked at me and said, “Well, we got good talent.” “Okay, so that you’ll attract funding.” And they looked at me and said, “Well, we’ve got funding.” ',\n",
       "   'So, I have to think, “Okay, so why do we publish?” And the answer was for all of the above reasons — except for I.P. considerations. In the early days, it was very important to not publish so that we could get all of our patents, which is ultimately what value here is built on. Now, I will tell you this, my comeback, because it made me step back and think — I said, “Okay, let me just be clear. Every experiment we do in men, even Phase 1, even when it’s not required by regulations, we will publish. Otherwise, I’m not your chief medical officer.” And they said, “Yep, of course.” ',\n",
       "   'And then I went a step further, said, “Okay, so when we get into the clinic, we should be publishing the preclinical basis for our clinical experiment. Do you agree with that?” And everybody looked at me and said, “Yep, that makes sense. That’s got nothing to do with our I.P.” And we’ve done that. I would challenge you to find any other company who is entering Phase 3 trials today who have been as transparent about their clinical activities as we have.',\n",
       "   'LO: The comment that Moderna looks as much like an investment company as a drug company, from a financial economist’s point of view, I have to say, “Is that a bad thing?”',\n",
       "   'Andrew Lo',\n",
       "   'LO: Any biotech company — and I don’t have any particular inside information about Moderna — but any biotech company has to manage their finances properly. In the same way that you and I have to make sure that we are spending within our budget and we are saving for retirement, a company has to be equally responsible. With a biotech company, this is even more important because funding is the lifeblood of a biotech company. Without money, they can’t conduct clinical trials. They can’t do research. And so, all the progress that we see will stop if they run out of money. ',\n",
       "   'And the asset that they worked so hard to develop actually gets destroyed. ',\n",
       "   'You know, if you’ve got a parking lot and you go bankrupt — well, the parking lot gets transferred to your creditors and they’ll develop the parking lot. No big deal, no loss. But if you’re developing a drug and you go bankrupt, and all the expertise that’s involved in developing the drug go off to other areas and other pursuits, because they’ve got families to feed, the value of that asset — even though you’re close but not quite there — it’s destroyed. ',\n",
       "   'It’s like building half a bridge. A half a bridge is not half as good as a full bridge. So, based on an outsider’s perspective looking in, Moderna has managed their finances quite successfully. They have a lot of cash. Their cash is going to be used to develop not just this vaccine, but a number of other vaccines. But there is tremendous amounts of risk. If they’re successful, I hope they’ll make a lot of money. If they’re not successful, then the investors could literally lose everything.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'LO: Well, I got interested in medicine a few years ago when a number of friends and family were dealing with various kinds of cancer. And the more I looked into the situation, the more I realized that finance actually plays a pretty big role in drug development and delivery. And so, I’ve been working over the last few years on applying concepts of financial engineering — things like portfolio theory, securitization, risk management — to seeing whether or not we can actually come up with better business models for developing drugs and getting better drugs to patients faster and ultimately cheaper.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'LO: Exactly. The question is, what is a particular drug worth, and therefore, what are you willing to pay for? It’s a very difficult question because it varies. And frankly, when I started studying the economics of these different drugs, I was quite surprised that vaccines were priced so cheaply. I mean, to give you an example, for flu, it’s on the order of $10 to $20 a dose. For some of the rarer diseases, maybe it’s up to $100 a dose. That’s in the United States. In third-world countries, it tends to be much less. You can get vaccines for a few pennies a dose in certain cases. ',\n",
       "   'And it always struck me as odd because if you think about what a really effective vaccine does — what would you pay for something that basically eliminates the risk of getting a disease permanently? I would have thought you’d pay a lot. For example, if you have cancer, God forbid, if there is a cure, you would pay a lot for that cure. The typical cost of a leukemia patient for taking Gleevec is on the order of $100,000 to $150,000 a year. And yet, we’re balking at paying, I don’t know, $50 or $100 for vaccines, even though it actually will prevent you from getting the disease for a very, very long time, if not for the rest of your natural life.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, there are many firms and institutions seeking to develop a successful Covid-19 vaccine right now, obviously. Let’s assume that one or more are successful relatively soon. Fingers crossed. What can your research tell us about the most successful way to coordinate distribution, how to balance medical need with the economics? What can you tell us about who gets it, when do they get it, who pays for it, and so on?',\n",
       "   'LO: I wish I had a good answer for you but let me first start out by saying that part of the challenge of thinking about these issues is that it’s not just about the economics. The fact is that when you’re dealing with life-and-death issues like Covid-19, there are ethical issues that come into play that have nothing to do with economic considerations. Or rather, they shouldn’t have anything to do with it. ',\n",
       "   'So, I think what we can say is that it’s important to get the economics right, meaning it’s important that we get the pricing of these vaccines correct so that they provide both a reasonable rate of return to investors who have risked their capital to develop these vaccines, while at the same time making sure that there’s no price gouging going on and that ultimately we provide access to everybody. So, that’s the balance that I think we have to strike.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I hate to say it, that sounds impossible to me. I mean, your brain is obviously much larger than mine, but those sound like they are often quite competing forces.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'LO: They are. But I think we’ve been able to thread this needle in many other contexts. For example, we have drugs for cancer, for diabetes, for heart disease. And the kind of social contract that we’ve struck is that we are willing to let pharma companies and biotech companies make a lot of money, in some cases crazy amounts of money, in exchange for eventually giving society the underlying secrets of their sauce for free. ',\n",
       "   'There are companies that have made tremendous amounts of money based upon patents for certain drugs. But at some point, those patents expire. And when they do, the drugs become essentially free. That’s happened with statins, for example, that deal with heart disease. But nevertheless, because infectious diseases are a public-health issue, governments have to be involved in ways that for other drugs they don’t. ',\n",
       "   'And so, we need to be careful that while we want to give everybody access at a reasonable price, we also want to make sure that these biotech and pharma companies that have risked their investors’ capital are able to continue doing so in the future. That’s the balance that I think we have been able to strike in the past for private-sector initiatives. And for public-health initiatives, I believe that collectively we have big enough brains to figure out exactly how to thread that needle.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'ZAKS: I think of it as three elements. The first is, what do I think the value that this vaccine brings? The second is, what is my responsibility to society in the context of a pandemic, of this unheard-of crisis? And the third is, where do I objectively land up in the real world? And so let’s start with those. In terms of value, it’s pretty clear that even if you take away the value to the economy and take away the value to society and just stay with the hardcore direct health-care benefits that this vaccine is expected to prevent, you’re going to come to a very expensive price. ',\n",
       "   'Now, it’s going to be a price that none of us are going to be comfortable paying, which is where the second element comes in. Okay, this is a pandemic. I’ve got a responsibility to society. So, most of that value will go to society. I will actually end up with a small proportion of that. And then the third element for me is, okay, what makes sense. And I have to tell you, when I step back and I see that our price range and what we’ve disclosed is actually cheaper than a diagnostic test, I feel good about it, because think about it — every time you get a fever, you get sick, and you’re worried about it, you have to go get tested, you’re going to use a diagnostic test probably more than once or twice. Whereas a vaccine, you get two doses, you should be good for a while.',\n",
       "   'HAMBURG: Just because you can make a vaccine and even test it doesn’t mean that you can scale it up to the kinds of huge numbers that we’re talking about. And lots of things can go wrong in that process. It’s having all of the tools that you need to package it into the glass vials with the rubber stoppers, having the needles and the alcohol swabs to administer it, and then getting it to the people who need it.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'HAMBURG: Yeah. Well, GAVI is an organization that has now existed for several decades. It was created through a combination of philanthropy and support from a range of nations in order to provide this well-proven public-health tool of vaccines to the poorest countries of the world who otherwise might not have access.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And can you describe the incentives that COVAX gives high-income countries and whether, in this case of Covid-19, it’s going to be enough? You know, if supplies are limited, what’s to prevent a government from going outside of COVAX, even if they have contributed, and making their own deal with pharma companies and buying up supply?',\n",
       "   'HAMBURG: Well, at present, while many countries have expressed interest in supporting COVAX, the United States has not made any such commitments. It is understandable that the United States and many other nations are pursuing strategies to help ensure vaccine development and access within their own countries. But I think there is a very strong and powerful argument for why it is in the U.S. interest and in the interest of other nations to also invest in and support access to Covid-19 vaccines in countries around the world. ',\n",
       "   'This is a global pandemic. Virus and disease anywhere puts us all at risk. In addition, we just were talking about how vaccine development is an uncertain, high-risk prospect — we don’t know which vaccine strategies are going to work. So, in fact, you can argue that while you might make some big investments in companies that you’ve prioritized and vaccine candidates that you as a country believe hold the most promise, you’re better off if you diversify your portfolio.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But you must be frustrated that COVAX is not getting greater buy-in than it is, yes?',\n",

It’s like building the plane as you’re trying to fly it in gale-force winds of a pandemic vortex. But I think that this is, really, also the time to be doing it before we have clear winners and losers in the vaccine race. Because that’s when, in fact, the argument for “What’s in it for me? What’s in it for the U.S.?” in some ways is the strongest. Because it may be that there are vaccines being developed in other countries that will, in fact, cross the finish line first.',\n",

       "   'HAMBURG: Well, there’s no doubt that these positions in public-health leadership and especially, I think, the F.D.A. — you are operating at the interface of science, medicine, public health, and politics. And that can be a dangerous interface. ',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: Putting aside the supply of a Covid-19 vaccine, what about the demand? So, presumably if the F.D.A. did not approve a vaccine but somehow the White House said, “No, this is the one, let’s all take it,” presumably that would dampen the public’s appetite for a Covid vaccine. But even, let’s say, the F.D.A. approves, I’ve seen research suggesting that only half of Americans at the moment say they would take it. Can you talk about that for a moment, general appetite for vaccines? What happens if take-up rate is only, let’s say, 30 to 50 percent?',\n",
       "   'HAMBURG: Well, vaccine hesitancy has been a longstanding concern. It’s been fueled by a strong anti-vaccination movement in this country and elsewhere. But also, in the case of the current public-health crisis, there have been concerns because of the politics of the situation and the acceleration of the R&D process that’s been much discussed — people who normally are supportive of vaccines, asking questions of, “Can we really trust it? Will it be safe? And if they say it’s effective, can we really believe that?” ',\n",
       "   'And, of course, there are populations that over time, not because of the anti-vax movement, but because of other experiences, that have questioned certain kinds of medical research and medical programs.

It’s a market failure, certainly, because, after all, infectious diseases are a public-health issue and there is an element of a public-goods aspect. You don’t want people to be infected, not just for their own benefit, but you don’t want them to be infecting others. But there’s also a behavioral failure.

In other words, they don’t stockpile vaccines. And a number of organizations have pointed out that that’s probably not a good idea. We probably need to think more proactively about developing vaccines for infectious diseases that might break out in the near future.',\n",

The process of doing that, this $200 million, is actually fraught with a great deal of risk. In fact, for cancer, historically, the probability of success is about 5 percent. So, in other words, if you start out with a $200 million investment, you wait 10 or 15 years for the clinical trials to be done, and then at the end of that process, you’ve got a 5 percent chance of getting any kind of economic return.

And so that in a kind of international negotiation sense, every time we reduce a ton of CO2, we’re providing benefits for the Chinese and Indians. But every time they reduce a ton of CO2, they’re producing benefits for us.

So, G.E.P. was actually called for by leadership in China, where they recognized that even with all the success they’d had and highest G.D.P. growth rates in the world and lifting so many millions of people out of poverty more successfully than any other country has done, that actually it came at this devastating cost.\\xa0',\n",

It was traced to dramatic deforestation that had occurred over some years before in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River system, and that deforestation made downstream people much more vulnerable to devastating flooding. And the reason is that forests are like a sponge. But in 1998, the deforestation had been really extensive. The rains were much heavier than usual and that just spelled disaster and millions of people were affected. ',\n",
       "   'The total costs were estimated at a lower bound at about $35 billion. And rapidly — as China is noted for making rapid responses — the government called for all the evidence and a systematic understanding of the situation and said, “Okay, there’s only one way out of this. There’s no way we can substitute using physical infrastructure for all the flood-control services that the Yangtze River provides to hundreds of millions of people downstream. We have to restore that forest.” And they launched the biggest reforestation program that Earth has ever seen, paying about 120 million households to protect existing forest or restore forest and the payments over the past decade or so have amounted to about $150 billion.',\n",

It’s even more reason to do it, because we need to cleanse our soul. We need to have a more perfect union. Not only because it will lead to greater equity, prosperity, and perhaps defuse some of the cleavages that exist in America today between us versus them. It is the right thing to do. It is the just, moral-compass thing to do. That in and of itself should be reason to do it. ',\n",
       "   'Glenn LOURY: Let’s say $100,000, that’s a lot of money. That would make a real difference in people’s lives. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Every African-American person receiving a six-figure transfer would relieve a lot of people’s problems paying their rent. It would allow them to educate their children more effectively. They might move to different neighborhoods. They might be able to invest in their own education and personal development. They might be able to take better care of their elderly. They might be able to avail themselves of alternative education for their children than what they get from the public schools. They could retire their college debt. I mean, there’s no way around the fact that getting 100 grand is a good thing. You will not hear Glenn Loury say that that is not a good thing. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: The basic fact is that whites have more wealth than Blacks, however you measure. Now, partly that’s a consequence of history and partly that’s a consequence of ongoing dynamics. People inherit wealth from their forebears, from their parents, and so on. So, part of that is a reflection of the past, but part of it is also a reflection of what’s going on in terms of the creation of wealth. A lot of people will have created the wealth that they possess through years of effort and entrepreneurship and so on. ',\n",
       "   'Stephan DUBNER: So, if you have that complication to deal with, right, which is that it’s not all a consequence of history, how do you start thinking about the smartest ways to shave that Black-white gap in America today? ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: First of all, I would question whether or not that’s the right objective, okay? The issues that should concern us, I think, are largely issues that transcend the racial categorization. I would be thinking about people without wealth. I wouldn’t be thinking about people who are Black without wealth. There’s looking backwards and there’s looking forwards. So, we can look backward as many have done and attempt to calculate and calibrate what were the impact of redlining, of Jim Crow segregation, of slavery, of the failure to distribute 40 acres and a mule to the freedmen and so on, and we could try to do an estimate of what would wealth be but for that historical thing. ',\n",
       "   'But the other thing is looking forward. Wealth is a stock. Income is a flow. So, the stock evolves over time under influence from the flow. We can shift wealth around at a point in time. But we may not change the steady-state wealth holdings if we don’t deal with the flow. So, that’s why I want to say the creation of wealth deserves to be a part of this conversation. Because, thinking simplistically, but I think the arithmetic works out, if I don’t change the flows, I’m going to end up back in the same situation after a while, no matter what I do. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Well, I have of late been saying I’m a man without a country. I call myself a centrist. I believe in markets. I think capitalism has been a force for good in the world overall. I think that the tendency toward planning and social control is mischievous. ',\n",
       "   'grew up on the South Side of Chicago',\n",
       "   'LOURY: I was born in 1948. I can remember getting pulled over by police officers driving on the Dan Ryan Expressway as a kid 17, 18, 19 years old. And all the cops were Irish, mostly. They were belligerent. They were discriminatory. They were contemptuous. I mean, I remember the civil-rights movement and I remember that there were many people who opposed what Martin Luther King Jr. and company were trying to accomplish. You know, there were arguments about stuff that we take for granted right now. If you were to look at the statistics there’s a much bigger African-American middle class and so on. The penetration in occupations and institutions is quite different from what it had been and so on. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: I’ll just tell you one. The year is 1982. I’m in the faculty club at Harvard University. I’m a newly tenured professor of economics and John Kenneth Galbraith — the great John Kenneth Galbraith — is engaged in a conversation in the faculty club. Do you know that he extends his hand to shake without turning his head to look me in the eye? He continued his conversation and he had his hand out like this for me to shake it. And I couldn’t believe what was happening to me. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, when you hear someone use the phrase “systemic racism” — a phrase we’ve been hearing much more lately in the U.S. — your response to that phrase is what? ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: I think you’re playing with words and avoiding the hard work of trying to discover complex historical causal chains. It’s a slogan. It’s a bludgeon. You’re saying, “Be for motherhood and apple pie.” Who’s not against “systemic racism”? But if it explains everything, well, then at the end of the day, it doesn’t explain anything at all, does it? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: When you say “it dismisses the hard work of trying to understand those complex causal changes,” give me an example of what you mean by that. Give me an example of the difference between a causal explanation or mechanism and sloganeering. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Well, let’s take the issue of school discipline. Suppose we were to discover on examination that the racial disparity in the rate of kids being suspended from school disfavored African-Americans, and we were to attribute that fact to systemic racism. But in fact, what might be happening in the schools is that for a variety of complicated social and historical, economic, and political reasons, the African-American kids on average are showing up with patterns of behavior that are disproportionately disruptive and that reflects itself in their being suspended at a higher rate. ',\n",
       "   'Now, of course, it might be racism. It might be that the school discipline system is systemically biased, but it might not be. And the difference between those two states of the world where racism explains everything or where complex social and historical processes are at work is the difference between solving the problem and not solving it.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, let me ask you this. Not long ago, Glenn, ',\n",
       "   ', “I think the reason that we’re talking about reparations now is because people are out of ideas. They don’t know what to say about racial disparities other than to point a finger and then try to create a kind of political issue.” Talk to me a little bit more about that, what you think are either economic or educational or tax policy programs that you think really would work better. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Well, everything is not policy, and part of what I’m getting at there is that some of the problem has its roots in the dynamics internal to the African-American community, which we are responsible ourselves to address. And this is very difficult territory because it feels like blaming the victim to a lot of people. You know, if I observe that — take the cops and the problem that we have in the cities with order maintenance and profiling. So, this has now become kind of a trope. I mean, it’s now argued without any second thought. “You profiled me. That was racist.” I’m Black. I’ve got a Ph.D. from M.I.T. I’m a middle-class person, but I walk into a department store and I notice that the security person has his eye on me. I feel put upon. ',\n",
       "   'Now, that’s true. It happens. A police officer asked me to open my trunk when I’m stopped and I’ve got a ',\n",
       "   ' open on the front seat of a B.M.W. and I’m wearing a suit. What does he think? I’ve got a cache of drugs in my trunk? I’m offended by that. Of course, that happens. On the other hand I’m an economist and we believe in statistical decision theory as a reasonable model of how it is that uninformed individuals act under incomplete information. And one of the things that they do is they correlate unknown things with the known things and they use statistical frequencies. And the bottom line is my race is correlated with the behavior that they can’t observe. And so, they use my race’s information. ',\n",
       "   'I don’t know how you stop people from doing that. ',\n",
       "   'I think you can legislate against it. You can administer against it. But at the end of the day, there’s something very cognitively fundamental about that, and it’s something that would affect the behavior of everybody, regardless of their race. Anyway, that’s a digression by way of saying ',\n",
       "   ' are born to a woman without her husband, and if amongst African-American adolescent males, I observe a high frequency of behavioral maladaptation, of aggression, of whatever, am I entitled at all to consider the possibility that the nature of African-American family dynamics might have a role to play in the behavior problems of some male adolescents, which then reflects itself in a lot of this drama that we see between the cops and African-American men on the streets of these cities? ',\n",
       "   'I think there are issues that we African-Americans have to confront so that the underlying causal model, historical violation reflected, for example, in a wealth gap, leaves us with a contemporary problem, the remedy for which relies on public policy. That model is incomplete because the historical violation did not only deprive us of assets. It also created context within which the dynamics of social development and evolution left us with large numbers of violent young men in the cities. That’s a problem in and of itself. Read what’s going on in Chicago on a daily basis. It’s not letting white people off the hook or America off the hook for its historical crimes to observe that some of the stuff that’s holding us back is within our reach to be able to deal with and really can’t be effectively dealt with in any other way. ',\n",
       "   'The indirect argument — “I’ll solve the problem of violence on the South Side of Chicago with more social spending, with more money for the schools, with more social workers, with midnight basketball, with whatever” — I don’t think the evidence is very strong that I can get all the way to where I want to go in that way. That’s the kind of thing that I’ve been feeling the need to call to people’s attention, that we African-Americans have some responsibility for how it is that we raise our children and organize our communities and so forth. I think that should be a part of the discussion.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, if that’s the part of the discussion you want to raise, that gets me to the next level, which is how do you address that? Because it strikes me as you’re speaking that a lot of the more observable issues that people speak out against, whether it’s overt racism, whether it’s income gap, and so on — there are solutions, I’ll kind of put those in quotes, proposals for solutions that look pretty sensible and pretty mathematical. The problem you’re addressing, however, it’s harder to put it into numbers. And I appreciate that you bring up the fact that it’s difficult to even talk about in certain circles. And in fact, if you weren’t Black, you probably wouldn’t have brought up that point, am I right? ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Yeah, well, I’m not “not Black.” I am Black. Therefore, I don’t know what I would have done. But I expect that you would not have brought up that point or many others who are not Black, and I don’t blame them because nothing but grief would come of it. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, considering that you do bring up the point and that it does concern these unobservables, do you have any ideas for how to address those? ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: I do not, to be honest with you. I mean, I can gesture at some things. You know, I can talk about the role that intermediary institutions between the individual or the household and the state. So, this would be voluntary organizations, this would be churches and things of this kind. What about Big Brothers and Big Sisters? What about mentoring? You know, it’s not as if we are completely prostrate here without any capacity for self-actualization. How do we educate our children? So, this woke moment of heightened sensitivity about racism, which manifests itself as much amongst whites, I would reckon, on the left as it does amongst African-Americans, I think that bespeaks what’s actually possible. ',\n",
       "   'I think there’s a lot of room for maneuver, a lot more room for maneuver than people allow. The main thing I’m trying to say is the country is complicated and it’s variegated. And when we get into the racial-redistribution business, we really need to be careful about the business that we’re getting into. Because we are going to create precedents in our law and in our politics that may be difficult to live with. And in particular, this idea of deciding who’s a descendant of slaves entitled to benefit. Think about the West Indian immigrants. They’re Black. I’m talking about people who came from Jamaica, Barbados, and stuff. Think about the West African immigrants. They’re Black. I’m not talking about the guy that got off the boat or the plane. I’m talking about his son or his granddaughter. Now, we’re going to cut them out, you know? ',\n",
       "   'I mean, what about the mixed-parentage person — they have to identify as Black? So, now we leave it up to a subjective? This kind of thing, it is — and I don’t mean this pejoratively, I really don’t — but it smacks of a South Africa kind of classification scheme. We don’t want that in America, I would say. Not only is the 14th Amendment a problem here, believe me, it’s not only going to be Clarence Thomas who objects to this kind of business for the U.S. government. We don’t want it for our politics. We don’t want it for the health of our society, I would say. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, you want to address poverty instead of race, essentially. Is that right? ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Yeah. I mean, I address race around the margins because I don’t want to repeal the laws against discrimination. But what would it be? We’ve got 35 million or so African-Americans. And if the number is a — $50,000, $75 we’re into the trillions. We’re Social Security-magnitude social intervention if we were to go down that road. Do we in America, in the 21st Century, really want to construct a Social Security-magnitude social intervention based on race? I don’t think so. ',\n",
       "   'LOURY: I worry about the consequences for my country of the reification of racial categorization as the basis for state action.',\n",
       "   'LOURY: Well, I’m a big fan of the kind of argument about early investment in human development. I think you’ve got a lot more malleability when you’re trying to intervene at between kindergarten and 12th grade than when you try to intervene with adult populations. The evidence seems to suggest that. The estimates of the rates of return on early investment in the best programs are really quite respectable in terms of social rate of return.',\n",

In the 1960s, I was a research assistant, a young man, at the Chicago Urban League. And one of my jobs was to count up the number of policymaking positions in the corporate sector of Chicago. And I identified 4,000 policymaking positions. There wasn’t a single African-American. Fifteen years later, you couldn’t have a corporation in Chicago without significant diversity — not enough, but significant diversity — because of affirmative-action programs that were implemented as a result of the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.',\n",
       "   'ROTHSTEIN: The federal government should perhaps be buying up homes in Levittown at market rates when they come up for sale and reselling them to African-Americans at the price that they can afford, something similar to the $100,000 that their ancestors would have been able to purchase those homes for.',\n",
       "   'ROTHSTEIN: The civil-rights movement of the mid-20th century was an activist movement. But the civil-rights movement never addressed the existing segregation that had been created by unconstitutional federal, state, and local policy. We need a new civil-rights movement that’s going to pick up where that one left off. What’s missing is the political support for those policies. People are tempted to think that this is a problem of the Trump administration. It’s not the problem of the Trump administration. The Democratic Party is a coalition of low-income, minority voters and suburban white voters. On many issues, that coalition works. But when it comes to desegregating housing, those suburban white voters are — the term that’s used is NIMBYs, Not In My Back Yard.',\n",

And the shape of progress that we’re told in theory of 20th-century economic thinking, is never-ending growth. So, we start on a delicately-balanced living planet and then ask ourselves, “How do we create economies that are compatible with Earth’s capacity to regenerate resources and absorb our wastes? How do we live in harmony with that?” And that’s completely different to any macroeconomic thinking, which just presumes growth is good. ',\n",

At the micro level, I think it’s the obsession with what’s known as cost-benefit analysis by treasuries. And you can completely lose sight of the much bigger picture, the dynamics, the knock-on effects of systems that just can’t get picked up in there.

But research in ecological economics and in climate economics is quite clear that that can’t be done fast enough while we grow the economy at the same time. And the reason is because the more you grow the economy, the more energy it requires. And the more energy it requires, the more difficult it is to supply the energy with renewables.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'HICKEL: I should actually admit, I used to believe these things, too. I mean, I’ve long believed that G.D.P. growth is really essential for an economy to function and is essential for improving well-being and so on. I remember going to a talk by Paul Krugman. This is the middle of the Great Recession, and he was going on about how America needs to really stimulate an economic recovery by getting the economy growing again. And I walked out of that thinking, “Yeah, that’s exactly what we need.” And the person I was with on the way home asks “Do you think that America, being one of the richest countries in the entire world, actually needs more G.D.P.?” And at first, I was like, “Of course it does. I mean, this is essential for the way an economy runs.” ',\n",

       "   ' than the U.S., and yet ',\n",
       "   ', right? Clearly — and ecological economics has demonstrated this over and over again — past a certain point, which high-income nations have long surpassed, there’s actually no fundamental relationship between G.D.P. and human well-being. It completely breaks down. And that, I think, should be a very liberating realization, that we can achieve the heights of human flourishing and even improve the lives of people in high-income nations without needing more G.D.P. growth whatsoever.',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: So, an easy counterargument, or a common counterargument at least, would be that, well, yes, energy use tied to growth is maybe a core problem. On the other hand, I could say the technology that is a result of our capitalism produces efficiency, which theoretically would require less energy, which would theoretically in the long run, create opportunities for more growth with less energy. But only if aided by the sort of technology and innovation that is made possible by capitalism. \\xa0',\n",

It’s important to recognize that we can target the kinds of technological innovations and efficiency improvements that we want directly without growing the whole economy indiscriminately and hoping that we get the benefits that we want. So, if your goal is to create more efficient railways or more efficient solar panels, then why not invest in those objectives directly rather than growing the whole economy.',\n",

This cannot and should not be allowed or encouraged or even listened to, perhaps.” So, who hates these ideas the most? Who is going to push back the hardest?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'HICKEL: People are enemies when they misunderstand what we’re talking about. And it can be easy to misunderstand, I admit that. When people hear “degrowth,” they think that sounds like a recession. But here’s the thing, is that a recession is what happens when a growth-oriented economy stops growing. It’s a disaster. People lose their jobs. They lose their houses. Poverty rates rise, etc. “Degrowth” is calling for a shift to a fundamentally different kind of economy altogether. What I find is that people are actually really interested in this and really ready for this kind of message. ',\n",

So, you know, recognizing that economic theory was predominant — well, not even predominantly — just written by men until almost this last century, it focused on the market and the state, the spaces of monetized interaction. And it took feminist economists coming along from the 1960s and 1970s to say, “Hello, there is the household. It’s actually the core economy on which everything depends. There is the commons, where people get together and co-create goods and services they value in communities.” And wow, the last months have really highlighted the importance of that.

We don’t have huge differences in income — a bit more than we used to — but it’s there. ',\n",
       "   'I think where we’re doing bad is that the prices of our houses are far too high. The biggest worry that people in Amsterdam have is, “Can I pay my rent, or can I pay my mortgage, or actually, can I live in Amsterdam?” Because it’s so expensive. And that is such a strange thing because we calculate our G.D.P., so how wealthy the city is, by the prices of our houses. So, we say, “Okay, we have very expensive houses, so we are doing well. We’re a rich city.” But actually, we’re saying, “There’s no access for a lot of young people, but also older people because it’s far too expensive.” So, how could we say that our city is doing well? ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Yet another way in which G.D.P. is not a very useful measure sometimes, yes?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: It’s not. It’s not. It actually shows inequality.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, what is Amsterdam doing about affordability, but affordability in concert with the sustainability and ecological goals?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Well, we have to build more houses. That’s not something that we can solve, overnight. But there’s two things that we’re doing in Amsterdam. And one of the things is that when we have new development, we always say that ',\n",
       "   '. So, that’s a fixed price that maximum rents can be asked. Then 40 percent has to be middle income and only 20 percent can be free market. So, that’s how we try to keep houses affordable. But at the same time, of course, it needs to be sustainable. ',\n",
       "   'So, we have quite high standards for building companies who want to build in Amsterdam when it comes to energy use, when it comes to materials that they use, the kind of circularity that they put into their buildings. For example, you build a house for a larger family and later on there are smaller families that want to live there. So, you can easily adjust them. Or you have buildings that were built to be a school but after 20, 30 years, there will be less children in the neighborhood and you can easily adapt that building into a new one. So, you don’t have to demolish. You can just adapt it. That’s a very important circular method that we’re using. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I was surprised to see that CO2 emissions in the Netherlands aren’t much lower today than in 1990. Again, only because I perhaps wrongly think of Amsterdam and the Netherlands as pretty progressive when it comes to clean energy and pollution and so on. ',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Amsterdam has grown immensely since 1990. So, actually, the fact that we have about the same as we had in 1990 says that we already have done good. But in order to really make the breakthrough, we have to speed things up. And we can do that by windmills and by solar, but it’s not enough. One of the things that we really have to do is to look at production mechanisms or production methods that actually cost much less energy. The energy transition is not only about using green fuels instead of fossil fuels, and then it’s over. We really have to change our behavior. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Are you talking about simply less consumption? Or when you talk about different mechanisms, are you talking about a different way to produce goods, a different way to transport goods, a realignment of basically that whole supply chain and production chain?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: I think it’s both. I think we have to consume less. We have so much stuff that actually is made to be broken instead of made to last and I think most people are fed up with that. But we also have to do things differently. So, for example, for transport, how can we have much more emission-free transport or a different kind of transport? How can we, for example, use the water much more for transport than we’re using our roads? And with the Covid crisis next to the climate crisis, we see that we have to look at much shorter supply chains. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Meaning producing more locally or nationally than importing, yes, essentially?',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Yes. And much more using already existing resources instead of mining all these new raw materials, shipping them all over the world and making new things and then throw it away and then have a huge waste crisis. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: While there’s inevitably waste in what you describe, there are a lot of efficiencies in that because you’re transporting things in massive quantities. The flip side is if you were to try to manufacture more things locally or nationally, then there are inefficiencies in that because the Netherlands isn’t as good at everything as it might like to be. So, I am curious whether you feel that you’re taking steps toward a kind of “degrowth” mindset? ',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: I don’t think “degrowth” is a goal, but growth is also not a goal. So, the whole idea is much more of being a thriving city, a city that is taking well care of its inhabitants but also taking well care of its environment and taking well care of the rest of the world. Because if we ship all these products from other parts of the world, we have no clue what the labor conditions are. Well, actually, we do have a clue what the conditions are. They are very bad. It’s just quite easy to turn our heads and don’t see it. But we know that products that we use quite often are causing labor exploitation, but also pollution in other parts of the world. And we can’t pretend we don’t know because we do.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Can you give a specific example of how your plan might encourage the reuse or recycling of something like used clothing or maybe it’s even something a little bit more disgusting than that, medical waste or electronic waste? ',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: I do think a lot of people are interested in reusing or recreating or recycling things. But right now, it’s quite difficult because it’s still cheaper to dig the mines and get all the raw materials from other parts of the world to the Netherlands. That’s cheaper for a producer than to actually recycle. So, we need this incentive to make recycling and reusing and recreating much more interesting for a producer than raw mining. ',\n",
       "   'One of the things that we need to do is completely change our tax system. ',\n",
       "   'Right now, we do have low taxes on primary resources and we have very high taxes on labor. And actually, the circular economy is very labor-intensive because all this reusing, recycling, you’re taking things apart and then making new things, is very labor-intensive. And so, I do think that by showing that using things again is not only saving the earth, but it’s also creating lots of employment — which at this moment is, because of Covid, a big problem in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has an economy which is highly dependent on tourists. If the economy goes well, our economy goes well. But also, if it goes bad, it goes very bad in Amsterdam. ',\n",
       "   'So, actually, what we need to have is a much more resilient economy —\\xa0which, actually, a circular economy is much more resilient than a linear. For example, right now we are working on a new policy on data centers, because they use enormous amounts of energy. But they want to be in Amsterdam because it’s a hub. So, we said, “Okay, you can be here. But you can only use green energy. The heat water that you have as a waste product from your cooling systems — ',\n",
       "   ' in order for us to',\n",
       "   ' so we can exchange gas by this hot water that comes from the cooling systems.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Oh, so you use geothermal from the data centers. Their waste product is your heat source.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Exactly. And we also ask them to have good architecture, because quite often data centers are like black boxes somewhere.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, let me propose an unintended consequence of your well-meaning policy. Let’s say you go to these big data centers and say, “If you’re going to be here, you need to use green energy, construct better buildings, reuse your waste, etc.” And at a certain point, they say, “You know what? You are making it too expensive and difficult for us to be here. We’re going to move to a different province 50 miles away. And there, we can pollute all we want because they don’t have the Green Party in power.”',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Well, of course, that could happen. And actually, it’s something that some of the companies tell me. So, they say, “Well, do you want me to stay here? Or do you want me to go to somewhere else where I can really, really pollute?” And I say, “Do you want to be a company that really pollutes, or do you want to be part of the solution?” So, no, I don’t have all the instruments to force companies to do so. But if you want to be in a city like Amsterdam, which is an attractive city, which a lot of companies want to be because they can also provide their employees a nice work environment, a green city, a friendly city. And this is the way we do it. So, yes, we’re maybe trying to work with the coalition of the willing, but I do think the willing could be an example for others.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: You personally sound like you really appreciate the value of the carrot as opposed to the stick, or at least as many carrots as possible. I am curious: have you found industries or instances yet where you think that the stick will be much more necessary?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Oh, yes, absolutely. I do think that we have to have much higher CO2 taxes. I think we need to keep producers much more responsible for what they’re making. So, I think we should actually forbid a company to make a machine that if one little thing is broken, you have to throw it away. I think we should make it compulsory that something can be repaired — say, the right to repair instead of the right to buy. Also, in plastics, you know — quite often plastics are very hard to recycle because in just one little whatever cup, they use three different plastics, which actually cannot be taken apart in the recycling circle. So, I do think that we need to hold companies responsible for how they make their products.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, Amsterdam could go to zero carbon emissions in five years. And that doesn’t affect at all what, let’s say, India or China do. So, I realize this is not your job, per se, but I am curious to know how Amsterdam feels, being a citizen of the world, but knowing that even if you achieve your solutions across the board, not just with climate and pollution, but sustainability, housing, reusing, etc., what part that may play in the global march toward those sort of solutions.',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Well, if you only wait for the others to start, then nobody will ever move. And I know that there’s many countries in the world and many cities in the world who really want to make change, also cities within the United States of America. So, I do think as a city who puts a huge ecological footprint on the world because we are a rich city, and we use enormous amounts of fossil fuels, and we use enormous amounts of consumer goods that pollute the world by its waste, but also by the way it’s being produced, we do have a responsibility. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Let me ask you, finally: your plan is plainly dependent on social cohesion, right? People need to understand that you’re kind of all in this together. And again, as Americans, we think of Amsterdam and the Netherlands and much of Northern Europe as places where social cohesion and social trust are fairly high, certainly much higher than they are in the U.S. right now. So, I’m curious whether or how you think this kind of approach could work in the U.S., where the society is different, the economy is different, the relationship between the individual and the state is very different, and I’m curious if you have any advice for us.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'VAN DOORNINCK: Well, Amsterdam and the Netherlands and Western Europe has much more history of the welfare system, and I think Americans are much more self-reliant. And some parts of a circular economy are quite self-reliant, because with the stuff that you have, you can make yourself new things. Or your neighbor could do that, but at the same time, you could provide other services to your neighbor. ',\n",
       "   'For me, the circular economy is about thinking globally but acting locally. What would a neighborhood be like if actually you can produce your own energy and you can exchange it with others and create these small grids where you don’t need the big companies anymore, which would be a complete democratization of the energy supply? And I think it would take the entrepreneurship that a lot of Americans have on a smaller scale. I think America could do that. Maybe even better than Western Europe, because you are a people who like to take care of themselves.',\n",

       "   'TIMMER: I mean, demand collapsed, but agricultural productivity did not. And what that meant was prices just collapsed. That so totally set the mind frame for U.S. agricultural policy.',\n",
       "   'EFFLAND: That’s when we see the beginning of real price policies for agriculture.',\n",
       "   'EFFLAND: There was an idea of something called parity, which was that the price should be such that it would give farmers the same purchasing power in comparison to workers and others in the economy that they had had before World War I. And that was the guideline for what those price-support levels ought to be.',\n",

       "   'EFFLAND: These things all take place in the context of their own times. Having policies that found a way to increase farm incomes in the 1930s would be seen as a good thing. But there are also consequences of that over time as they get embedded.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: Economists who don’t do U.S. agricultural policy are usually horrified by what they see in terms of distorting markets — picking, “Okay, corn, soybeans, wheat, you guys get big subsidies. Apples, grapes, fresh fruits and vegetables, you’re on your own.” Dairy — incredibly regulated, both federally and at the state level. Just a mess, just an awful mess.',\n",
       "   'EFFLAND: So, we have controls on how much can you plant on an acre but not on how much your yield is on the acres you’re planting. There’s a huge boom — lots of new chemicals, fertilizers, machinery, that make farms more productive. So, even though we’re trying to control by reducing the acreage, there continues to be increasing production and surpluses don’t go down.',\n",
       "   'EFFLAND: Problem-solving on the scientific and technical and engineering side tends to run on its own track, and be seen as a positive outcome. I don’t think there’s ever a point at which the policy side is saying “Oh, stop providing good science and better agricultural practices so we don’t have these surpluses.” Because when you do that, what you’re saying is then, “Stop this economic development.” Solving problems and making farming more efficient are still seen as good projects to continue. The fact that they also create these surpluses is sort of a different track of problems that the farm policy then is trying to figure out solutions to.',\n",

       "   'TIMMER: High-fructose corn syrup. Yep. You’ve got surplus corn and you’ve got a demand for easy, convenient sweetener in the food sector. And that was just a perfect storm. That syrup revolutionizes food processing because instead of a powdery sweet thing, it’s a liquid, and liquids are way easier to handle in food processing. ',\n",
       "   'If I had only one thing to say about the impact of our agricultural programs on what you see in the supermarket and subsequent health issues out of the diet, I would have said the fact that we use so much high-fructose corn syrup — that’s the example of how things can go badly wrong, even if well intended. I mean, don’t get me started on ethanol, because that’s the next step in reducing the surplus. But I don’t want to go there.',\n",

Where similarly there’s been massive U.S. government investment in science and technology to support economic growth and productivity. I’m sympathetic to those who see it as overall a net positive gain. However, the pain is real.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: Supermarkets were able to manage the supply chains all the way back to farmers, but they didn’t want little tiny farmers. Just one supplier, please — it’s just way too complicated to contract with 50 or 100. That has changed then the nature of production right down at the level of Tip-Top Canning Company, and how we would be able to provide the regular quality and supply and low price that a Walmart or a Kroger or a Publix would need.',\n",
       "   'HAMILTON: I mean, Walmart really came in and looked at the landscape of American supermarkets and saw inefficiencies everywhere. What Walmart did was build on its successful model of general merchandise sales with hyper-efficient logistics and distribution — brought that into the supermarket industry and really shook things up.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: I used to ask my class, I’m talking 1985, “Where is the world’s largest supercomputer?” And the correct answer was, “It’s at the Pentagon.” Okay. “Where is the world’s second largest supercomputer?” Bentonville, Ark. Home of Walmart. They used that computer to track every single item on every single Walmart shelf. That information technology is what revolutionized food marketing. And it was pretty much invented by Walmart.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: So, the U.S. experience is formative. And it’s formative for two reasons. One: U.S. universities train so many ag. economists, food-science, food-policy people to go back to other countries that the U.S. model is pretty well ingrained intellectually. But the other thing, of course, is the biological and mechanical technologies mostly came out of the United States.',\n",

By the mid-20th century, it’s down to just a handful. Red Delicious really dominates the whole market. And apples became remarkably tasteless by the mid-20th century, so certain qualities were given up in order to gain that advantage of price and abundance.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: Well, we clearly won the food wars in terms of supply and abundance. We won the abundance war. What we may be in the process of losing is the health and quality dimensions going forward.',\n",
       "   'HAMILTON: Today we’re certainly witnessing — perhaps especially among millennials — an attempt to reconfigure values. What are you actually looking for when you go to a supermarket? It’s not just price. Price does not contain all relevant information for many shoppers in a contemporary supermarket. So, the costs — of pollution, of degraded animal welfare — that are currently not being borne by either producers or consumers of food, would have to be borne.',\n",
       "   'TIMMER: If we had worried much, much more about the quality of farm land, of sustainability, about environmental side effects from heavy fertilization on corn — we’ve got a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that is directly attributable to putting fertilizer on corn up in the Midwest. I accused my brothers of poisoning the Gulf of Mexico, and they said, “Well what are we going to do? We have to get high yields.” There was this sense of everybody being trapped in an old paradigm.

       "   'KONNIKOVA: The deeper I went into poker, the better of a metaphor for life I realized it was, and the stronger of a tool I realized it was to address so many of the psychological questions that had been percolating in my head for years. Because life is a game of incomplete information. You never know everything, and you are able to control a good amount of decisions leading up to the end because you can control how you present yourself. You can control whether or not you play. You can control how you play. But ultimately, you can’t control the cards. And I think that that’s a very good reflection of what goes on in life. There’s so much you can do, but then the ultimate outcome is not up to you. And you have to be okay with that. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: What would you say, Maria, is the luckiest thing that’s ever happened to you? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: That is the question for all questions. I think that it’s a toss-up between two things. I mean, one, it’s really difficult to call this the luckiest thing. But honestly, being born and being born to my parents and having the genetic makeup that I have, I think, is the luckiest thing that happened. But that aside, I think the luckiest thing that ever happened was the fact that when I was 4 years old, my parents decided to leave the Soviet Union and come to the United States. My life would be so different had I grown up in the Soviet Union. I have no idea what would’ve happened or what I would’ve done. ',\n",

       "   'KONNIKOVA: Yes, I think I’ve had a lot of very lucky things happen along the way. But you asked the absolute luckiest. And you have to think what really changed the trajectory of your life in the most profound way? And honestly, being a Jew in the Soviet Union — this was before the Berlin Wall fell — was no fun.

And the other thing is, I did feel like self-control was something that could be incredibly useful to me as a human, and just in general, to understand. Because it seemed to me that it was such an important thing in life to learn about emotional management, to learn about how to handle yourself. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: You write that an academic career, had you chosen that, would have been a gamble as well, which is a really interesting thought because I think a lot of people when they’re choosing their careers, there is that fundamental fork in the road of the safe or at least predictable one and then the other options. So, what would have been the risk had you chosen the academic career? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think that you are so dependent on the biases of other people because the academic job market is an incredibly biased place, as is any job market. You’re at the mercy of what types of things do the people who are in this particular place want to study? How do your theories fit into it? Even as I was going into the graduate program to study with Walter Mischel, I knew that I was entering an area that was on the outs because the hot areas were neuroscience, the hot areas were kind of all of the very hard cognition. And even at Columbia, while I was there, all of the tenure offers went to neuroscientists and there were a few amazing social psychologists who didn’t get job offers.

I was about to say a million times, but one of the things that poker taught me is to be precise. So, it’s not actually a million times. That would be an exaggeration. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: That would indeed. Let me just ask you, how numerate did you consider yourself before playing poker? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: Not at all numerate. I actually still — I know that this isn’t something to be proud of, it’s just the way my mind works — I still count on my fingers. I need that visual and tangible cue to help myself out. The last math class I took was in high school. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: When it comes to probability, however, you don’t have to learn higher-order math to understand probability, but you do need to understand probability to play poker. So, how did you grow from innumerate to a good understanding of probability?',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think it helped that I did once upon a time have a good math background. I mean, I took calculus. I was good at math in high school. I just never really liked it and dropped it soon after. So, it was just a muscle of mine that I hadn’t used at all. But as Erik Seidel, who became my coach told me very early on, ',\n",

If you make math mistakes, you’re going to lose money. And I found that as I was put in these high-pressure situations and was forced to think in that way, my mind eventually un-rusted itself.',\n",
       "   'Imagine two players at a table. The cards are dealt. Each player must look at her cards and decide whether or not the cards on their own are good enough to bet. If she wishes to play, she must at minimum “call” the big blind — that is, place as much into the pot as the highest bet that already exists. She may also choose to fold or raise. But who knows what factors she’s using to make her decision? Maybe she has a premium hand. Maybe she has a mediocre hand but thinks she can outplay her opponent and so chooses to engage anyway. Maybe she has observed that the other player views her as conservative because she doesn’t play many hands, and she’s taking advantage of that image by opening up with worse cards than normal. Or maybe she’s just bored out of her mind. Her reasoning, like her cards, is known only to her.',\n",
       "   'Each decision throws off signals, and the good player must learn to read them. It’s a constant back‐and‐forth interpretive dance: How do I react to you? How do you react to me? More often than not, it’s not the best hand that wins. It’s the best player. ',\n",

       "   'From a misplaced faith in certainty, the fact that to our minds, 99 percent, even 90 percent, basically means 100 percent — even though it doesn’t, not really. Kant offers the example of a doctor asked to make a diagnosis. The doctor reaches a verdict on the patient’s malady to the best of his knowledge — but that conclusion isn’t necessarily correct. It’s just the best he can do given the information he has and his experience in this particular area. But will he tell the patient he’s unsure? Maybe. But more likely, if his certainty reaches a specific threshold — a different one for different doctors, to be sure — he will just state his diagnosis as fact. ',\n",

       "   'DUBNER: Describe quickly for me the year 2015 for the Konnikova family. ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: It wasn’t a great year. The year started off with my mom losing her job and my grandmother dying. So, that was quite a shock because she had been healthy. She was completely self-sufficient. She was a volunteer in World War II and had survived so much during the Soviet era. And she died because she slipped in the night. She put one foot wrong. My mom had never lost her job, ever. And so, that was quite a shock that she was just let go during a private-equity acquisition. My husband lost his job. And at the same time, I had this really big health scare and it was really just horrifying. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, that was a really bad year. I’m sure the ',\n",
       "   ', with headwinds and tailwinds. Tell me, do most people believe that the good things that happen in their lives are because of their abilities and the bad things that happen in their lives are because of bad luck? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: This goes back to an idea called the locus of control. And it was the work of ',\n",
       "   '. And Rotter found that there are two types of locus of control. And by that he meant where you think control over events resides, internal and external. So, if you have an internal locus of control, when good things happen, you take credit for them and you say, “Yeah, that was me.” And an external locus of control, you say, “Oh, no, no it was events in the world. I had nothing to do with it.” Most people, he found, have an internal locus when it comes to good things. They take credit for their success. But an external locus — they — switch when things go wrong. They say, “Oh, it wasn’t my fault. Here are all of the reasons why this went wrong.” But there are exceptions. There are people who have an external locus always. That’s not good at all. There are people who have an internal locus always. That’s also not good. And the normal signature is also not great, because if you always take credit for the good things and don’t take blame for the bad things, you’re going to be overconfident. So, you need to learn how to balance the two.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: It sounds, though, as if you’ve just drawn an unsolvable puzzle. You say both extremes are poor, but also the compromise or the moderate version is poor. So, how do you optimize external vs. internal? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I think that the important thing is to have an internal locus most of the time in the sense that you understand that you do control a lot of things. But that also means keeping that internal locus for some of the bad events. But also, I think the way that you solve that puzzle is through decision-making and analysis. You actually learn that both modes of thought are possible. And so, before you jump to any conclusions, you break it apart and you say, “Okay, what was my decision process? What did I control here? What didn’t I? What was the outcome? And am I responsible for that outcome or not?” Because sometimes it will be something else and sometimes it will be you. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And pre-poker, how would you describe yourself on the internal vs. external scale? ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: I was probably someone who was more external on a lot of the good things and more internal things on a lot of the bad things. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, the good things that happened were luck and the bad things were “my fault.” ',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: Yes. I think that was a lot of the way that I thought about things I’d actually hadn’t asked myself that question until you just asked me. But now that I think about it, I think that that was a lot of my mindset pre-poker, which isn’t ideal.',\n",
       "   'There is no such thing as objective reality. Every time we experience something, we interpret it for ourselves. Do we see ourselves as victims or victors? A victim: The cards went against me. Things are being done to me, things are happening around me, and I am neither to blame nor in control. A victor: I made the correct decision. Sure, the outcome didn’t go my way, but I thought correctly under pressure. And that’s the skill I can control. ',\n",
       "   'A victim of the cruel cards? This may serve as something I think of as a luck-dampener effect: because you’re wallowing in your misfortune, you fail to see the things you could be doing to overcome it. Potential opportunities pass you by; people get tired of hearing you complain, so your social network of support and opportunities also dwindles; you don’t even attempt certain activities because you think, ',\n",

       "   'If you think of yourself instead as an almost-victor who thought correctly and did everything possible but was foiled by crap variance? No matter: you will have other opportunities, and if you keep thinking correctly, eventually it will even out. These are the seeds of resilience, of being able to overcome the bad beats that you can’t avoid and mentally position yourself to be prepared for the next time. People share things with you: if you’ve lost your job, your social network thinks of you when new jobs come up; if you’re recently divorced or separated or bereaved, and someone single who may be a good match pops up, you’re top of mind. That attitude is what I think of as a luck amplifier. Sure, you can’t actually change the cards, and the variance will be what it will be — but you will feel a whole lot happier and better adjusted while you take life’s blows, and your ready mindset will prepare you for the change in variance that will come at some point, even if that point is far in the future. ',\n",
       "   'Indeed, it’s easy to see how the bad beat seeps into everything. It’s not just complaining about the runout. It’s complaining in general. Once you do that, you slide into dangerous mental waters. ',\n",

It’s a challenging table that will force you to play well. Card-dead? No one knows that. If your face reads card-dead, everyone will walk all over you as you meekly fold.

       "   'DUBNER: So, talk about that and what it was that he was looking for, what it was that he didn’t like about those.',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: Von Neumann was drawn to poker because it was a game of incomplete information. There was a solvable component to it, but there was always an element of the unknown. And he was working at the time as a national security adviser in the United States government. He was ',\n",
       "   '. I mean, this is someone who was involved at the very highest levels of decision-making. And when he saw poker, he said, this is a good analog for that, because it’s a game of incomplete information. Chess is boring because it can be solved. There is theoretically always a correct move. And roulette is boring because it can’t be solved. It’s all chance. The house wins. You know, there’s nothing you can do. ',\n",
       "   'Poker is interesting because we can try to find a framework to develop a solution, how to think through it. And yet, it’s not solved in the sense that there are these elements of the unknown, this human element of bluffing, of representing and misrepresenting information. This is what decision-making in the real world is actually about. That was the germ of game theory. He came up with game theory as a way to try to solve poker and then ultimately shed a light onto how to make these very complex strategic decisions at the highest levels of government.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: You write about Von Neumann, he was a God-awful player by every account — poker player. So, this shook me because we think of Von Neumann as a few things: the pioneer, inventor of game theory, intersecting with the birth of computing. But if he was so bad at poker, how good could he have been at game theory?',\n",
       "   'KONNIKOVA: He was very good at game theory. He had personal failings that came out at the poker table and he didn’t care. He liked to have fun when he played poker. He liked to host poker games at his house. He liked to drink while he played. No serious poker player does this. He had a little too much gamble to him. I think that he was one of those people who wasn’t very good at applying the game theory to the actual game when it came to poker.',\n",
       "   'Poker isn’t a homogeneous game; there are multiple varieties of play, with names like Stud, Omaha, Razz, Badugi, and HORSE. Each has its own unique set of rules, but in any style of poker, the basic parameters are essentially the same: Some cards are dealt face-up, visible to all — these are the community cards — and some face-down, so that only the person to whom they are dealt can see them. You make bets based on how strong your hand is and how strong you think others’ hands are. Because the only other cards you know for sure are your own, you are in a game of incomplete information: You must make the best decision you can, given the little you know. ',\n",
       "   'But the style I’ve chosen to pursue is one particular variant of the game, which happens to be the most popular: No-Limit Texas Hold’em. How No-Limit Hold’em differs from other forms of poker is twofold. The first is in the precise amount of information that is held in common vs. in private. Each player is dealt two cards face-down: the hole cards. This is privileged information. I can try to guess what you have based on how you act, but I can’t know for sure. The only information I’ll have is your betting patterns once the public information — the cards dealt to the middle of the table, face-up — is known. ',\n",
       "   'The amount of incomplete information in Texas Hold’em creates a particularly useful balance between skill and chance. Two hole cards is just about as practical a ratio as you can have: Enough unknown to make the game a good simulation of life, but not so much that it becomes a total crapshoot.',\n",
       "   'The second thing that distinguishes this particular playing style is the concept of no-limit — Von Neumann’s own preferred style. “The power of the pure bluff is restricted in a game of limit,” explains Amarillo Slim, one of the best poker players of his day. When there’s a limit, it means that the exact amount you bet has a ceiling on it. In no-limit, you can bet everything you have, at any point. ',\n",
       "   'And that’s what makes this game a particularly strong metaphor for our daily decision-making. Because in life, there is never a limit. What’s to stop you from risking all your money, your reputation, your heart, even your life at any point you choose? Nothing. There are no rules at the end of the day, save some internal calculus that only you are privy to. And everyone around you has to know that when they make their decisions: Knowing you can go all the way, how much should they themselves invest? It’s the endless game of brinkmanship, popularized by another giant of game theory, the Nobel‐winning economist Thomas Schelling, that plays out everywhere in our lives. Who will say “I love you” first, moving “all in” in the relationship — and if you say it, will you be left out, so to speak? Who will walk away from the business negotiation? Who will wage war? The ability to go all in — and the knowledge that going all in is an option for everyone around us — is the crucial variable that makes so many decisions so very difficult.',\n",
       "   'You can emerge with the deal of a lifetime, or a life partner — or you can find yourself bankrupt or emotionally devastated. Like life, no-limit poker is high risk and high reward.

But what I can control is the time I spend now. So, why don’t I actually use it in a more productive and a better way?” Poker has actually forced me to confront that head-on in my own life. And over the last few years, I’ve cut so many toxic relationships from my life that I realized had only been a part of my life because I’d invested so much time and energy into them — friendships that I’ve had for a very, very long time that I realized weren’t friendships, that were draining me more than anything else.',\n",

Eventually, I understood that it didn’t matter who we elected. It didn’t matter the quality of the candidates. And so, once it became clear to me that it was a systems problem, I switched from investing my time in searching for the next great candidate and turned an eye to the fundamental root cause structures in the political system that pretty much guarantee that as voters we are perpetually dissatisfied.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'PORTER: Absolutely never thought of it in those terms. We always thought of politics as a public institution. That the rules were somehow codified in the rule of law and in our Constitution. But what we came to see is that politics is really about competition between largely private actors. And these actors are, at the core of it is what we call the duopoly.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: The duopoly — Republicans and Democrats.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And that competition has been sort of structured around a set of practices and rules, and in some cases, policies, that have been created over time, largely by the actors themselves. I mean, actually the founders left a lot of room in terms of how the actual plumbing would work. But it was interesting — multiple of our founders actually expressed a deep fear that parties would take over.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: In fact, John Adams said at one point, “There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader and concerting measures in opposition to each other.” And if you take a look at Washington’s farewell address, which he wrote in 1796, he talks about dangers, which could come in front of the Republic in the future. And he specifically focuses on two. One is foreign influence, and the other is partisanship. The other danger is the formation of strong parties.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Essentially they divided up an entire industry into two sides.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And we ended up seeing that it wasn’t just the parties competing. It’s that they had created influence, and in a sense captured the other actors in the industry.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: So, you have media and political consultants, and lobbyists, and candidates, and policies, all divided on to one of two sides.',\n",

       "   'PORTER: Well, it’s a great question and we have done enormous amounts of work on it. It turns out to be very difficult to get what I would call a completely definitive and comprehensive answer. We estimate that in the most recent two-year election cycle, the industry’s total revenue, was approximately $16 billion. This is not the biggest industry in the economy, but it’s substantial.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'GEHL: Generally, in industries where customers are not happy and yet the players in the industry are doing well, you’ll see a new entrant. You’ll see a new company come into business to serve those customers.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: So, in today’s world, we have the majority of voters say in polls that they would rather have an independent. So, in a normal industry, you’d have a whole new competitor coming up that was about independents to serve that unmet need.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: And yet in politics, we don’t see any new entrants other than Democrats and Republicans. So, why is that? Well, it turns out that our political parties work well together in one particular area, and that is actually colluding together over time behind the scenes to create rules and practices that essentially erect barriers to entry, ways to keep out new competition.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: So, essentially what’s happened is the parties have now sort of divided up the key inputs to political competition. And if you’re not a Republican or a Democrat, then you’re in trouble in even finding a campaign manager, much less getting the best up-to-date voter data and the best analytics and so forth.\\xa0',\n",

       "   '.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: So, each side of the duopoly — Republicans and Democrats — and the players that are playing for those teams, effectively, have over time worked to improve their own side’s fortunes. But collectively, they also have come together to improve the ability of the industry as a whole to protect itself from new competition, from third parties that could threaten either of the two sides of the duopoly.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: In this industry — because it’s a duopoly that’s protected by these huge barriers to entry — essentially what the parties have done is they’ve been very, very clever. They don’t compete head-to-head for the same voters. They’re not competing for the middle.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: It’s likely that we have a much more powerful center, a much more powerful group of moderates, than our current duopoly demonstrates. ',\n",
       "   'PORTER: What they’ve understood is, competing for the middle is a sort of destructive competition. It’s kind of a zero-sum competition. So, the parties have divided the voters and kind of, sort of ignored the ones in the middle. Because they don’t have to worry about them, because if the middle voter is unhappy, which most middle voters are today in America, what can they do?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: The only thing either party has to do to thrive, to win the next election, is to convince the public that they are just this much less hated than the one other choice that the voter has when they go to the ballot. Which means that that gives those two companies, essentially — the Democrats and the Republicans — the incentive to prioritize other customers.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And their target customer, on each side, is the special interests and the partisans. And they get a lot of resources, and a lot of campaign contributions, and massive amounts of lobbying money to try to get their support with whatever those partisan or special-interest needs are.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: There is now an entire industry of politics that moves forward, independent of whether that industry actually solves problems for the American people.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: So, what’s happened is that the moat or the barriers to getting into this industry and providing a different type of competition have been built to enormous heights, which has allowed the parties to structure the nature of the rivalry among themselves in a way that really maximizes their benefit to them as institutions, but doesn’t actually serve the public interest.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Yes.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Yes.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Yes.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Yes.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Oh, yeah.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Oh, my God.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: But the vast majority of Americans, who are somewhere in the middle, are feeling very, very disaffected.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: So, years ago we created partisan primaries in order to actually take the selection of a candidate out of this, “smoke-filled back room” and give the selection of the party candidate choice to citizens. So, that was designed to give more control to citizens. It turns out it has had a very deleterious effect on competition, and has increased the power of the parties.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: We have a chart in our report that just selects some, what we call landmark-type legislation over the last 50, 60 years. And if you go back even 20 or 30 years ago, the landmark legislation was consensus.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Now, for the last decade or two that’s been the opposite pattern. The only way landmark legislation gets passed is one party has enough votes to pass that by itself.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, your diagnosis suggests that this industry serves itself incredibly well. It suggests that it serves us, the citizenry, really poorly. And it also suggests that more competition would improve the industry, as it does in just about every industry. But, just having more competition in parties doesn’t seem to be the answer alone. I mean, there are plenty of multi-party political systems around the world that have similar cases of dysfunction and corruption and cronyism like ours. The U.K. comes to mind, Israel comes to mind. So, how direct a step — or direct a prescription — would that be?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Well, I think in our system in particular, where we have only two, and they have been able, through the set of choices we’ve described, to actually set up the rules of competition that reinforce their partisan competition, dividing voters and so forth — more competition, I think, would be incredibly valuable. But it has to be a different kind of competition. You know, it can’t be just another party that’s going to split our electorate into three partisan groups. ',\n",
       "   'And so in our work, we focus on what would it take to make the competition less about dividing the voters, and how can we make the competition more around building up more choices for voters that were more about solutions? By the way, let me be clear: we’re not against parties per se. What we are against is the nature of the competition that our existing dominant parties have created.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Let me ask you this: when you suggest that these rules were carefully constructed, I guess if I were thinking about something other than politics, the first thought that would come to mind then is, well, collusion, right? If I can be one member of a duopoly, I actually hate my rival much less than I hate the idea of anybody else who would interrupt that rivalry, because we are splitting the spoils now. Do you have any evidence of collusion between the parties to create a system that essentially keeps the rest out?',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Well, first of all, that is the right word. It is collusion. And you know, there’s probably a legal definition of collusion, which I don’t know. You know, I’m not a lawyer. But the effect is exactly the same: the parties have agreed on a set of rules that benefit the duopoly and preserve this nature of competition. You can really put rules into a number of buckets. There’s kind of legislative machinery as we call it, which is how the Senate and the Congress are run. And then there is the election rules, having to do with what is the primary process like, and what does it take to get on the ballot as an independent. And the various campaign finance stuff that surrounds elections. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Has anyone ever considered filing — whether in earnest or not — an antitrust suit against Republicans and Democrats?\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: You know, Stephen, that’s a great question. You know, I have. We’ve actually had a significant effort to see if that’s feasible. You know, what the law is looking at the antitrust statutes. But this is absolutely what antitrust policy is all about. It’s creating open, effective competition that serves the customer and the public interest. And this industry cries out for that. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: All right, so in the report you discuss the many advantages the two parties have. And I think we all recognize that there’s real power in size and there’s leverage, especially when you’re making your own rules for your own industry. And you write that they use those advantages to retain control and to constrict competition and so on. But it strikes me that Donald Trump really got around a lot of those advantages. ',\n",
       "   'You write that the parties “control the inputs to modern campaigning and governing.” But he didn’t rely on that, really. You wrote that the parties co-opt channels for reaching voters. But he kind of co-opted or maybe took advantage of his own channels, including free media and his own social media accounts. You write that the parties, “erect high and rising barriers to new competition,” But in the case of Trump, his own party tried as hard as they could to erect the highest barrier and couldn’t keep him out. ',\n",
       "   'And so, on those fronts, it would strike me that the parties failed, failed to constrict a certain competitor. ',\n",
       "   'So, I don’t know how you personally feel about President Trump, but according to those advantages and his end run around them, it would sound as though he is at least one example of the solution to the problems that you’re describing.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Well yeah, I think that is definitely a good question and we must take that on. I would say a couple of things. First of all, the best choice that President Trump made was to run in a party.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: He had to pick one side of the duopoly, because he knew he couldn’t win as an independent. And he had actually explored running as an independent in previous years, but that in the current system is not seen to be a winning strategy.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: The other thing I would say about him was that he had resources. In the end, he didn’t have to use that many of them. But in a sense, he could almost have self-financed, and he was appealing to a certain subset of the partisans — maybe a somewhat-neglected subset of the people on the right. And he had a very strong existing brand identity. So, he was able to get a lot of recognition and coverage without having to spend that much on advertising.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: He represents a personality-driven campaign within a party, but we don’t believe that he represents fundamentally transforming the structure of competition in the industry.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: But the real thing that I think everybody has to understand is that in modern politics, the parties are more powerful than the president. And Donald Trump has gotten very little done. He’s achieved no compromise. And his signature success got zero Democratic votes. And the game hasn’t changed. ',\n",
       "   'So far, Trump is just the third in a row of presidents that may have said that he was going to do things differently and cut across lines and all that kind of stuff. But frankly, he didn’t. Obama didn’t, and President Bush didn’t. Even though President Obama and President Bush campaigned on bi-partisanship and bringing people together, they failed. So, I think that those recent case studies are sobering.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'have gotten weaker over time',\n",
       "   'GEHL: It’s true that the parties are not as strong as they were in the past. But both sides of the political-industrial complex, Democrats and Republicans, are as strong as ever. It’s just that the power may not all reside within the party.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And if parties were stronger, that doesn’t mean they’d be moderating forces. That’s what some people say. I really don’t understand that argument. The stronger they are, the less moderating they’re going to be, given the nature of the competition that’s been created.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: And I think we are really asking for too little when we say, “Let’s tinker around the edges and get stronger parties so that we can have a little bit of a cleaner process.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Instead, what we believe is, we need to create structural reforms that would actually better align the election process and the legislative process with the needs of the average citizen.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: All right, so you’ve diagnosed the problem in a really interesting and profound way, by overlaying a template that’s more commonly applied to firms, to the political industry. And of course, it theoretically leads to a different set of solutions than we’ve typically been hearing. ',\n",
       "   'So, then you discuss four major solutions. Let’s go through them point by point. No. 1, you talk about restructuring the election process itself. Give me some really concrete examples of what that would look like. And I’d also love to hear whether you do see some evidence of these examples happening, because it does seem there has been some election reform in states and regions around the country.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Yes, well when we think about reform, we have to think about really two questions. No. 1, is a reform powerful? Will it actually change the competition? And a lot of what people are proposing now is actually not going to make much difference. So, term limits are a great example.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: We aren’t fans of term limits, because we think that without changing the root-cause incentives, you’ll actually just have different faces playing the same game.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: So, No. 1 is we have to re-engineer the election processes, the election machinery. \\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: And there are three electoral reforms that are important, we call it the the election trifecta. ',\n",
       "   'PORTER: The the election trifecta. And the first and probably the single most powerful is to move to non-partisan, single-ballot primaries.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Currently, if you’re going to vote in the primary, you show up and you get a Democratic ballot or a Republican ballot. And then you vote for who’s going to represent that party in the general election.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And the one that’s on the farthest left or the one that’s on the farthest right has a tendency to win. Because the people that turn out for primaries are a relatively small fraction of even the party. And those are the people that show up, because they’re really partisans and they really have special interests, and they really, really care about getting somebody on the ballot that’s for them. ',\n",
       "   'GEHL: In a single-ballot, non-',\n",
       "   'partisan primary, all the candidates for any office, no matter what party they’re in, are on the same ballot. And we propose that the top four vote-getters advance out of that primary to the general election.',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And the reason a single primary where everybody’s in it is so important is that if you want to win, you want to appeal to as many voters as you can. Hopefully more people will vote in the primary. And therefore you’re going get people that are not just trying to appeal to their particular extreme.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Here’s how ranked-choice voting works. You’ll now have four candidates that made it out of the top four primary. Those four candidates will all be listed on the general election ballot, and you come and vote for them in order of preference. So, it’s easy,“This is my first choice. This candidate is my second choice. This is my third choice. This is my fourth choice.” When the votes are tabulated, if no candidate has received over 50 percent, then whoever came in last is dropped, and votes for that candidate are then reallocated to those voters’ second choice, and the count is run again until one candidate reaches over 50 percent.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And what that does is it gives a candidate a need to appeal to a broader group of voters.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: And very importantly, it eliminates one of the hugest barriers to competition in the existing system — and that is the spoiler argument. So, what happens currently is that if there’s an attractive third-party candidate, or an independent candidate, both Democrats and Republicans will make the argument that nobody should vote for them because they will simply draw votes away from a Democrat, or draw votes away from a Republican, and therefore spoil the election for one of the duopoly candidates. Once you have ranked-choice voting, everybody can pick whoever they want as their first choice, second choice, third choice. No vote is wasted and no vote spoils the election for another candidate.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: And then the last part of the trifecta is non-partisan redistricting. Gerrymandering has to go.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Essentially, when parties control drawing the districts, they can draw districts that will be more likely to tilt in favor of their party. And they can end up having a disproportionate number of\\xa0 “safe” Republican seats or safe Democratic seats by the way that they draw the districts, and we want to make that go away.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: So, Congress makes its own rules for how it functions, and over time, these rules, customs, and practices have been set in place to give an enormous amount of power to the party that controls the chamber.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: But what’s happened to it — and this is sort of collusion in a way — is, when the other party takes over, they do it the same way, pretty much.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: So, we propose moving away from partisan control of the day-to-day legislating in Congress. And also, of course, in state legislatures as well.',\n",
       "   'GEHL: Where we differ with so many people championing these reforms is that we don’t believe that money in politics is the core issue.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Ultimately, the problem is really this nature of competition that leads to this partisanship. And that’s not a money issue per se, that’s a structural issue.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: If you take money out of politics without changing the rules of the game, you’ll simply make it cheaper for those using the existing system to get the self-interested results that they want without changing the incentives to actually deliver solutions for the American people. Having said that, we do believe that there are benefits to increasing the power of smaller donors. And so the reforms that we have suggested are primarily focused on increasing the power of smaller donors.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Ten Ideas to Make Politics Less Rotten',\n",
       "   'PORTER: It is definitely challenging. This is a ground game. We’re not going to be able to do this in a year or one election cycle because the resources that the current duopoly have to deploy, to play their game, are substantial.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Despite the rather depressing — or at least sobering — picture that you paint of the political industry, throughout the report, you express quite a bit of optimism. And I want to know why, or how, because I don’t see the avenue for optimism. \\xa0',\n",
       "   'PORTER: Well, I do think we have a basic optimism. We have no sense that it will be easy to change the rules of this game, for a whole variety of reasons. But the good news is we’ve had some progress. We’ve got some non-partisan primary states now, including California. You know, we’ve got ranked-choice voting in Maine. I think what seems to be building in America is a growing appetite and a growing recognition that this isn’t working for our country. And I think the younger generation, you know, millennials are particularly outraged and concerned and open to all kinds of new ideas. But I think it’s going to take time.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'GEHL: The most exciting strategy in this area that we champion is a strategy put forth by the Centrist Project — and full disclosure, I’m on the board of the Centrist Project, it’s now actually called ',\n",
       "   ' — and this is the Senate Fulcrum Strategy. So, here’s the idea. Let’s elect five centrist, problem-solving-oriented U.S. senators who, at that number, five, would likely deny either party an outright majority in the Senate, which would make those five senators the most powerful single coalition in Washington, D.C., able to serve as a bridge between the two parties, or to align with one party or the other depending on the issue, in order to move forward very difficult policy solutions, where previously there has not been the political will. So, we don’t need to wait to change the actual rules of the game to deliver politicians to office who can act independently of the existing political-industrial complex.',\n",

       "   'Stephen DUBNER: So, what’s it feel like, as an economic historian, to be living through a moment that’s plainly historic from an economic perspective? ',\n",
       "   'Christina ROMER: It is sort of mind-blowing. I remember back from the 2008 recession, I said to myself, “Well, I never thought in my life I’d live through a bank run.” And here were, people lining up outside banks. Now I’m living through a pandemic. It is just really hard to fathom.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I’m a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: And several months later, I was talking to Rahm Emanuel, the president’s chief of staff, and I said, “By the way, can you just tell me why I got this job?” And he said, “You’re an expert on the Great Depression. And we thought we might need one.”',\n",
       "   ' A new report out today estimates that in the first quarter this year, the G.D.P. shrank by 4.8 percent.',\n",

       "   ': This is way worse than anything we saw in the Great Depression. ',\n",
       "   'Freakonomics Radio',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I still feel we should have done even more. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: It is the single biggest thing that needs to be done very quickly. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I mean, the history of this country is rising to challenges.',\n",
       "   'causes and consequences of economic downturns',\n",
       "   'ROMER: For an economist, there’s almost nothing that matters as much in people’s lives as whether they have a job, whether they can support their families. I think it probably doesn’t hurt that I came of age — I was in graduate school during the Volcker Recession of the early 1980s, and I think that was a searing experience for me and really made it stand out in my life.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: My mother was the most frugal person you could imagine. I can remember when my father — they were buying a house that was a little bit of a stretch — and I can remember finding my father sitting up one night just in a sweat over whether he should take on this mortgage. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: If we were having this conversation at the start of 2020 — with record-low unemployment, record-high stock markets, a generally robust economy — if we were having this conversation back then and I said, “Uh, Professor Romer, I believe that real G.D.P. in the U.S. will fall something on the order of 5 to 6 percent in 2020,” you would have said what to me?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: “You’re out of your mind.” I can even remember having been on a phone call with one of the advisory boards that I’m on after the pandemic had started, but it was really early. And someone said, “I think the unemployment rate’s going to go to 11 percent.” And even then, I said, “Oh, for heaven’s sakes, this is not the Great Recession. It’s going to be a dislocation. It’s going to cause problems. But how do you get to 11 percent?” ',\n",
       "   'harder than usual',\n",
       "   'the true unemployment rate',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I mean, it always has some problems with it. There’s some particular problems because we’re asking questions that we don’t normally have to ask, like, “Are you employed but staying home because you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus?” That’s not a question that was ever on the survey before. And so, there are certainly some problems just with, how do we code those things? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I thought in late November of 2008, “Wow, we’re headed for a terrible downturn, maybe the unemployment rate will go up three or four percentage points.” And then the numbers start to come in and it’s hitting you, just, my heavens, how horrible this thing is. ',\n",
       "   'Both the private forecasters, those of us in government, everybody was having to readjust and say, “Wow, this is really bad. Oh, my goodness, it’s worse than really bad.” And I’m sure that the people in the Treasury and the Council of Economic Advisers today are having those same kinds of moments of, “Holy hell, I didn’t know it could get this bad.”',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, I guess the big question really is how worried are you right now about the near- and long-term future of the U.S. economy? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: That’s the million-dollar question. I am, of course, deeply worried about the near-term outlook, and what we’re living through right now is truly wretched. And there aren’t bad enough words to describe just how much many people are suffering. We’ve had a cataclysmic decline in output. ',\n",
       "   'A cataclysmic fall in employment.',\n",
       "   'I think what worries me a lot is, I think some people think, “Oh, we’re starting to end the lockdowns, we’ll snap right back.” And that, unfortunately, is not going to happen. And I think people maybe aren’t prepared for the fact that this is going to be a long, hard slog. And so the pain we may have for not just a few more months, but a few more years, is something that concerns me greatly. ',\n",
       "   'Covid-19 diagnoses',\n",
       "   'rising fast in many places',\n",
       "   'ROMER: This may cause a much more permanent change in how we live and how we do things. And so we have to shut down some industries and there’s going to be some new industries that grow up. And then even for some of the same industries that we still want — the restaurants, the services — if those businesses have gone out of business, then somebody else has to come in, figure out how to do it, hire the workers, build the customer base. And that’s going to take time. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: So, we don’t have quarterly data for the Great Depression. But the numbers for the first few years of the 1930s was real G.D.P. fell at about 10 percent a year. And from the peak to the trough of the Great Depression, real G.D.P. declined by about 30 percent. So, we ',\n",
       "   '. And when the numbers come out for the second quarter of this year, we’re likely to learn that it’s fallen by about 40 percent at an annual rate. ',\n",
       "   'So, when we talk about a 40 percent annual rate, it means, if we had the same behavior in the second quarter and in the next three quarters, G.D.P. would be down 40 percent. And nobody expects that to happen. I was just looking at some numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, and they think when the dust is all settled, we’ll probably say that G.D.P. fell about ',\n",
       "   ' over all of 2020. ',\n",
       "   'So, again, that’s horrible. But when you compare it back to the Great Depression, where it was 10 percent a year, and where it didn’t happen just one year but three years, it does at least help you to realize what our grandparents lived through back in the 1930s dwarfs even what is truly a horrible time now. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The first thing to say is, we still had a quite severe recession. And so in that sense, nobody should take a victory lap because it was really painful for lots of people. I think the one piece of the Recovery Act that has been now studied in hindsight is the aid to state and local governments. For an economist, it’s a great example, because some of the state and local fiscal relief in the Recovery Act was actually given more based just on historical accident. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: And so it gave us a nice natural experiment. We can see if states that got more fiscal relief for relatively exogenous reasons did better. And the answer was, they did. It was only about $130, $140 billion — I know, “only” — but it seemed to have been very effective. ',\n",
       "   'helped increase',\n",
       "   'states and municipalities',\n",
       "   'were slower to recover',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Absolutely. Before Roosevelt came in, the states were the main ones doing relief and then as soon as Roosevelt started to have some of his public works and things like that, one of things we see is states saying, “Oh, thank heavens, now we can get our fiscal house in order.” As we were designing the Recovery Act, I was one of the big proponents of, “We’ve got to make sure that state and local governments don’t start laying off public workers and cutting a lot of the crucial services, because that’s just going to make this so much worse.” ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: State governments are something like ',\n",
       "   '. ',\n",
       "   'laws requiring at least the proposal',\n",
       "   'balanced budget',\n",
       "   'ROMER: And because they’re not allowed to run budget deficits, they’re going ',\n",
       "   ' spending, cutting social programs, cutting infrastructure. And that’s going to be the real test of bipartisanship, because Democrats tend to be proponents of giving money to ',\n",
       "   '. And Republicans often are not. And that will be the real test, if we can get that through because it is the ',\n",
       "   ' that needs to be done very quickly. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: If you are running one of these states that’s taking on massive debt now dealing with Covid, would you try to undo this balanced-budget requirement and run in a deficit? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: That’s a great question. I think the much better thing is probably for states to stay the way they are, and for the federal government to use its power to borrow to help the states. Simply because we are one country, and especially something like Covid doesn’t affect every place the same. But it seems like the natural thing that we all share in those burdens. You don’t say, “Oh, well, you’re a state that happened to get unlucky, so you’re just going to have to pay for it, right?” A benefit of being in a large country is that we have insurance. We take care of one another — when there’s a hurricane in Florida, the rest of the country helps them. When there is a terrible Covid outbreak in New York City, I think the rest of the country should help them.',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. But the fact is that a lot of these states that are in real trouble, they claim that they’re not getting anywhere near the federal money that they need. So, relying on the old model may be catastrophic. What do you think will happen there? And let me include the question that’s a matter of some discussion and controversy, about bankruptcy for states, and whether it should perhaps be permitted. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Just as I think it’s a terrible thing for anyone to talk about the federal government defaulting on its debt — I think we’re a country where we pay our debt. So, I think letting states go bankrupt, that’s just not a sensible strategy. We ought to actually deal with the problems that we have. We’re a rich country. We can do this. And we don’t have to act like a country that doesn’t have effective government. ',\n",
       "   'What should be happening to a state that is in real trouble? I think it would certainly be much better for them to find a way to borrow than to not serve their people, to not deal with the public-health crisis. So, I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope that we can have sensible federal fiscal policy to help the states that are in real trouble. But barring that, finding a way to allow them to borrow, I think, would be a much better strategy. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I still feel we should have done even more. But I do feel good that I bargained people up by several hundred billion. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, talk about that for a minute. We’ve read about your participation as a member of this team — which included, among others, Larry Summers, who’s, I think, sometimes misunderstood in whether his aggression is intellectual or personal or whatnot. But you wanted the aid to be how much bigger than it ended up being, and how much more did you get than was originally proposed?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The main thing that I remember actually was a meeting where Larry turned out to be a crucial second vote for my opinion. So, I think the proposals had been for numbers closer to doing a fiscal stimulus of about $600 billion. And I remember having run lots of numbers. I came in and I said, “This is much too small. I think it needs to be, at least $800 billion and probably bigger.” And I almost fell off my seat when Larry said, “I agree with Christy.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Why were you so surprised he agreed?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Well, because Larry doesn’t agree with anyone. But so, it was really important for, as I said, it’s not nearly as big as it needed to be, but it was a lot bigger than anyone had been thinking. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Now, was your desire to have the fiscal stimulus be larger then, was that a result of your understanding of the Great Depression and the way that fiscal aid was used back then, and that it essentially was not large enough? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Absolutely. There are two things that I think I learned from the Depression. One was, relative to the size of the unemployment problem in the early 1930s, what Roosevelt did was much too small. It was big relative to anything that been done in the past. But it was not nearly enough to deal with the problem. I think the other thing is, actually, monetary policy can be very effective even when interest rates are quite low. And so, though what the Federal Reserve was doing wasn’t the bailiwick of the administration, one of the things that several of us tried to convey to the president is, what the Fed is doing is a great thing. You want to be supporting ',\n",
       "   '. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: What specifically was Bernanke doing that you thought was positive that needed encouragement? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Things like — when interest rates get to zero, one of the tools that you still have is to try to affect people’s expectations of inflation, because that affects what the real cost of borrowing is. And so, I think Bernanke was taking a number of steps. For example, at this time, they started giving out something that’s close to a target for what they were aiming for, for the inflation rate. ',\n",
       "   'And I remember trying to explain that that was probably a good thing, because we were in a world where with unemployment at 10 percent, people might be starting to expect inflation to come down. And if the Fed is signaling, “No, we’re going to keep it at least at 2 percent,” that can actually be very positive. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, the political costs of the recession, and your — the Obama White House’s — response to it were pretty extreme, whether it was the recovery plan itself or just the depth of the recession. The Dems got crushed in those midterms two years after Obama’s election. Surely the Trump administration is looking back at that to judge how they want their responses to affect the next election. How do you think that will influence what they ultimately decide? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I mean, I pray it doesn’t affect what they decide. What everybody should be doing is, what’s right for the country. And so this is a case where you would think that both their political interest and what the country needs would be, “Let’s deal with the public-health crisis. Let’s make sure there is enough support for workers, that there’s support for state and local governments.” So, I’m hoping that this is a time when there’s no conflict between the politics and what would be right to do. We’ll have to see. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Traditionally, the American economy has been — how I do want to say — more vibrant, more dynamic. So, if you want to compare us to Europe, we have more flexible labor markets, it’s easier to start a business here. It’s easier to close down a business here. And that has often served us very well, because capitalism is good at some things, and especially at figuring out what consumers want. But it does mean that it makes an economy much harder on workers — it’s a lot easier to lay people off, you don’t have the same employment protections. ',\n",
       "   'It certainly has been very hard on workers in this downturn compared, say, to a lot of European countries where the governments have just been paying employers to keep people on the books. ',\n",
       "   'So, one thing I could imagine is, we’ve discussed that some industries may never come back. Brick-and-mortar retail, it may come back some, but it’ll never be like it was. And I think the positive would be that the U.S. economy may be better at adjusting to such changes. ',\n",
       "   'That we are a dynamic economy. And so when there’s an opportunity, American firms are pretty quick to step in. But if you’re going to be a dynamic economy, you also need to think about, “How do you protect the people that may be harmed by all of that dynamism and don’t move as easily from one industry to another.” And we have to have a way to protect them and make sure that they’re able to keep body and soul together and retrain for whatever new jobs are coming down the line.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: There are a couple. We had the Making Work Pay tax credit. We thought, rather than write people checks and have them arrive in their mailbox or in their account, we would just slip it in. So, it’s just going to show up in lower withholding. And we thought people would just notice they had more money in their bank account and maybe that would have a good effect on spending. ',\n",
       "   'As it turned out, most people didn’t seem to even know they got it. Or worse yet, they thought the Obama administration had raised their taxes, which they hadn’t. We’d cut them by a lot. So, that was one that just didn’t work as we’d anticipated. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And was that a communication failure? A perception failure? How did that happen? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think some of it was a communication failure. I think some of it — it turns out economic theory doesn’t give us good insight. It’s really, in some sense, a behavioral question. Do people respond more if they see the check in their hands or do they respond more if it just shows up in their paycheck a little bit every month? And I think it was partly, we’re just learning.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: We were trying a lot, especially in 2010, to think of another fiscal stimulus that maybe would not be terribly expensive, but could have a big bang for the buck. So, we were very interested in a new hiring-tax credit, a way to convince businesses to hire workers. And, we really did due diligence on this one. We ran surveys and we spun the C.P.S. tapes.',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Just all of research we could think of, we were just desperate to get them over the hump and ready to hire again. We ended up getting a small pilot program through Congress, but nothing on a big scale. So, I’m not sure that we ever learned whether this wouldn’t work. But that was a policy that I was very excited about. Maybe that’s still something we could have in our arsenal and try at some point. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Because, what Roosevelt was able to do, of putting just millions of people directly on the government payroll, I think, was incredibly valuable. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: This is the W.P.A.—',\n",
       "   'ROMER: W.P.A., the Civilian Conservation Corps. But in a modern world, trying to figure out how to hire millions of people quickly is something that seems really hard. And I think it’s something President Obama would have liked to do. And we thought about it. We tried. I remember having a conversation with some other cabinet secretaries. I’d say, “If money was no object, how many people could you hire?” They’d say, “Oh, lots. You know, 20- 30,000.” Like, that’s not going to do much when we’ve got millions and millions of people unemployed. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Why is it so hard? I mean, I realize you’re talking about the federal government hiring people vs. private firms, but you have been extolling the virtues of our nimble and robust capitalism, which can move fast, break things, hire and fire lots and lots of people. Why is it so hard for the federal government to do that? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think partly we have different standards for the federal government, so I think we try to do things probably more carefully. Think about the Civilian Conservation Corps. So, that’s the hiring program from the Depression that, built a lot of the buildings in our national parks and things like that. It hired mainly young men. It took them out into the woods to build roads and log cabins. ',\n",
       "   'And it sent three-quarters of their paychecks home to their mothers. And it was, by all accounts, incredibly successful. And, I’ve met with some of these people that were on C.C.C. projects. They’re now in their 80s and 90s, and it was life-transforming. But can you imagine proposing that today of, “Let’s hire young men, send them out to the woods and send their checks home to their parents?” That just, I think, is not in the modern American way of doing things. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. But there are certainly modern equivalents. For instance, one problem with disbursing aid money has been that it needs a lot of manpower. One problem with contact tracing is it needs a lot of manpower. So, is it really so hard to imagine the massive shift from private to public hiring over the next couple of years? Because this is not going to go away. ',\n",
       "   'Unemployment is not going, I assume, back to 3, 4, 5 percent anytime at all soon, right? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: No, I agree. And so contact tracing is a great example. That is something that we ought to be able to use lots of people and put them to use very, very fruitfully. I think even if you were to think about reasonable numbers, I suspect that you’re not going to be able to deal with the millions and millions of people that are currently unemployed. I’ll give you another example of — one of the ideas I was thinking about back in 2009 was, how about just a massive program of hiring people to be teachers’ aides? And I was really very taken with this, because so many of our public-works jobs tend to be for construction workers, male-, often, oriented jobs. ',\n",
       "   'And I thought this was a great way to make sure that we were getting some balance and something that might be particularly good for female employment in a tough time. And we ran into a certain amount of opposition from, you know, think about local school districts that are laying off teachers. And you say, “But I have this great program. I’m going to give you all these teachers’ aides.” They tended to say, “What we really need is the money so we can keep our teachers employed.” So, it is hard to figure out what’s the right way to do this. And I came away thinking, “Well, let’s give more money to state and local governments so they’re not laying off teachers and maybe they could hire the teachers’ aides.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay. So, if you are running some kind of economic SWAT team right now, let’s imagine you were running C.E.A. now or National Economic Council or something to the equivalent, and you were trying to game-plan the current recession or economic doldrums. Do you look more to the Great Recession as the model, whether because it’s more equivalent in some ways and/or just because it’s more recent? Or do you look more toward the Great Depression? Where are trying to draw your best inspiration from, both in terms of positive moves and mistakes to be avoided? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I almost think we need to not look at either of them. In both those episodes, or basically any other recession, the only problem is a lack of demand. And so, just any policy you take gets demand up. This is so different because it’s a public-health crisis. And you are not going to get demand up until you solve the public-health crisis, nor do you want to because you don’t want every business producing at full capacity, because then you have more workers than you can actually keep safe. ',\n",
       "   'I think we really need to throw away some of our previous experience and focus more on what’s unique about a pandemic and how do we actually deal with the public-health problem. I think I would go much less, let’s just get demand up, let’s just give people tax cuts. And much more, let’s spend so that we solve the public-health crisis. I’d maybe, take inspiration from other countries today that have made more progress than we have, rather than looking back at previous U.S. recessions. ',\n",
       "   'We talked earlier about, there is a dynamism to capitalism and especially a dynamism to the way Americans do things. But there is a cost, which is, because we’re laying off a lot of workers, the firm-employee link is being broken and they’re hard to get back. And it is hard to hire workers and get those right matches again. And so that’s going to be costly and that may tend to slow us down in the recovery process. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: There’s also the issue — I’ve heard this from several employers, mostly small- and medium-sized firms — that even if they survived Covid pretty well or are now returning to business, that they are having a really hard time rehiring their own former employees because the unemployment insurance and the other aid that people have been getting is really great and they can literally earn as much, if not more, by not going to work. I know this was an early concern when the CARES Act was being put together. It was largely dismissed as saying, “Hey, it’s much better to support individuals, if this is the downside, we’ll live with it.” But now, there are employers who are living with it. What are your thoughts on that? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think absolutely in the initial stages, it was great to get more money into the hands of people who were struggling, and we do as a country have a terrible inequality problem. So giving $600 more a week in benefits to a low-wage worker, that really was a great thing to do. I think as the economy recovers and you want people to go back to work, you don’t want them to just lose those funds to be worse off if they go back to work. ',\n",
       "   'So can you give some benefits — people have been talking about, re-employment bonuses or things like that. I think it also comes back to, we’ve got a long-run inequality problem. We should be dealing with that. At some point you don’t want to be doing it through your unemployment system. You want to be doing it in a more sensible way through your tax system or the earned-income tax credit or better benefits in the form of universal health insurance, things like that. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: So, one early and ',\n",
       "   ' was about fiscal policy. And you argued that fiscal policy during the Depression didn’t help the recovery all that much. And that finding of yours has been interpreted over the years as an argument against fiscal intervention — which, as I read your work, was not at all what you intended. So, can you just quickly summarize your actual finding and then describe the misinterpretation, then we’ll take it from there. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The actual finding is, if you look at what it was that helped the economy to recover from the Great Depression, the monetary actions that Roosevelt took when he came in were much more important. That didn’t have anything to do with whether fiscal policy could have been valuable. It was just the fact that we didn’t do all that much fiscal stimulus in the mid-1930s. And so it was not the main driver of the recovery. ',\n",
       "   'Much of my subsequent work — and all of it joint with my favorite co-author and also husband, David Romer — has actually been pointing out that fiscal policy is very effective. ',\n",
       "   'So, we have a paper looking at the effects of tax changes. And if you cut people’s taxes it does help to stimulate the economy in the short run. It helps you to increase demand and get an increase in output. We’ve looked at the effect of transfer payments, and that, too, has a substantial ',\n",
       "   '. I think we’ve done some very important work saying that fiscal policy is really valuable. It just turned out it was not used in a nearly aggressive enough way in the Depression to have been a big factor accounting for that recovery. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Although Roosevelt must have felt that he was using a lot of fiscal stimulus, yes? It seemed like a lot at the time relative to what had been done in the past? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: Oh, of course. Right. And it was even a lot in an absolute amount in the sense that the actions taken by the federal government were pretty substantial. But if you look at the total fiscal situation for the U.S., because state and local governments were going in the opposite direction of hunkering down, of actually raising taxes, cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus was pretty small because the states counteracted anything Roosevelt was doing on the positive side. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: We should also say — this is tangential, but I can’t let it pass without saying — that among your husband’s most noteworthy research has to do not with depressions, recessions, but with ',\n",
       "   '. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: True. He calls that one his midlife-crisis paper. Even he would tell you, his most important work is on monetary and fiscal policy and financial crises. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: But I gather that Bill Belichick read the paper and integrated it into his philosophy, yes? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I believe he did read the paper. But you’d have to talk to David about whether he listened to it enough. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Obviously it is tangential to our conversation, and yet in some way it’s not — which is that it was an empirical finding which argued that using the tools of economic analysis, you can determine that almost all football coaches are playing fourth-down wrong and that they should punt much less than they do. And yet it’s been mostly ignored by all but maybe a handful of coaches. Do you see equivalent empirical research done in the realm of fiscal or monetary policy that is demonstrably correct or at least worth considering among the tribe of economists, but is largely ignored by practitioners?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: One of the things that’s been nice is that in a lot of macro research, it actually has been the opposite of ignored, that policymakers have listened. So, I think especially central bankers have been very interested in academic research on the effectiveness of quantitative easing or the impact of monetary policy or credit, things like that. So, I think on the monetary side, there is a lot of interest in research and learning from the research. On the fiscal side, it’s been a mixed bag. I feel there’s a lot of professional research that fiscal policy can be very effective. ',\n",
       "   'When I was in the Obama administration, certainly later in the Obama administration, when he desperately needed more fiscal stimulus, that was the moment when policymakers, especially Republican policymakers, decided that, “No, fiscal policy didn’t do anything.” But then part of what’s happened over the last 10 years is there’s just been paper after paper looking at what was done in the Recovery Act, ',\n",
       "   ' across countries in terms of their ',\n",
       "   '. And those, again, almost uniformly find that ',\n",
       "   '. So, I’ve taken a little bit of relief that, facing this crisis, Congress said, “I guess we’ll do it again. In fact, we’ll do even more.” So, maybe policymakers are, in fact, listening and realize that these things do help. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I have to say, when I first started paying attention to economics years ago, it was one of the things that most dispirited me, because I found that the greatest economists of the era were still debating the degree to which fiscal policy during the Depression either helped end the Depression or, on the other hand, exacerbated it.',\n",
       "   ' And I thought, “Well, wait, if these people can’t tell us the answer to that question perhaps you’re not very useful to us.” I don’t mean to indict your whole tribe, but you’re saying that you feel there has been more consensus, at least on that kind of macro policy intervention in the last 10 or so years, yeah?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I do. I think if you look, say, at the University of Chicago’s — their panel of experts, if you say, “What did the Recovery Act do?” Some very large fraction will say, “It ',\n",
       "   '.” ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: We should say that’s a survey that U of C runs. It’s not all University of Chicago economists. ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: No, no, no. It’s actually a very wide range of economists. So, I think everyone wants to say, “Oh, economists all disagree.” I think you can always find somebody to take the other side. But it’s often the case that 90 percent of economists believe one thing and 10 percent believe the other. And so the vast majority would say monetary policy is very important. Vast majority would say if you cut people’s taxes, that will indeed stimulate the economy in the short run. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Okay, so let’s, in our remaining time, look at the future as best we can. It’s obviously unpredictable. I’m curious, when you look at the policy that you see being considered and being made now, fiscal and monetary policy, and if you try to play it out in your mind — not just a few months from now, but a few years, maybe many years from now — I’m especially curious if you think there are any lessons from the Depression in particular that we should be taking, especially when the cure turns out to be as dangerous as the ailment itself. ',\n",
       "   'So, one example I think about — this is not a perfect parallel — but after the war, when there were wage controls, and health insurance began to be offered as a fringe benefit and bundled with employment, which is something that most health economists say is one of the really difficult things about our health care system now. When you look at the policies being considered or made now, what you think we should watch out for, what might be some sad or difficult downstream effects? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: The one that worries me is the budget deficit. So, not in the immediate term, but if you think about how much money we’re spending, it’s completely appropriate. We need to be doing it. But we are better at running budget deficits now than we are at dealing with them when the crisis has passed. And so if we keep dealing with crises but then not getting our fiscal house in order afterwards, at some point, we’re not even going to be able to deal with the crises, because we will have run our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio up so high. ',\n",
       "   'We should have a plan to raise taxes eventually to get back in a more sustainable system. I think the pandemic may well exacerbate inequality. And that was already a terrible problem. So, I think we need to be getting through this, but also thinking about, what do we do when we’re through all of this to make sure that we’re sharing the benefits of this amazing economy much more broadly, much more fairly. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I do feel compelled to point out that it’s a little disorienting to speak to you, a Democratic or Democratic-associated, at least, economist, who is urging against a certain level of deficit spending because we’re used to Republicans saying that. Especially recently, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he pledged to use what he called the Fed’s “full range of tools” to support the economy. ',\n",
       "   'And he also urged policymakers to not worry so much about raising debt and instead to use what he called the “great fiscal power of the United States” to get through this with “as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible.” So, is this just a matter of the Republicans are in office now and you respond to the crisis in front of you? Or has there been some kind of switching of direction for Democrats and Republicans, or economists who support them, when it comes to deficit spending? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I want to be clear. I am wildly in favor of doing the deficit spending that we’re doing now. We need to do this. I agree completely with Chair Powell that we should be doing anything we need to do to get the economy through this crisis. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t think about the deficit. Even in 2010, we’re not about to try to deal with the deficit right then. ',\n",
       "   'But we were talking about it. Because you need a plan for three years, five years from now, how do we deal with this? And perhaps because I believe so firmly that fiscal stimulus is a crucially valuable tool, I want to make sure it’s there the next time we face something like this. And so I think I’ve been very aware of the need to, when you make it through a hard time and you’re back in the good times, that’s when you repair the roof on your house. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: Right. So, are we all going to come out of this okay, do you think?',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I hope so. I mean, there are going to be some workers whose jobs disappear forever. We’re not just going to go back to the way we were. So I think we could all come out of this okay, provided we take the policy actions that we need. We invest in the training to make sure everybody’s okay. I worry that we’ll get through the worst of it and then we’ll forget about some of the people that have been hurt and that remain struggling. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: And let’s say that some of the changes that have happened thus far to travel, to live entertainment, to restaurants — basically all of them wiped down close to zero — let’s say that for a variety of reasons, they sort of stick, and that people don’t return to them, in in large numbers at least. Do you feel that the U.S. economy and our brand of capitalism is still set up to be as vibrant and nimble to adjust and for people to job-reallocate? Or do you worry that a lot of people in those industries, which employ millions of people, that they will essentially be adrift, perhaps for a long time, unable to reallocate into commensurate jobs? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I think many of them will be able to reallocate. Again, I have a lot of faith in workers and in their ability to develop new skills and find jobs when they’re available. I think they’ll need a helping hand. They’ll need support in the period in which they are trying to learn a new skill. It also is going to be a lot easier for a 25- or a 30-year-old worker than it’s going to be for a 55- or a 60-year-old worker. ',\n",
       "   'DUBNER: I sometimes think that this moment is, that if you were looking at this from the future, like an archeologist looking at sediment, like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, ultimately, that this is going to have a huge scarring effect on the world. And maybe I’m totally wrong. But my sense is that this disruption has already led just about everybody to question the way they live their life, the way they earn their living, the way they interact with their families, the rest of society, community, and so on. When you look down the road, do you think the world is fundamentally different? And if so, on what levels? Or do you think I’m maybe being way melodramatic here? ',\n",
       "   'ROMER: I’m perhaps not quite as dramatic as you, but I agree that this may set off a sea change. I think you’re right that we will probably trade less, travel less, work differently. Whether it is a giant shift or just a moderate shift, I’m less sure, but I think it is going to change things. And I think the real question is how well we manage this. ',\n",
       "   'Do we manage it so that it changes things, but we’re all still okay or did it change things and make some of our underlying problems even worse? ',\n",

And so this was a point when the sport might really have taken off and women’s soccer become a sport in its own right. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: The Football Association is the governing body of soccer in England, and it was founded in 1863. So, it’s important to state that already the F.A. was discouraging women’s soccer — so back as far as 1902, they’d suggested that their affiliated organizations ought not to permit games against lady teams.',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: The owners of the men’s professional teams complained about the game at Everton because they saw it as a threat. If women’s soccer became popular and could attract those kinds of gates, that would take away from the men’s professional team. ',\n",
       "   'They persuaded the F.A. to pass a resolution, and the resolution read as follows: “Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the council feels impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. For these reasons, the council requests the clubs belonging to the association to refuse the use of their grounds for such matches.” And that was the ban. ',\n",
       "   'SZYMANSKI: Because women couldn’t play, and not only women couldn’t play — girls couldn’t play at school. There were no girls’ teams in schools.

So, in terms of the U.S. national teams, for example, in terms of reaching the quarterfinal, which the U.S. men don’t, and which the U.S. women always do, getting to the quarterfinals for last World Cup would have been worth over $550,000 to the men, but only $90,000 to the women.

       "   'SZYMANSKI: Well, one of the problems with evaluating parity between men and women is: FIFA doesn’t even really offer very clear data on how much money the Women’s World Cup generates. We know the men’s World Cup generates about $6 billion. And the Women’s World Cup presumably generates significantly less than that. However, many people have observed that this is partly a failing of promotion on the part of FIFA.',\n",

But throughout history, we see that many firms who subscribe to economic theory when it’s good for them, when they see competition that they think is not good for them all of a sudden, they don’t want economics to work the way it’s supposed to work, or they don’t want the competition.

Antitrust is a set of laws which specifically intended to prohibit businesses from stopping other businesses from competing against them. And these laws are enforced fairly rigorously. If they’d had an antitrust suit back in the 1920s and won it, then they could have stopped this dead in their tracks and history would have been different. But what people will say now is, “Well, who are we going to prosecute? How are we going to hold someone responsible?” And that’s obviously problematic. But on the other hand, if you have a clearly identified wrong, which has clear consequences, I think something should be done about it. ',\n",

       " 'HOSOI: You have to think about skill and luck as a spectrum and ask, “Where do these activities fit on the spectrum?” Nothing is purely luck or purely skill. Like when you drive to work, it’s mostly skill, but you also got lucky that nobody ran into you.',\n",
       " 'HOSOI: If you’re flipping coins, on average a person would win half of their games in the first half and half their games in the second half. If it’s a game of, let’s say, a grandmaster in chess playing against a novice, they’ll probably win all the games.',\n",
       " 'HOSOI: So, we split it into fantasy baseball, fantasy hockey, fantasy basketball, and fantasy football. And if you’re trying to explain to, let’s say, an attorney general where fantasy sports lie on the spectrum, you have to give them something to compare it to, right? The number that we give them doesn’t mean anything on its own. So, then we compared that to real baseball, hockey, basketball, and football.',\n",

       " 'Now I’m going to move to the skill end of the spectrum. The one that is that is the top end of the skill spectrum is bicycle racing. Which, again, makes sense because if you’re fast, you’re fast. Right? Sometimes you have bad luck in a bicycle race. But for the most part, whoever is going to put out the most power is going to win. ',\n",
       " 'So, now we come to the interesting chunk of the spectrum, which lies sort of between .6 and .9. So, basketball rewards skill the most, hockey rewards skill the least. Because basketball has a large number of scoring opportunities in each game and a large number of games in the season. So, that means that one lucky shot in basketball doesn’t matter very much. Whereas one lucky shot in hockey can matter a lot. And football and baseball are somewhere in the middle.',\n",
       " 'HOSOI: The fantasy sports are closely tied to where the real sports sit.',\n",
       " 'HOSOI: Which is not super-surprising because the further up on the spectrum you are, the easier it is to predict the outcome. And if it is easy to predict the outcome, then it is easier to choose players in your fantasy lineup.',\n",
       " 'HOSOI: So, No. 1: learn some statistics. There are lots of ways to do well in fantasy sports. And my first recommendation would be to not play in the tournaments but to play in something like a 50/50. So, a 50/50, everybody pays in the same amount and the top 50 percent of the finishers double their money and the bottom 50 percent lose their money. ',\n",

But the vast majority of golf prizes are won by a small group of people, too. But it doesn’t mean you have to compete against them. So, there’s different prize pools in different areas that each player can play in. The people who are playing for large amounts are also putting up large amounts.

So, we thought that there is a broad market in the U.S. of people that for years have been confined to the black market for all kinds of activities — sports betting being one of them, and the audience we felt had been validated during the online-poker boom in the early 2000s. So, we said, “Look, for the meantime — and maybe for a while — the way to serve them will be fantasy sports.” But we all absolutely believed long-term that other forms of sports betting and gaming that hadn’t been legalized at this point but were very prevalent in other countries, that those would be made legal here, and it actually happened a lot faster than we thought.

Or does it just cause people to stop going to the casino and stop buying lottery tickets, and start betting on the N.F.L. instead? And that’s a real question.

Not the sort of thing that most athletes are willing to sacrifice in order to earn $10,000 under the table from some black-market bookie. On the other hand, the big loser in this whole thing is for sure the N.C.A.A. Because the N.C.A.A. is absolutely ripe for corruption here.',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Which means players are a massive target for corruption.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: Here’s what the N.C.A.A.’s web page says. “The N.C.A.A. opposes all forms of legal and illegal sports wagering, which has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the welfare of student athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community.” ',\n",
       " 'What is the N.C.A.A. going to do now that sports gambling is legal in many states? They can’t prevent, let’s say, a DraftKings or a casino from allowing betting on their sport, can they?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: They cannot.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: So, what happens?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: This is a real conflict, and I actually agree with everything the N.C.A.A. says there. Gambling certainly does have the possibility to undermine the integrity of sports. And it has particularly the worry to undermine college sports — again, because college athletes are generating huge amounts of money for the N.C.A.A. while not getting paid. ',\n",
       " 'The obvious solution is: pay the athletes what they’re worth. But we’re not going to see that anytime soon, so— they’re going to maintain their integrity by policing their athletes rather than, by actually giving them a living wage.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: Right. Meaning the more you’re paid, the less incentive you have to throw a game. Or to participate at all, collaborate with gamblers. ',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Historically, one of the most corrupt sports is cricket. And that’s because until about 20 years ago, the only cricket out there were national team games. So, India playing Pakistan or England playing Australia. The problem is, you didn’t have any free agency, because it’s very hard for an Australian to become an Indian. And so players were stuck on their teams. And because players were stuck on their teams, they didn’t make much money. Even though cricket was wildly popular in places like India. ',\n",
       " 'So, here you have a sport where there are literally hundreds of millions of people watching. But the athletes themselves weren’t making any money. That is pretty much the prime recipe for corruption. And again, massive corruption in cricket, both known and suspected. ',\n",
       " 'But guess what — about 10 years ago, they started actually playing some professional club cricket called the I.P.L., the Indian Premier League. And now you actually have cricket players making some decent money. There’s evidence that suggests that the number of suspicious matches in cricket has gone down since cricketers started actually making some real money and have something to lose if they get caught.',\n",
       " 'ROBINS: So, I mean, this is another area where we’re completely aligned with everyone else.',\n",
       " 'ROBINS: We don’t want to get defrauded either. It costs us money, costs us reputation. It potentially sours people’s views towards the sport’s integrity. It makes them less likely to want to see regulated sports betting in more markets, so we’re 100 percent aligned there. You know, being able to tell right away if there’s irregular activity and report it to the proper authorities, that’s really an important part of the role that we play.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: So, let’s say that I bribe the 154th-ranked world men’s tennis player, and all I get him to do is to intentionally double fault on the fourth serve of the sixth game of the third set. And I put 20 grand on that.',\n",
       " 'ROBINS: So, I mean, that’s an easy one, because you’d be a huge outlier betting 20 grand on a single point that also wasn’t betting that kind of volume on any other points anywhere else in the match, so it would stick out like a sore thumb. And whether we were a black market or a legal regulated book, we would immediately flag that and say we’re not taking that bet. The difference is, we would report it to the authorities.',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: There’s no doubt that big data allows you to engage in all sorts of gambling strategies that look like they have an advantage for you. The problem is most of that turns out to be data mining. It works great looking backwards, but going forwards it doesn’t work. So, that’s No. 1. ',\n",
       " 'No. 2 is that even when you find a strategy that works, you got to keep it under wraps, which is hard. You can’t have these anomalies persist very long before someone figures it out. And then all of a sudden, they get priced in.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: Related question then: is the stock market, in your view, a form of gambling?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Absolutely, there’s no question about it. ',\n",
       " 'The difference is this: is that historically, yeah, there’s no doubt that betting on the stock market is purely gambling. That being said, it’s a gamble that in the long run pays a positive net return. Gambling on sports has a negative expected return.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: Right, but let’s also talk about where the money is going. When I buy a stock, the company indirectly is getting money to fund their operations and research and so on, right?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Correct.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: When I make a bet, let’s say, on a sports team, the athletes are not getting any of that. So, that money is being directed to a different set of winners. If you could orchestrate the way the handle was divvied, would you do it differently than it exists now?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Ah, that’s a good question. I hadn’t thought about that before. Yeah. The place that the money goes now is — the casino takes what’s called the vig, takes a piece of that money, for facilitating the bet. And the rest goes out as winnings to the side that wins. Anything that the N.C.A.A. or the N.F.L. makes right now is all incidental. The way they benefit is maybe the person who takes out that bet is more likely to tune in to the game or go to the game and therefore that’s how the N.C.A.A. gets the money. Mind you, the N.B.A. and N.F.L. and other pro leagues in the United States have been trying to negotiate with states saying, “Hey, we’re the ones whose product is being bet on. We should get a piece of that bet.” As of this point, I don’t think the leagues have been successful in negotiating any of those yet. But there’s no reason to think they can’t be.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: I do like what it’s been called in some cases — they call it an integrity tax.',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: To be fair, if the N.C.A.A. or other sports have to engage in a lot more compliance and a lot more investigation to keep their athletes honest redirecting some portion of the gambling to those extra expenses might be fair.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: On the other hand, ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " ' that he estimates that legalized sports gambling will basically double the valuation of franchises, which has nothing to do with the money flowing directly from the gamblers themselves, right?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: That’s exactly right. If you’re going to say that pro-sports leagues should get money from the casinos for the extra costs, then it would also be exactly fair that the N.B.A. should have to pay casinos for the extra benefits. And I don’t think the leagues have been saying that.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: So, in your view, does the oncoming legalization of sports gambling in states across the U.S. — especially very accessible gambling via, let’s say, a phone app — does that spike demand for sports gambling, and to what degree?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: There is reason to believe that sports gamblers are different than all gamblers. In that legalizing sports gambling actually brings new people into the gambling realm who wouldn’t otherwise be buying lottery tickets or playing craps or playing the one-armed bandit in the casinos.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: Is spending on sports gambling regressive?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: I don’t think we have nearly enough data to answer that question. We certainly know that gambling on, for example, lottery tickets — highly regressive, especially scratch-off tickets. Super regressive. We do know that gambling is associated with lots of bad social effects. We know that introduction of state lotteries and casinos into neighborhoods increases crime. It increases bankruptcy. A huge portion of consumer bankruptcies involve at least some amount of gambling that occurs. ',\n",
       " 'And there’s reason to believe that sports gambling puts a particular group at specific risk. Think of all those sports fans who say, ‘“You know, I would never buy a lottery ticket. That’s just luck. But I know everything about sports. I should be able to win this.” And guess what? You can’t beat the casino. These amateurs who think they’re experts don’t stand a chance, but do stand a chance of really getting sucked in. And the question is how quickly can they extricate themselves and realize that, “Yeah, I’m actually not any good at this.”',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: So, that sounds potentially pretty bad, at least for the subset of people who are potential problem gamblers. Again, I realize you’re an economist, not a political scientist, not a politician, not a theologian. But are you concerned that the fairly rapid legalization of sports gambling in the U.S. is going to lead to pretty significant downsides, at least for a certain portion of the population?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Yes. So, I’m a college professor, so I’m concerned about my students. And the data looks like this: about 75 percent of all college students report having gambled in the previous year. About 6 percent of college students report having a severe gambling disorder resulting in psychological difficulties, unmanageable debt, failing grades, all these bad things. Male students are even more likely to have gambled and they report',\n",
       " 'more problems with gambling more money and having gambling problems. And compared to students without gambling problems, these students are also more likely to use tobacco, to drink heavily, to binge-drink, smoke marijuana, use other illegal drugs, drive under the influence, have a low G.P.A. We shouldn’t at all pretend that gambling is completely victimless.',\n",
       " 'National Council on Problem Gambling',\n",
       " '1 percent',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: There is not a uniform reporting of gambling across places. For example, at least officially, the numbers in the United States are something like 10 times higher than the numbers in Germany. Now the question is, is that because all Germans are very rational people who would never get themselves involved in this? Or do the Germans just have a much different definition of what you mean by problem gambling?',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: How much would you say that the median sports gambler operates on logic and all its manifestations versus emotion?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: We know that they operate a ton on emotion. We talk about casinos balancing the books so that they make money either way. But casinos also do a pretty good job of following the dumb money.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: So, Victor, you’ve told us about all the ways in which sports bettors are illogical and emotional and overconfident. So, let’s say I’m all of those, but I still want to bet, and I want to increase my chances a little bit. Do you have any advice for how to be a less terrible gambler?',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: Yeah, actually the one sports gamble that we know has a long-run payoff is actually betting on the horse races and betting heavy favorites to show. So, what that means is you’re taking a horse that everyone thinks is going to win the race, and you bet on them to at least come in no worse than third. It turns out that is a winning bet, dollar-wise.',\n",
       " 'DUBNER: That is so boring.',\n",
       " 'MATHESON: It is literally the most boring way to watch a horse race in the history of horse racing. But it makes money. It’s a gambling strategy only an economist could love.',\n",
       " 'ROBINS: You know, that’s not something we want — we’d like to build a big independent company. And what’s interesting about our space is that because of the regulatory aspects of it and because it’s state by state, it’s not going to be, all at once, this huge opportunity. The opportunity could take several years to get bigger and bigger. But I think you might see where some of the bigger companies are, like, “There’s a lot of regulatory stuff we’ve got to deal with.” So, that gives us a window, but that window is not open forever.',\n",

I think there could be a $100-billion-plus company built in this space. So, we’re going after that kind of size opportunity.',\n",

The first episode comes out at 11 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, August 21st. We’ll actually be putting out the first four episodes of Levitt’s new show right here in the    feed, every other Friday night. But we encourage you to subscribe to   on your favorite podcast app. That way, you’ll be sure to never miss an episode.   And now, we’re playing for you an episode about the economics of sports gambling that we first released last year. You remember sports, right? Back in March, as the Covid-19 pandemic was setting in,   , including the professional leagues, March Madness, the Summer Olympics.   In their absence, e-sports continued to grow — along with gambling on e-sports. And now,   live sports are making their way   , albeit without live fans.   This is good news not only for people who like to watch sports but, again, for those who like to bet on them. The pent-up demand for betting opportunities, coupled with the fact that online betting is a very pandemic-friendly activity, means that the sports-betting industry, which seemed to be in pretty good shape last year when we reported this episode, is now   .   So, here’s our look at the past, present, and future of sports gambling. Hope you enjoy.   Stephen DUBNER: I understand that you may be the longest-running player in fantasy-sports history, the longest-running continuous player. Is that true?  Peter GETHERS  : Not “may be.” No question about it. Absolutely. Because I was in the original   , so one of the founders of fantasy sports. Nobody from that league is still playing. I’m still in the original league. Everyone’s been replaced. So, there’s no question. I’m the longest-living continuous fantasy-sports player on the planet Earth.  Peter Gethers  GETHERS: I do various things.  GETHERS: I’m a novelist and nonfiction book writer, a screenwriter, a television writer and producer, a playwright, and I’m an editor and publisher at the Knopf Publishing Group at Penguin Random House.  GETHERS:   , who then was the editor-in-chief of   . A couple of people at   :   ;   , who I think then was writing for   . There was one woman, Valerie Salembier, who was a magazine publisher.  Dan Okrent  GETHERS: Dan had played a very loose version of this in college and then went, “Wait, this would be really fun.” It’s for people who would want to own a baseball team, but aren’t rich enough to own a baseball team. In those days, to be    without George Steinbrenner’s money was the way he thought of it.  Seinfeld.  : George Steinbrenner here. I want to talk about George Costanza. I understand he’s been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.  DUBNER: Okay. So, for someone who doesn’t know fantasy sports at all, and maybe doesn’t even really know sports at all, give me just a very nice elevator description of fantasy baseball, how it worked.  GETHERS: So, you put any sum of money that works — in the league I play in, the initial input is $260, and you have to put together a team roster, the same way the Yankees or the Mets or the Dodgers or the Kansas City Royals do, within a budget of $260. In my league, we do it by auction. So, if you bid $8 for a player you then have $252 to pay for the rest of your players. And what the player you own does every day, that goes into your stat sheet and it’s cumulative. And at the end of the year, the team with the best statistics wins the pennant.  GETHERS: It’s pretty definitive.  GETHERS: I was called in because there was someone else who had a team who decided he couldn’t afford the original $250 entry fee.  DUBNER: Oh, you were a minor-leaguer who was called up.  GETHERS: Exactly. And I couldn’t afford the $250 fee either, so I split it with a guy named Glen Waggoner. And we became partners and we won the first year.   DUBNER: How much did you win, then?  GETHERS: We won  close to $3,000.  DUBNER: Now, was this considered gambling at the time, do you know?  GETHERS: Do you have people from the I.R.S. listening?  DUBNER: Not yet. We’re going to forward the tape to them as soon as we’re done.  GETHERS: Okay. Then, no. If you’re not from the I.R.S. — yes, of course it’s gambling. The whole thing was created to gamble.  GETHERS: On Final Four weekend of March Madness, I have, for the last 35 years, gone to Las Vegas with the same group of guys. And we gamble non-stop for 48 hours. And I like gambling so much that I don’t really care if I win or lose. I can’t think of anything that’s as much fun for me.  GETHERS: We were invited on to    and we talked about how it worked and what we did. And then —    was the host of    then — he started a league and then it started to really, really catch on.  fantasy sports  100 million players  cricket  revenues  DUBNER: So, as you well know, fantasy sports has become really big business.   GETHERS: Yes.  DUBNER: As an originator, how big is your Tuscan villa?  GETHERS: It’s about the size of a small Days Inn hotel room. No, here is what happened. We invented this thing. We did it for fun. It truly never occurred to us that a ton of other people would also want to do this. Even though almost everybody in the league was a person whose whole life and job was to observe cultural trends and capitalize on them. It never occurred to us, and we did it before computers. When everything went online, everything changed.  U.S. Supreme Court  : Breaking news, the Supreme Court this morning, striking down the federal ban on sports betting.  : We’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bets made since we launched, and it seems to be getting bigger every month.  ROBINS: Pretty much from the earliest age I can remember, I had an interest in sports. My parents were both big sports fans. My dad and mom both also actively played sports. First thing I can ever remember watching on T.V. was E.S.P.N. As I got older and I got more into numbers and things — and also simultaneously I was finding out that I’m not so good on the actual field or on the court or whatever — at the time, there was still box scores in the newspapers, and I would play a game with my parents where they would quiz me after I would read the box scores, and I’d try to remember every little detail.  ROBINS: And as soon as the internet started to have fantasy sports come about in the late ’90s, early 2000s, it was instant love for me.  ROBINS: There were a lot of startups, companies like MyFantasyLeagues, SportsLine — which C.B.S. eventually bought. There was some kind of joint venture between C.N.N. and    I was just trying every one of them.  ROBINS: So, I was— almost a decade, I was in corporate America  Paul Liberman  Matt Kalish  company  ROBINS: Matt, one day, sat me down, was like, “I have an interesting idea you’re going to like.” So, he told me the very high-level basis for   .  ROBINS: I went home, and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it that night, and then we proceeded for the next six months or so to just fumble around, trying to figure out how to get it off the ground.  FanDuel  ROBINS: Oh, I mean, at least 50, maybe closer to 100, and some of them were brutal. I mean, they would take us to second, third, fourth meeting, where like, “Alright, they’re going to get there, they’re going to get there,” and then we just couldn’t get there.  ROBINS: Everybody was telling me that’s a sin when you’re out trying to raise funding, that the investor says, “If you don’t believe in the idea enough to do it full-time, why should I believe enough in it to put a bunch of money in?” Which is fair, but there’s natural constraints. I mean, none of us came from wealthy backgrounds, and we were using what little money we had saved to fund the business. So, eventually we figured out a way to time it where we told an investor we were committed to quitting on a certain timeframe, assuming that they put money in, and that worked.  ROBINS: We had really been trained at companies and in areas — tech analytics and marketing — that we thought were core to really building the best mousetrap in daily fantasy sports.   : Because DraftKings.com combines one-day fantasy sports with winning life-changing amounts of cash.  ROBINS: We have north of 11, south of 12 million registered users that are playing a combination of free and pay games. As far as market share goes, our best guess in fantasy is we’re about 60 percent of the market.  ROBINS: In some of these games, where you have tens of thousands of participants, there can be prizes ranging in the $100,000 or even $1 million-plus range if you finish first.  DUBNER: And what cut has DraftKings historically taken?  ROBINS: We take about 10 percent.   illegal  Victor MATHESON  : You might have as much as $300 billion being bet in the United States every year.  Victor Matheson  MATHESON: That’s what people estimate might be going on under the table.  MATHESON: For an economist, “black market” doesn’t mean “bad things.” Black market for an economist simply means that this is something that’s not recorded, and the government doesn’t know about. So, when I ask my students what sort of black-market activities are out there? They’ll tell me, “Drugs, prostitution, gambling, running guns,” and I will come right back, and I’ll tell them “Oh yeah — and babysitting and mowing lawns.”  The New York Times   insider information  ROBINS: So, what actually happened was, this employee got sent via secure means some data that included picks on our platform for later games. And those later games were not on our platform locked yet, but on FanDuel they were. FanDuel actually had a different setup where you could not enter players in later games and then change them during the earlier games. You had to pick all of them up front. So, that information could not have even possibly benefited that employee, not to mention the fact that FanDuel actually was making public the overall pick information, which is what he had published because they lock theirs. So, it was kind of a trumped-up story. Unfortunately, the media had already run with the story, calling it insider whatever.  banning  ROBINS: It was damage-control time for us, and then that led to having state regulators start to come down on us.  ROBINS: So, the way that something gets determined to be gambling in most states is it has to hit all three of three criteria. There has to be consideration, which means something of value is paid to enter.  ROBINS: There has to be prizing, which means something of value comes out when you win.  ROBINS: And then there has to be chance — and whether it’s chance or skill then falls at the state level to define.  FanDuel  ROBINS: In the early years, there was a pretty intense rivalry, and of course there’s still some element of that now. But as we were getting attacked by attorneys general in a handful of states, that forced us to come together on the legislative- and government-affairs policy front. And we’ve been collaborating on that since early 2015.  ROBINS: The reason we tried to merge is both companies thought they could be successful combining forces and working together, and the reason it didn’t happen was the government blocking it.   blocked  acquired  which is now known as Flutter. It’s   : So, the  paper   we wrote is called “  .”  HOSOI: I’m a professor of mechanical engineering at M.I.T.  HOSOI: So, we bring students and faculty together with pro teams and industry partners to look at sort of the abundance of data that’s coming out of sports today.  HOSOI: They asked us, if they gave us their entire data set, could we tell them whether or not these contests were contests of skill or contests of chance.  HOSOI: I told them, “This is a terrific question. More than happy to look into it.” And I also told them that we were going to publish the results regardless of what the outcome was. And they said, “That’s fine.” So, I said, “Great, send us the data.”  HOSOI: You have to think about skill and luck as a spectrum and ask, “Where do these activities fit on the spectrum?” Nothing is purely luck or purely skill. Like when you drive to work, it’s mostly skill, but you also got lucky that nobody ran into you.  HOSOI: If you’re flipping coins, on average a person would win half of their games in the first half and half their games in the second half. If it’s a game of, let’s say, a grandmaster in chess playing against a novice, they’ll probably win all the games.  HOSOI: So, we split it into fantasy baseball, fantasy hockey, fantasy basketball, and fantasy football. And if you’re trying to explain to, let’s say, an attorney general where fantasy sports lie on the spectrum, you have to give them something to compare it to, right? The number that we give them doesn’t mean anything on its own. So, then we compared that to real baseball, hockey, basketball, and football.  HOSOI: We also included bicycle-racing, coin-flipping, and the stock market. We put all of those on a spectrum to see where fantasy sports clustered.  HOSOI: So, imagine a spectrum where zero is pure luck and one is pure skill. Coin-flipping sat at zero. Which is good. So: check. The algorithm gets that right. The next point on the luck end of the spectrum was the stock market. So, that sat at about a third of the way up.   Now I’m going to move to the skill end of the spectrum. The one that is that is the top end of the skill spectrum is bicycle racing. Which, again, makes sense because if you’re fast, you’re fast. Right? Sometimes you have bad luck in a bicycle race. But for the most part, whoever is going to put out the most power is going to win.   So, now we come to the interesting chunk of the spectrum, which lies sort of between .6 and .9. So, basketball rewards skill the most, hockey rewards skill the least. Because basketball has a large number of scoring opportunities in each game and a large number of games in the season. So, that means that one lucky shot in basketball doesn’t matter very much. Whereas one lucky shot in hockey can matter a lot. And football and baseball are somewhere in the middle.  HOSOI: The fantasy sports are closely tied to where the real sports sit.  HOSOI: Which is not super-surprising because the further up on the spectrum you are, the easier it is to predict the outcome. And if it is easy to predict the outcome, then it is easier to choose players in your fantasy lineup.  HOSOI: So, No. 1: learn some statistics. There are lots of ways to do well in fantasy sports. And my first recommendation would be to not play in the tournaments but to play in something like a 50/50. So, a 50/50, everybody pays in the same amount and the top 50 percent of the finishers double their money and the bottom 50 percent lose their money.   study  ROBINS: Well, what people don’t like to report is that same group is also doing all the gameplay.  ROBINS: So, it’s a skill game, and people who are better-skilled compete at different levels. If I go golf, maybe I can play in my amateur tournament. I’m not competing in the Masters. But the vast majority of golf prizes are won by a small group of people, too. But it doesn’t mean you have to compete against them. So, there’s different prize pools in different areas that each player can play in. The people who are playing for large amounts are also putting up large amounts. Those people are generally playing with other players that are like them.  ROBINS: Right now, it’s just in [New] Jersey, online and mobile.  ROBINS: I think you’re going to see a number of laws passed this year, and I think    is going to be a big year for a bunch of new states getting launched.  online sports betting  Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia  ROBINS: We’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of bets made since we launched, and it seems to be getting bigger every month.  DUBNER: As a revenue center for DraftKings, what’s going to be bigger in the future: straight-up sports betting or fantasy sports?  ROBINS: It will definitely be sports betting. Even in this short time and in Jersey, it’s already become a substantial portion of our business. Way more so than the same size customer fantasy revenues coming from the Jersey market.  DUBNER: Was the possibility of legalized sports gambling on your horizon from the outset? Was the long-term plan built around the possibility of that?  ROBINS: Definitely. So, we thought that there is a broad market in the U.S. of people that for years have been confined to the black market for all kinds of activities — sports betting being one of them, and the audience we felt had been validated during the online-poker boom in the early 2000s. So, we said, “Look, for the meantime — and maybe for a while — the way to serve them will be fantasy sports.” But we all absolutely believed long-term that other forms of sports betting and gaming that hadn’t been legalized at this point but were very prevalent in other countries, that those would be made legal here, and it actually happened a lot faster than we thought. But that was always part of the long-term thinking.  MATHESON: I also do gambling economics. I’ve done a lot of research on lotteries and other types of gaming. So, of course sports gambling is right up my alley.  DUBNER: So, sports go back pretty much to the beginning of human civilization. What about sports gambling?  MATHESON: Yeah. So, the oldest organized sports that we have a good date on is the Olympics. The Olympics came about in 776 B.C. We have good evidence of that. We have fairly good evidence that the first gambling on the Olympics occurred in about 775 B.C. So, as soon as they started playing games, someone started gambling on it.  Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association  strike down  MATHESON: Prior to this ruling, Congress had said that it was illegal for a state to legalize gambling.  MATHESON: So, I know that’s a little goofy, but again, Congress said it was illegal for states to legalize sports gambling unless those states were already engaging in it. What the Supreme Court ruling said is it didn’t legalize sports gambling, but it made it illegal for the federal government to prohibit states from legalizing. That’s a little bit harder to get the mind around here, but it doesn’t all of a sudden mean that everything is legal everywhere. But it does mean that states are now allowed to legalize it if they want.  legislation  MATHESON: States are happy to argue against gambling when it’s in their best interest, and they’re happy to argue for gambling when they can get a big cut of the money.  DUBNER: As some states legalize gambling before others, each on their own timetable depending on a number of factors and negotiations having to do with state legislators and gambling people and so on, what sort of opportunities does this staggered introduction create for economists like you to study the knock-on effects of legalized gambling?  MATHESON: This is a dream for economists. We need something to turn on one place and then turn off another place, and compare the two. So, this will really be interesting. And it will be interesting in a lot of ways, like: does the introduction of sports gambling actually increase the total amount of gambling in a state? Or does it just cause people to stop going to the casino and stop buying lottery tickets, and start betting on the N.F.L. instead? And that’s a real question. If you’re trying to raise revenue for the state, does it actually help you if people are gambling on the N.B.A., but not buying lottery tickets?  ROBINS: The taxes are always figured out as part of the legislation, because in a lot of cases, the primary reason that they’re passing it is the taxes.   ROBINS: Most of them have been in either the high single digits or low double digits.  ROBINS: But the states do need to be careful they don’t tax it too much.  ROBINS: Because if you have to pass — and you will, if you’re going to exist and survive as a business — if you have to pass some of that off to the consumer, well, those are taxes that aren’t being paid by the offshores, and they’re just going to create a better value proposition, better pricing.  MATHESON: If we’re anything like the Brits, the average American in the course of a year would end up making over $1,000 worth of bets on sports. And we know that’s true because we actually have the receipts. These are all legal bets being made through a huge network of local betting shops. Plus they’re doing much more online nowadays.  DUBNER: How would you describe gambling as a force on society? And I’m not asking you to turn into a philosopher all of a sudden or a legal scholar, but let’s concentrate on the economics of it. Anything from productivity to bankruptcy levels and so on. What does gambling tend to do?  MATHESON: So, there’s definitely some winners and losers from gambling. The winners tend to be the sports leagues themselves, because when people get interested in the sport, more people watch. I mean there’s a reason that the March Madness T.V. contract gets sold for almost a billion dollars.   Ironically, the big losers can also be the sports leagues because again, as soon as you have gambling, you have the potential for corruption, and we’ve seen this historically. The first major gambling scandal in Major League Baseball happened within a year of Major League Baseball forming — that was the   . The precursor of the N.F.L. collapsed in 1908 in large part because of gambling scandals. And of course we know of things like the    in 1919 throwing the World Series. And if people think sports are fixed, then they don’t want to watch. And so it’s this real balancing act for the leagues. They want people to be interested, but they also want people to think that there’s real fair competition.  DUBNER: I understand you, Victor, used to be an M.L.S. — Major League Soccer — referee for some number of years, yes?  MATHESON: Yes, that is correct.   DUBNER: And were you ever approached by gamblers or the representatives about altering the outcome of a match?  MATHESON: So, I was not. Although very specifically we were encouraged to not even go into a casino. And we were also encouraged to obviously report anything immediately and we were prohibited by contract from engaging in any type of sports gambling. And that would include filling out a March Madness bracket.  authorized gaming partner  partnership  partnership  MATHESON: So, it looks like most of the major sports in the United States have pretty much taken at least a moderately positive stand towards sports gambling. Again, knowing that people will be more interested in their sport if they can gamble on it, and knowing that they don’t have to worry about their athletes being on the take. Because all of our big sports, the average salaries are in the millions of dollars. Not the sort of thing that most athletes are willing to sacrifice in order to earn $10,000 under the table from some black-market bookie. On the other hand, the big loser in this whole thing is for sure the N.C.A.A. Because the N.C.A.A. is absolutely ripe for corruption here.  MATHESON: Which means players are a massive target for corruption.  DUBNER: Here’s what the N.C.A.A.’s web page says. “The N.C.A.A. opposes all forms of legal and illegal sports wagering, which has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the welfare of student athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community.”   What is the N.C.A.A. going to do now that sports gambling is legal in many states? They can’t prevent, let’s say, a DraftKings or a casino from allowing betting on their sport, can they?  MATHESON: They cannot.  DUBNER: So, what happens?  MATHESON: This is a real conflict, and I actually agree with everything the N.C.A.A. says there. Gambling certainly does have the possibility to undermine the integrity of sports. And it has particularly the worry to undermine college sports — again, because college athletes are generating huge amounts of money for the N.C.A.A. while not getting paid.   The obvious solution is: pay the athletes what they’re worth. But we’re not going to see that anytime soon, so— they’re going to maintain their integrity by policing their athletes rather than, by actually giving them a living wage.  DUBNER: Right. Meaning the more you’re paid, the less incentive you have to throw a game. Or to participate at all, collaborate with gamblers.   MATHESON: Historically, one of the most corrupt sports is cricket. And that’s because until about 20 years ago, the only cricket out there were national team games. So, India playing Pakistan or England playing Australia. The problem is, you didn’t have any free agency, because it’s very hard for an Australian to become an Indian. And so players were stuck on their teams. And because players were stuck on their teams, they didn’t make much money. Even though cricket was wildly popular in places like India.   So, here you have a sport where there are literally hundreds of millions of people watching. But the athletes themselves weren’t making any money. That is pretty much the prime recipe for corruption. And again, massive corruption in cricket, both known and suspected.   But guess what — about 10 years ago, they started actually playing some professional club cricket called the I.P.L., the Indian Premier League. And now you actually have cricket players making some decent money. There’s evidence that suggests that the number of suspicious matches in cricket has gone down since cricketers started actually making some real money and have something to lose if they get caught.  ROBINS: So, I mean, this is another area where we’re completely aligned with everyone else.  ROBINS: We don’t want to get defrauded either. It costs us money, costs us reputation. It potentially sours people’s views towards the sport’s integrity. It makes them less likely to want to see regulated sports betting in more markets, so we’re 100 percent aligned there. You know, being able to tell right away if there’s irregular activity and report it to the proper authorities, that’s really an important part of the role that we play.  DUBNER: So, let’s say that I bribe the 154th-ranked world men’s tennis player, and all I get him to do is to intentionally double fault on the fourth serve of the sixth game of the third set. And I put 20 grand on that.  ROBINS: So, I mean, that’s an easy one, because you’d be a huge outlier betting 20 grand on a single point that also wasn’t betting that kind of volume on any other points anywhere else in the match, so it would stick out like a sore thumb. And whether we were a black market or a legal regulated book, we would immediately flag that and say we’re not taking that bet. The difference is, we would report it to the authorities.  MATHESON: There’s no doubt that big data allows you to engage in all sorts of gambling strategies that look like they have an advantage for you. The problem is most of that turns out to be data mining. It works great looking backwards, but going forwards it doesn’t work. So, that’s No. 1.   No. 2 is that even when you find a strategy that works, you got to keep it under wraps, which is hard. You can’t have these anomalies persist very long before someone figures it out. And then all of a sudden, they get priced in.  DUBNER: Related question then: is the stock market, in your view, a form of gambling?  MATHESON: Absolutely, there’s no question about it.   The difference is this: is that historically, yeah, there’s no doubt that betting on the stock market is purely gambling. That being said, it’s a gamble that in the long run pays a positive net return. Gambling on sports has a negative expected return.  DUBNER: Right, but let’s also talk about where the money is going. When I buy a stock, the company indirectly is getting money to fund their operations and research and so on, right?  MATHESON: Correct.  DUBNER: When I make a bet, let’s say, on a sports team, the athletes are not getting any of that. So, that money is being directed to a different set of winners. If you could orchestrate the way the handle was divvied, would you do it differently than it exists now?  MATHESON: Ah, that’s a good question. I hadn’t thought about that before. Yeah. The place that the money goes now is — the casino takes what’s called the vig, takes a piece of that money, for facilitating the bet. And the rest goes out as winnings to the side that wins. Anything that the N.C.A.A. or the N.F.L. makes right now is all incidental. The way they benefit is maybe the person who takes out that bet is more likely to tune in to the game or go to the game and therefore that’s how the N.C.A.A. gets the money. Mind you, the N.B.A. and N.F.L. and other pro leagues in the United States have been trying to negotiate with states saying, “Hey, we’re the ones whose product is being bet on. We should get a piece of that bet.” As of this point, I don’t think the leagues have been successful in negotiating any of those yet. But there’s no reason to think they can’t be.  DUBNER: I do like what it’s been called in some cases — they call it an integrity tax.  MATHESON: To be fair, if the N.C.A.A. or other sports have to engage in a lot more compliance and a lot more investigation to keep their athletes honest redirecting some portion of the gambling to those extra expenses might be fair.  DUBNER: On the other hand,       that he estimates that legalized sports gambling will basically double the valuation of franchises, which has nothing to do with the money flowing directly from the gamblers themselves, right?  MATHESON: That’s exactly right. If you’re going to say that pro-sports leagues should get money from the casinos for the extra costs, then it would also be exactly fair that the N.B.A. should have to pay casinos for the extra benefits. And I don’t think the leagues have been saying that.  DUBNER: So, in your view, does the oncoming legalization of sports gambling in states across the U.S. — especially very accessible gambling via, let’s say, a phone app — does that spike demand for sports gambling, and to what degree?  MATHESON: There is reason to believe that sports gamblers are different than all gamblers. In that legalizing sports gambling actually brings new people into the gambling realm who wouldn’t otherwise be buying lottery tickets or playing craps or playing the one-armed bandit in the casinos.  DUBNER: Is spending on sports gambling regressive?  MATHESON: I don’t think we have nearly enough data to answer that question. We certainly know that gambling on, for example, lottery tickets — highly regressive, especially scratch-off tickets. Super regressive. We do know that gambling is associated with lots of bad social effects. We know that introduction of state lotteries and casinos into neighborhoods increases crime. It increases bankruptcy. A huge portion of consumer bankruptcies involve at least some amount of gambling that occurs.   And there’s reason to believe that sports gambling puts a particular group at specific risk. Think of all those sports fans who say, ‘“You know, I would never buy a lottery ticket. That’s just luck. But I know everything about sports. I should be able to win this.” And guess what? You can’t beat the casino. These amateurs who think they’re experts don’t stand a chance, but do stand a chance of really getting sucked in. And the question is how quickly can they extricate themselves and realize that, “Yeah, I’m actually not any good at this.”  DUBNER: So, that sounds potentially pretty bad, at least for the subset of people who are potential problem gamblers. Again, I realize you’re an economist, not a political scientist, not a politician, not a theologian. But are you concerned that the fairly rapid legalization of sports gambling in the U.S. is going to lead to pretty significant downsides, at least for a certain portion of the population?  MATHESON: Yes. So, I’m a college professor, so I’m concerned about my students. And the data looks like this: about 75 percent of all college students report having gambled in the previous year. About 6 percent of college students report having a severe gambling disorder resulting in psychological difficulties, unmanageable debt, failing grades, all these bad things. Male students are even more likely to have gambled and they report  more problems with gambling more money and having gambling problems. And compared to students without gambling problems, these students are also more likely to use tobacco, to drink heavily, to binge-drink, smoke marijuana, use other illegal drugs, drive under the influence, have a low G.P.A. We shouldn’t at all pretend that gambling is completely victimless.  National Council on Problem Gambling  1 percent  MATHESON: There is not a uniform reporting of gambling across places. For example, at least officially, the numbers in the United States are something like 10 times higher than the numbers in Germany. Now the question is, is that because all Germans are very rational people who would never get themselves involved in this? Or do the Germans just have a much different definition of what you mean by problem gambling?  DUBNER: How much would you say that the median sports gambler operates on logic and all its manifestations versus emotion?  MATHESON: We know that they operate a ton on emotion. We talk about casinos balancing the books so that they make money either way. But casinos also do a pretty good job of following the dumb money.  DUBNER: So, Victor, you’ve told us about all the ways in which sports bettors are illogical and emotional and overconfident. So, let’s say I’m all of those, but I still want to bet, and I want to increase my chances a little bit. Do you have any advice for how to be a less terrible gambler?  MATHESON: Yeah, actually the one sports gamble that we know has a long-run payoff is actually betting on the horse races and betting heavy favorites to show. So, what that means is you’re taking a horse that everyone thinks is going to win the race, and you bet on them to at least come in no worse than third. It turns out that is a winning bet, dollar-wise.  DUBNER: That is so boring.  MATHESON: It is literally the most boring way to watch a horse race in the history of horse racing. But it makes money. It’s a gambling strategy only an economist could love.  ROBINS: You know, that’s not something we want — we’d like to build a big independent company. And what’s interesting about our space is that because of the regulatory aspects of it and because it’s state by state, it’s not going to be, all at once, this huge opportunity. The opportunity could take several years to get bigger and bigger. But I think you might see where some of the bigger companies are, like, “There’s a lot of regulatory stuff we’ve got to deal with.” So, that gives us a window, but that window is not open forever.  When we interviewed Jason Robins last year, DraftKings was still a privately held company, with a likely valuation in the single-digit billions. Robins didn’t sound like he was in any hurry to cash out.  ROBINS: I mean, we are growing really quickly now, and I think the opportunity we’re going after is one that has the potential to build a — people may not believe me now, but we’ll see in a few years. I think there could be a $100-billion-plus company built in this space. So, we’re going after that kind of size opportunity.  But in April of this year, DraftKings went public, at a market capitalization of around $6 billion. Since then?   .   Like a variety of other companies and sectors that have benefited from the pandemic shutdown, DraftKings and sports betting generally are    than you would have predicted just a year ago.  The first game in this year’s truncated Major League Baseball season, between the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals, attracted the most bets for a baseball game in DraftKings’ sportsbook history.  GETHERS: I’m glad you already interviewed somebody else who’s made money off this thing.   For this, he told me, he’d love to get his own billions of dollars someday. I asked where he expected those billions to come from.  GETHERS: Yeah, I don’t. That’s the problem.  DUBNER: Yeah.  GETHERS: Unless he wants to give me some.  DUBNER: What do you think would be an appropriate dowry?  GETHERS: A hundred bucks.   DUBNER: How many members were there of the original Rotisserie League?  GETHERS: Originally 12.  DUBNER: So, you’re saying for $1,200, Jason Robins could basically make all of you happy?   GETHERS: Well, it’s more than we’ve made up until now.
