Extensive research and development, for a start. Plus: Allusionist origin story!\\nBut first, a little word history, sponsored by \\nThe Great Courses Plus\\n. I’m desperate to slow down the atrophy of my brain, so I’m extremely happy to have the massive library of The Great Courses Plus video lectures on a huge range of subjects - history, psychology, food, travel, business, crime - and yes! Linguistics! Lots of treats for our kind, listeners. I’m getting stuck into \\nThe Secret Life of Words: English Words and Their Origins\\n - I’ve just been watching the installment called ‘Spinster, Bachelor, Guy, Dude’ which is about the influence of gender on language, and vice versa. It’s SO interesting. The series also covers slang, sports, the language of love, and gives an excellent grounding in the history of English and the many different processes that shape language. They’ve done my job for me. Come on in, listeners, the water’s lovely - and free, because The Great Courses Plus are giving you Allusionist listeners a month’s free trial of their service, so you can watch this course - or any of the thousands of other courses, whatever takes your fancy - gratis. Start your free month today at \\nthegreatcoursesplus.com/Allusion\\n. \\nAnd thanks to the Great Courses Plus, here’s the etymology of a word for which I feel a visceral revulsion, but I’ll be using it several times in the course of this episode, so I have to deal with it: 'trend'. When I was growing up, ‘trendy’ was one of the most cringe-inducing words, outside of the ones used in biology class. It has been retooled in recent years as ‘on trend’ but I see you, trendy, hiding in your new jacket. \\nGranted, ‘trendy’, coined in 1962, is currently not on trend, but several other forms of the word are. And I’ve been trying and so far failing to trace the past few years’ developments in the use of ‘trend’ and ‘trending’, to insinuate ‘a tide of online popularity’. That sense may not have been invented by Twitter, when it added the ‘trending topics’ feature in April 2009, but it certainly accelerated it.\\nGoing back in time, there are a few meanings of ‘trend’ - it’s an obscure English word for clean wool;\\xa0it’s a part of a ship’s anchor, as well as another nautical term for the angle made by the direction of the anchor line and the ship’s keel -\\xa0which is probably where, as of the late 19th century, ‘trend’ began to mean more generally the direction something was going. But before that, it was a geographical term: the curvature of mountains and hills and, earlier, of rivers and coastlines, because ‘trend’ is recorded in the 1590s as meaning the direction in which rivers ran and bent. It came from the Old English ‘trendan’, to roll around or revolve, which shares an ancient root with the Old English word ‘trinde’ that meant a round lump or ball. \\nSo think about that next time someone says something like, “Crop tops are so on trend.” Just balls.\\nOn with the show.\\nHZ: In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded a book retail company named ‘Cadabra’, as in ‘Abracadabra’. But his lawyer misheard it as ‘cadaver’, so instead, Bezos opted to call it \\nAmazon\\n. It’s the world’s biggest river by volume, matching Bezos’s ambitions for the company; and back then in 1995, lists of websites were often alphabetical, so starting with A was cunning; and it was not likely to be mistaken for a dead body. Which is a useful criterion when naming a company. Amongst others:\\nNANCY FRIEDMAN: The three golden rules: it has to be memorable, has to be pronounceable, has to be legally available. \\nHZ: This is Nancy Friedman, she's a name developer. \\nNF: A name developer creates names, taglines, for companies, products, organisations… I’ve done book titles occasionally. Things like that.\\nHZ: When you're launching or rebranding a company or a product, you might hire a name developer like Nancy to help ensure you ace the name. She'll do a ton of research on different options, checking they don't infringe trademarks, that they aren't already being used by a big company, that if the product will be available in foreign countries, its name will be pronounceable there. For one job, she might be working on hundreds of possible names. \\nNF: ..because you have to develop a lot of names to get one good name. Usually you’re aiming for three names. Then the lawyers take over. This is art, science, craft, and law - and a lot of psychology and salesmanship. Legal is the one that really gets us in trouble. I always advise a client not to choose a name a big company has some claim on. That’s just not a smart idea.\\nHZ: I feel a little chuckle in my soul every time I walk past my local private investigation agency, Finlay’s Bureau of Investigation. They go by FBI Ltd. FBI. \\nFBI\\n.\\xa0\\nEither they're cheekily attempting to pick up some runoff from the \\nother\\n FBI, or they didn't do much investigation into potential rivals for brand recognition. Or maybe they merely wanted to be able to say, when someone asks, “Where do you work?”\\n“I’m with the FBI.” \\n“Wow! Is it just like it is in all the films?”\\n“Not that FBI, the \\nother\\n\\xa0FBI.”\\n“What other FBI?”\\n“Oh come on, not this \\nagain\\n...”\\nNancy would \\nnot\\n overlook the existence of another FBI when developing a name. \\xa0\\nNF: The first step is gathering information. I used to be a journalist, and that’s where that comes in handy. I interview my client and whoever else is on the team; sometimes I’ve interviewed their clients. I’m trying to find out the brand personality, what the name needs to express, if they have any dos or don’ts - sometimes clients have these fixed ideas about what a name needs to be, we talk about that.\\nHZ: Are you often saving them from themselves?\\nNF: Oh...yes. Like I said, a lot of this is psychology, and I’m part therapist. There’s a lot that goes on. People get extremely emotional about names. They’ll get attached to a code name; they’ll have a very strong negative reaction to a name that evokes their childhood, eg their pet dog that died. There are artificial rules - I had a client tell me ⅔ through the process that we can’t have a name that ends in a vowel sound. For no particular reason; he had some instinctive negative reaction against names that end in vowels. “All successful brands end in a consonant.” I pointed out some exceptions.\\nHZ: Coca-Cola… Pepsi… IKEA… Toyota… Volvo… Hulu… If you wanted to make something of yourselves, you should’ve listened to that guy and put a 'K' on the end.\\nNF: Then there is the problem of the too large team, in which there’s a desperate attempt to arrive at consensus so no decision gets made. There’s the “My niece just told me she has a better name,” or “I was golfing one day and my golfing partner said, ‘Why don’t you try this name?’” - never having read the naming brief, which is an important first step. After the information-gathering, I write a detailed naming brief, and not using that naming brief for what it is meant for is a big pitfall. \\nHZ: My niece told me not to read the brief, so...\\nRead the brief, get the name right, and your brand might be sorted for decades. But that’s not necessarily what companies want.\\nNF: There are a lot of startups that aren’t branding for the long-term; they’re hoping to get bought. For them, the name is low priority.\\nHZ: And it shows. In some of the unimaginative names.\\nNF: They tend to go in herds, they follow trends. I have started creating Pinterest boards of naming trends. I’ve started seeing this with names that end ‘-ly’. I collected something like 280 of them. And I’m sure I missed many, but there’s Filterly. Flightly. Two companies called Boxly. Peercisely. \\nHZ: The -ly trend is showing no signs of slowing yet. And another suffix trend that has been going strong for several years already is ‘ify’. Globify. Eventify.\\nNF:\\xa0Playlistify.\\nHZ: Coworkify. Fluentify. \\nNF: Then there’s 8ify.\\nHZ: You can make \\nany\\n word into a verb, making your company sound active and dynamic. You can do it even if the word was already a verb!\\xa0Like ‘Explainify’.\\nNF: So they were all following - a colleague of mine has tracked this, Chris Johnson, the \\nName Inspector\\n - he tracked this all to the success of Spotify, which is a name created out of a mishearing.\\nHZ: Daniel Ek says his cofounder Martin Lorentzen shouted something from another room, which he misheard as ‘cadaver’. Sorry - ‘Spotify’. \\nNF: \\xa0So he thought it sounded great, and that’s what it is. Occasionally they’ve made up stories about meaning, but it has no meaning.\\nHZ: In a way that’s better - it only means Spotify.\\nNF: It only means Spotify...\\xa0So everybody leapt onto that bandwagon and thought if they could do it, we could do it.\\nHZ: It does seem to be the way that the ones with a new name do well, and the ones following the trend don’t do so well.\\nNF: Of course.\\nHZ: One long-lasting trend that now seems to be simmering down is removing the vowels from the last syllable of a word - Flickr and Tumblr have outlived the trend they spurred, but Twitter, which started out as Twittr, put the E back in a few months after they launched, when they were able to buy the twitter.com domain off the person who already owned it. Devowelution has often resulted from pragmatism. \\nNF: Tumblr is pretty old now - 12 years? They dropped the E just to get an available domain. Flickr, same thing. And it looks distinctive, and there was some inherent meaning. We’re seeing it less in a suffix; we’re seeing the dropping of \\nall \\nthe vowels now. There’s a company in San Francisco called Black Denim, BLKDNM.\\nHZ: It’s a risk - if you weren’t familiar with Black Denim, you might insert the wrong vowels. Bloke Dynamo. Balked Name. \\nNF: Yes, that is a liability. Like the vowels are the fat to be cut out; we’re getting to the meat of the name.\\nHZ: Except the vowels are like the journey you take between the consonants.\\nNF: They didn’t ask me. Clearly.\\nHZ: Are you pro-vowel?\\nNF: Yes. I like a good vowel. \\nHZ: I didn’t ask Nancy what she thought of 'The Allusionist', because at this stage it’s too late to do anything about it \\nif she thinks it’s no good\\n,\\n \\nand we already had enough trouble coming up with it, as you’ll hear right after this message from today’s sponsor,\\xa0\\nFallen London\\n, the text adventure game to which many of you have lost a lot of time, I gather. But you don’t seem at all sad about that. Because you get to roam around London that has been hidden a mile underground; it’s riddled with eccentric characters and talking tigers and squid-people, and your character can be pansexual and gender non-binary - so even though this is a version of Victorian London, in some ways it’s more progressive than the real present-day one. \\nYou can play Fallen London for free, but when you create an account at \\nfailbettergames.com/allusionist\\n, you’ll get some gifts that you can use in the game when you play it in your browser or the new Fallen London app.\\nBack to names. \\nHZ: There are a few things to consider when naming a podcast. \\nIs someone using the name already? That’s important: do your research; at the very least, go to the iTunes store and check.\\nIs the name such a common word or phrase that your show will not appear in the first thousand pages of Google results?\\nIs the name a riff on a pre-existing title, like That American Life, so no matter how successful your show gets, it will never completely be your own, and always a bit of a parasite on someone else's thing?\\nIs it a riff on ‘pod’ or ‘cast’? That was already stale when I was starting my first podcast nearly ten years ago. Resist the pod puns!\\nHere’s the story of how the name of this show came about. It’s autumn 2014, and I’m strolling with Radiotopia sovereign and \\n99% Invisible\\n host Roman Mars, suggesting to him that I make a podcast about language.\\nROMAN MARS: I remember walking around Crystal Palace park when it first started, and you originally - I can’t remember what the original name was.\\nHZ: The original name spawned the idea of the show. The phrase ‘word detective’ sprang into my head, so that was the working title. But you disliked that.\\nRM: I don’t know why I disliked it. It felt like the first thing you would think of. Which it was. I wanted something that would make the idea of searching for words a little more evocative, a little more poetic.\\nHZ: But then you supplied some suggestions, I don’t know if you recall those. They included Communique, Idiomatic, Phraseology and Semantic Drift.\\nRM: I liked ‘Idiomatic’, because I liked the idea of ‘idiot’, I guess, embedded in there. I thought if I saw Idiomatic, I would click on it. Semantic Drift was the one I was most infatuated with; or at least I’m projecting my current fascination with that one now. \\nHZ: To pass muster with Roman, the name of my show couldn’t be silly, but also it couldn’t be too serious, because I didn’t want to choke on my own sheepish laughter whenever I said it. Another obstacle is that a lot of people, less discerning than \\nyou\\n,\\xa0\\nstaunch listeners, assume that a show about language is going to be dry and hectoring about incorrect grammar, so the name had to be not-boring to counteract assumptions of boringness.\\nSo I asked my friends for their suggestions on Facebook. And the puns rolled in.\\nCunning Linguist\\nVowel Movements\\nThe Jargonauts\\nLinguistic Pizza - little tribute to Julia Roberts’s movie debut \\nMystic Pizza \\nthere...\\nComma Police\\nA Guy Called Gerund\\nBabel Bashing\\nSubtext Adventure - like 'text adventure', get it? No, nobody did.\\nDiphthongs are Forever\\nConsonancy Mitford\\nHigh Gloss - that’s a philology pun, not a fun one like a Guy Called Gerund.\\nDeath and Syntaxes\\nAdverb and the Ants.\\nActually some of these are amazing. Why didn't I choose them?\\nAnd then came the wordy suggestions. \\nWordplay. Word Up. Wordsmith - which was a pre-existing religious podcast. \\nA Whole New Word. \\nA lot of friends suggested the word ‘words’ as the title. That fails the googleable rule, for a start. \\nWord Nerds, which -\\xa0just because it rhymes doesn’t mean it’s right.\\nBut far too many people’s favourite option was the name ‘More Than Words’.\\n“Call it More than Words! It’s perfect, because then the theme tune could be \\nthe song of the same name by the band Extreme\\n!”\\n[clip: Extreme - ‘More Than Words\\nMore than words\\nIs all you have to do to make it real,\\nThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me,\\n'Cause I'd already know.\\n]\\nIf you’re not familiar with 'More Than Words' by Extreme, imagine a 1990 soft rock ballad version of the 17th century poem ‘\\nTo His Coy Mistress\\n’ by Andrew Marvell. If you’re not familiar with To His Coy Mistress OR Extreme, just imagine several minutes of pseudo-romantic sexual coercion. IT’S NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF MY WORK.\\nAlso this podcast isn’t ‘more than words’. It’s me using words to talk about words, it’s pretty much ONLY words. But I also didn’t want to call it \\nthat\\n, \\nbecause I didn’t want to open \\nthis\\n floodgate:\\n[clip: \\nBoyzone - 'Words\\n'\\nIt's only words\\nAnd words are all I have\\nTo take your heart away...\\n]\\nHZ: Fortunately, Roman stepped in and said:\\nRM: Any name with the word ‘word’ in it was an admission of defeat.\\nHZ: But why did you say there should not be ‘words’ in the title of a words show?\\nRM: I dunno, it’s too on the nose. If it’s the first thing you think of, it’s usually wrong, when it comes to names. It should be a little more mysterious.\\nHZ: You want the title to be more flirtatious.\\nRM: Yeah… Good titles are pretty universal, in the sense that they shouldn’t reference the subject too directly. My whole thing was, I couldn’t have ‘design’ in the name of my show. I was completely adamant that it not have the word ‘design’ in it. A show deserves better.\\nHZ: Roman surveyed a roomful of architects and designers, wanting to pick out some element of their process that he could turn into the name for his architecture and design show.\\nRM: At some point, someone mentioned, “If we’re doing a good job, it’s pretty much invisible.” And that’s how \\n99% Invisible\\n came to be.\\nHZ: Bam, job done, no need to rake through a verbal compost heap like we did for this show. Subtext. Upshot. Detectionary. Under the Tongue. Verbal Lint - I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean. \\nMind Your Language - which is also a 70s sitcom full of dodgy jokes about foreigners who can’t speak English properly; like I said, check the name isn’t already in use. \\nBy this point, there were more than 100 names being thrown around, and I hated them all. Naturally I turned to the thesaurus for solace. And a solution.\\nHZ: I remember the moment I thought up the word ‘Allusionist’. And I texted it to you even though you were pretty much in the same room.\\nRM: Yeah! I was in the back of the room.\\nHZ: We’re podcasters, why would we communicate face to face?\\nRoman’s text in response: “\\nYes yes yes yes\\n”.\\nHZ: Why did you like it?\\nRM: I liked it because it was both evocative, and an empty vessel which you could fill with your own personality, and the personality of the show. And it had a little bit of that 'Word Detective' - you were the one who was the guide.\\nHZ: The Allusionist sounds like a person. Or at least it did to my husband \\nMartin\\n, who started acting it out around the house. These antics spawned the theme tune.\\nMARTIN AUSTWICK: A word's in trouble? This sounds like a job for...The Allusionist! [\\nstrums theme tune\\n]\\nRM: It sounds like a detective theme to me a bit, so it was harkening back to that in my head. [sings]. It’s a bit Mission: Impossible. It has a good forward momentum. I really like it. It’s a good theme.\\nHZ: I imagine the Semantic Drift music would have been a lot more ambient.\\nRM: It would have been more like the tink-tink music that I like to talk over. \\n[Tink-tink music: melodium ‘i’ve been here before’]\\nHZ: This is Semantic Drift, in which I, Helen Zaltzman, keep a respectful distance from language...\\nOh, what could have been.\\nThe Allusionist is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX, a collective of the greatest podcasts on the interwaves.

Step over the threshold, and a doormat that says “L♥ve”. There are brocade sofas. Books suspended from the ceiling like a flock of birds. A one-eyed dog, Fitzwilliam Waffles. And bookshelves crowded with sports, vampires, regency, Victorian, erotica, shifters, Highlanders, historical fantasy, cowboy contemporary. This is \\nThe Ripped Bodice\\n, and it’s the only bookstore in the USA to sell exclusively romance books.\\nLEAH KOCH: \\nI\\'m Leah Koch and I\\'m one half of the owners of The Ripped Bodice. \\nBEA KOCH:\\n \\nI\\'m Bea Koch and I\\'m the other half of the sister duo.\\nHZ: Leah and Bea Koch are longtime fans of romance novels. Bea even wrote her graduate thesis on them. They opened The Ripped Bodice in March 2016. \\nBEA KOCH: \\nSo it kind of came out of both our love of romance, and the fact that there is no other romance bookstore in the United States. We also thought it would help bring legitimacy to the genre. So many other sub-genres have bookstores: comic bookstores, mystery bookstores, science fiction bookstores - and the one female-dominated genre did not have its own bookstore.\\nHZ: According to the Romance Writers of America, around 15% of readers are male. The Koch sisters estimate that, aside from any who might be writing under a female pseudonym, perhaps 5-10% of romance authors are male - although it is also often the case that a romantic novel written by a male author will be marketed as literary fiction rather than romance. Put a different cover on \\nOne Day \\nby David Nicholls and say it was written by, I don’t know, \\'Valerie Rose\\', and watch the respect for that book immediately evaporate. Romance readers often find themselves in a similar predicament.\\nLEAH KOCH: T\\nhere is a certain amount of defense in being a romance fan; if you\\'re going to be a vocal romance fan, unfortunately, you\\'re going to have to spend some of that time explaining to people why what you like is valid and why their opinion is stupid. \\nHZ:\\n \\nDo it. \\nLEAH KOCH: OK! The most basic response is: \"Why on Earth do you care what I am reading?\" \\nI never say that, but that is the honest question - it\\'s like, why do you care? I like it! But let\\'s get slightly more academic than that. \\nRomance is primarily written by women for women. Let\\'s not diminish the contributions of men, but let\\'s set them aside for a second. \\nIt\\'s a female-dominated genre. \\nBEA KOCH: \\nAnd historically it\\'s associated with a female readership, which is very important in the critical perception of the genre.\\nLEAH KOCH: Right. So it\\'s books where women\\'s thoughts, emotions, sexuality, take centre stage; and there\\'s a lot of other stuff that happens around it, you know, that\\'s what subgenres are. So it\\'s surrounded by carriages and dresses or surrounded by vampires and werewolves or surrounded by FBI guys on the run, whatever: that\\'s all secondary. The thing at the heart of it is a woman\\'s experience. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nMills and Boon, home of romance, books by women for women. And what better definition of feminism than by women for women, in terms of romantic fiction?\\nHZ: This is Lisa Milton, executive publisher of Harlequin, and as such, she is responsible for the notorious romance imprint \\nMills & Boon.\\n \\nLISA MILTON: \\n\\xa0\\nEveryone knows it. You\\'ve heard of it, I\\'ve heard of it. You go into the street and you ask anybody over the age of forty five: they\\'ve heard of Mills and Boon.\\nHZ: Even if you’ve never read one of their books, you might have an idea of what Mills & Boon represents: a quivering naive heroine, hair blowing in the sea breeze as her lantern-jawed lover, smelling faintly of the glistening chestnut stallion he just galloped in on, sweeps her up in his strong, sexually confident arms... That’s actually not the whole story with Mills & Boon at all. Throughout its history, the company has been a real innovator. It was ahead of the curve with ebooks, and with selling books outside of bookshops - we’re now used to supermarkets being big deals in book sales, but Mills & Boon was on the case decades earlier, distributing books at newsagents and petrol stations. And, of course, marketing books to women was an unusual tack for them to have taken. Albeit with somewhat cynical motivation. \\nLISA MILTON: We might have been by women for women, but it was a marketing conceit. This is some men who saw a way of making money out of women. \\nHZ: Gerald Rusgrove Mills and Charles Boon founded the company in 1908, but not to publish romances specifically.\\nLISA MILTON: It was traditional publisher. The intention was to be like any other trade publisher. They were based in London. They published Jack London; they published some academic texts -\\nHZ: They had PG Wodehouse.\\nLISA MILTON: They did have PG Wodehouse! It was fascinating. But what they realised in the 1930s is that there was in the UK a generation of women who were now working - they probably hadn\\'t worked before; previous generations hadn\\'t worked. \\nHZ: The other factor Mills & Boon recognised is that opportunities for real-life romance weren’t plentiful, because so many men had died in the First World War.\\nLISA MILTON: So there were many spinsters and there are many widows. And actually there was some money because these women were working but there wasn\\'t really any happiness; there wasn\\'t joy. And what they created were portable cheap romantic fiction novels, that were more like bookazines or magazines that you could consume in a weekend. And the idea was you\\'d get your wages at the end of the week, you\\'d buy a Mills & Boon; you\\'d read it over the weekend and you would escape your life, this grey life of going to work and not having your romantic relationship or your partner or not having the possibility of finding one. And it was very much boy meets girl, something happens, relationship doesn\\'t quite work, boy and girl separate, boy and girl come back together again happily ever after. And that grew every decade for years and years and years and years.\\nHZ: Every four seconds, someone in the world buys a Mills & Boon book. Each month, Mills & Boon publish ninety new novels in physical book format, and more than that number again in ebooks. They have some 1,500 authors around the globe, writing for the sixteen different Mills & Boon lines, such as Nocturne - paranormal and science fiction romance; Spice - Mills & Boon’s most sexual imprint…\\nLISA MILTON: \\n...\\nwe\\'ve got Historical; we\\'ve got Modern, which is the biggest series; we\\'ve got Cherish, which is babies and marriage. It\\'s babies and marriage but no sex. Because some people don\\'t want sex. \\nHZ: Although, a lot of readers DO want sex - sex with doctors is perennially popular.\\nLISA MILTON: \\nReally popular - it\\'s our third biggest series in the UK. So sex with a CEO comes first. Possibly a prince or a sheikh.\\nHZ:\\xa0\\n \\nSo CEO is the modern prince or sheikh?\\nLISA MILTON: \\nYeah. And billionaires. Billionaires galore. \\nHZ: I wonder whether the USA’s new president and his cabinet have taken the sheen off the billionaire fantasies… \\nLISA MILTON: \\nCertainly puts me off!\\n Yeah, it would be interesting to see how that evolves. \\nHZ: \\nIt\\'ll be Greenpeace activists; they\\'ll be the new romantic interest. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nThat would be so fabulous. \\nHZ: For now, as you probably noticed, fantasy favours jobs that are high status and high earning - but don’t forget the billionaires, the doctors, they can be the women in the story...\\nLISA MILTON: \\nT\\nhere was an assumption that the books were always about powerful men and women. That is not at all what our books are about: our heroines are feisty, they\\'re in control. They\\'re making the decisions. Yes, they want a sexy guy;\\n it’s very important \\nthese are women who are consenting to, enjoying and being very aware of their own sexuality, and that\\'s really empowering. That\\'s what our stories are: these are stories of women who know what they want, go out and get it and have it. \\nHZ: But it hasn’t always been this way. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nT\\nhe books definitely reflect their generation. The books reflect the times in which they are written and the books have evolved. When they started, there wasn\\'t any - shall we call it - action. The bedroom door would close and you wouldn\\'t see anything. You might have a heaving bosom and some sighs and a lengthy snog - probably wouldn\\'t be called a snog, it\\'d be called a kiss. \\nHZ: \\nAn osculation. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nExactly! \\nBut I think in the 70s, they were a difficult time and there are titles that were published then that I wouldn\\'t consider feminist, that in the 21st century are not appropriate at all. \\nHZ: During Mills & Boon’s long existence, women’s lives have changed considerably: in society, professionally, sexually. And the books reflect that. But it’s also the case that reading a romance from forty or fifty years ago - even twenty years ago - can be pretty problematic, if you apply present-day mores to what was considered normal at the time of writing - the female character being subordinate to men, say, or consent being reluctant or non-existent. \\nBEA KOCH: \\nWe try to be very upfront about the origins of this genre. We included it in our name: romance novels used to be called \\'bodice rippers\\', and it was a derogatory term to shunt them to the side. But we\\'re trying to reclaim the history of the genre. And those books were written in a different time, by women living in a different time. \\nLEAH KOCH: \\nNo. She\\'s dancing around it a little bit, but a lot of romance novels from the late 70s feature rape in some form between the hero and heroine - not, like, she gets raped and then goes and meets the true love of her life; but because that was the way that they could explore women\\'s sexuality. \\nY\\nes,\\n \\nromance really reflects the society at any given time. And we\\'re always looking for the books that are sex positive: that\\'s in our manifesto over on the wall. \\nHZ: Point two on the manifesto: “At The Ripped Bodice, we believe in being a sex positive, feminist business.”\\nLEAH KOCH: Especially in a big city, where we have such a diverse readership and customer base, \\nwe feel a responsibility to make sure that they are getting good information, especially our younger customers. We want to sell them books that are going to encourage a healthy view of sex and relationships. There are people who still write the slightly old school - \\nBEA KOCH: \\nIt\\'s called dubious consent. Dubcon. \\nIt\\'s not something that we read. We don\\'t really read dark romance, stuff that\\'s on the edge of that, because it\\'s not our particular cup of tea; but everything can\\'t be everyone\\'s cup of tea. We try to say \"Don\\'t yuck other people\\'s yum.\" Let people like what they like. However, we have a limited amount of space and we have to make editorial choices in this bookstore, and I think that\\'s what Leah\\'s getting at. If we have a certain shelf space, the books we want to sell are the ones that portray healthy relationships. \\nHZ: They also want to sell books that portray relationships that aren’t white gender-binary heterosexual couples. These are in short supply, but the ones The Ripped Bodice can get sell out fast. Publishers, take note.\\nBEA KOCH:\\n \\nIt\\'s totally realistic to read all about ice planet barbarians, but God forbid you read about two black people falling in love! I mean, come on publishing, get with the frickin programme! \\nLEAH KOCH: \\nIce Planet Barbarians\\n is a real book, by the way. \\nBEA KOCH:\\n \\nIt\\'s great. I\\'m not denigrating \\nIce Planet Barbarians\\n at all. It is thoroughly enjoyable. \\nLEAH KOCH: \\nI think the publishers that are going to do well in the next few years are the people who are listening to their readers. The people that can respond to the desperation for more representation are going to thrive.\\n The people that are starting to put out the books that people have been waiting for - we have seen such a growing demand for diversity in romance in all forms, whether it\\'s race, whether it\\'s sexual orientation - \\nBEA KOCH:\\n \\n- Couplings, nontraditional pairings, nontraditional heroines nontraditional heroes... \\nLEAH KOCH: \\nYeah, it\\'s so incredible to see a genre that we\\'ve loved for so long responding to the world as it is today. \\nHZ: And Mills & Boon just published its first novel featuring a protagonist who uses a wheelchair. But progress is slow; publishing still has a long way to go to offer better representation. But even if you’re not a publisher, you can push things forward. If there aren’t books which portray romance and sex and relationships the way you see them, get writing: romance is a genre where self-published authors have had great success. And Mills & Boon have an \\nopen submissions process\\n - you don\\'t need an agent, this is what you need:\\nLISA MILTON: \\nThere are a few things that Mills & Boon has to be: has to be great dialogue, has to be great sex and has to be happily ever after.\\nHZ: \\nSo no one can die at the end. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nNo you really can\\'t.\\n \\nHappily ever after is absolutely what we are. \\nHZ: Especially during these tumultuous times. Who needs fictional dystopias when you have the news?\\nLISA MILTON: Readers respond to events in a very honest and straightforward way, I think. And when times are great, you can read stories of misery and you can read stories of things not going well, and you can read stories with difficult endings or stories that don\\'t even end - the story ends but you want more. You can read those when times are good, because you as an individual are perhaps comfortable or confident, or you feel safe, might feel secure. When times are turbulent or difficult or you\\'re dealing with uncertainty, you have to find certainty in your reading; as readers we\\'re looking for fun, happiness, laughter, escapism. \\nHZ: Which is what romance novels are all about.\\nLEAH KOCH:\\n \\nI think the very simple answer is they make people happy. They make they\\'re fun to read. They\\'re fun. \\nBEA KOCH:\\n \\nWe try to have a good time with all of this. It\\'s supposed to be fun. That\\'s the whole point of this subgenre. It\\'s about being joyful. \\nHZ: The Ripped Bodice is a joyful place indeed; it’s a gorgeous shop. There’s every kind of romance novel your heart desires - including a stash of vintage Mills & Boons - and they run regular book signings and comedy nights and other events. Even if you can’t go to the store, you can get book recommendations every couple of weeks if you sign up to their mailing list. It’s all on their website, \\ntherippedbodicela.com\\n. Thanks to Bea and Leah Koch for appearing on the show - and to Lisa Milton from Mills & Boon. Visit \\nmillsandboon.co.uk\\n to order their books, join their book club, and submit that romance manuscript. Although, everyone says it’s much trickier to write one than you’d expect. Maybe because a lot of us have trouble putting sex and love into words?\\nLISA MILTON: I haven\\'t yet got the language of sex or romance; if I use the word \\'erotic\\' I think it\\'s a total turn off for everybody and I get that. But what are the words I\\'m going to use? That\\'s what I\\'m wrestling with.\\nHZ: \\nIt\\'s really difficult because the words tend to be too medical. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nYeah. shall we say them? \\nHZ:\\n \\nWell, the vagina word. \\nLISA MILTON:\\n \\nLabia. \\nHZ: \\nOr slangy, you know, deliberately ridiculous; or very much too florid. You have to find somewhere somewhere in the middle. \\nLISA MILTON: \\nAnd I haven\\'t found it yet. \\nHZ: \\nIt\\'s a lifetime\\'s work. \\nLISA MILTON:\\n \\nIt is. And I\\'m not going to give up till I\\'ve found it.\\nHZ: This is what I’ll be trying to find in the next episode. I can’t promise that I won’t give up before I cringe so hard I sprain every joint in my body. \\nThe Allusionist is supported by \\nBlue Apron\\n, the ingredient and recipe delivery service - Blue Apron plans your meal, sources sustainable fresh ingredients, packs just the right amount of them into a refrigerated box along with a step-by-step recipe card, and drops it off at your house.

One that makes me laugh whilst simultaneously chilling me to the marrow is \\nBenjamen Walker’s Theory of Everything\\n. Last summer, Benjamen visited me in London, and because you can rely on me to show you all the top tourist sights, I took Benjamen into University College London to see the preserved corpse of Jeremy Bentham, the late 18th early 19th century social reformer who conceived the panopticon prison. And I was not expecting this result at all, but in front of the corpse of Jeremy Bentham, Benjamen Walker was a man transformed! I was just trying to kill some time before we went for dinner, whereas Benjamen was conjuring up a multi-episode series about surveillance. It is nearing completion; there are several episodes out already, which like all Benjamen’s work are witty and weird and could have sprung from no other brain but his.

       "  \"Visit \\ntheallusionist.org/smalltalk\\n to hear or read about this episode.\\nThis is the Allusionist, in which I, Helen Zaltzman, bite down on language to \\nstifle my own screams of despair\\n.\\nToday’s show is about one of the things we do to avoid talking about politics: small talk! How words attempt to bridge the gap between one of us skinsacks and another. \\nLet’s prepare ourselves with a little word history, sponsored by \\nThe Great Courses Plus\\n, video lectures to renovate your mind. Want to brush up on a foreign language, or give yourself a grounding in gardening or art or paediatric medicine? All these subjects and many more await you in the Great Courses Plus’s extensive library.

You can join me watching these or stream any of the Great Courses Plus lectures for free - get the offer at \\nthegreatcoursesplus.com/Allusion\\n.\\nThanks to the Great Courses Plus, here’s the etymology of conversation. The word has had its current meaning of ‘talk’ since the 1570s; prior to that, ‘living with’ or ‘keeping company with’, which goes back as far as Latin, where it originated from ‘com vertare’, literally ‘to turn about with’ - giving the impression that the Ancient Romans chatted while do-se-doing. \\nIn the Bible, ‘conversation’ was more likely to mean someone’s social relationships, their place within their community. But, from at least the early 16th century, ‘conversation’ was also a euphemism for sex. And ‘criminal conversation’ was a legal term for adultery. It’s still in use in some places now, but in England, at the peak of such cases in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, husbands who brought criminal conversation lawsuits against their wives or their wives’ lovers could win damages equivalent to £10m-20m in present-day money. Per act of adultery! Good earner, if you were the husband. Nothing for you, Georgian-era ladies.\\nIt’s not that kind of conversation we’re talking about today, though.\\n On with the show.\\nHZ: How are you?\\nBENJAMEN: How am I? Look at me, I’m a wreck. I’m in pain, I’m not feeling well… I just want to watch \\nGame of Thrones\\n and fall asleep.\\nHZ: No!! you’re not actually supposed to give a truthful response to the question “How are you?” Unless it's your doctor asking.\\nHZ: Hi!\\nISY: Hi!\\nHZ: How are you?\\nISY: I’m wearing trousers that are kind of digging into my bum in a weird way. They’re a cross between leggings and jeans -\\nHZ: - \\njeggings\\n -\\nISY: Yeah. And they’re partly falling down and partly digging in, which is quite a strange combination.\\nHZ: Well great, now I’m all too aware of the state of her bumcrack. But if I didn’t want to know how she is, why did I even ask?\\nBecause that’s what we do, isn’t it?\\n That is how conversations so often begin. And nearly every time, this is how it goes:\\nHow are you?\\nFine thanks, and you?\\nOh, fine.\\nIt's not informative, so why bother? It's an exchange that indicates a conversation is being initiated. It's small talk: safe, trivial - small. \\nHZ: The challenge is just to have the longest conversation we can in small talk.\\nELEANOR: Ok!\\nHZ: You have to start.\\nELEANOR: It’s nice weather out today.\\n..\\nHZ: Weather. \\nClassic\\n start. Of course nobody \\nneeds\\n to know each other’s perception of the same weather, but in Britain you can experience blazing sunshine and an icy gale within ten minutes, so there’s always something to talk about, even if neither of you care.\\nELEANOR\\n: ...It’s still cold at night. Going to be warming up soon.\\nHZ: Unless the apocalypse comes.\\nELEANOR: It probably will warm up when the apocalypse comes.\\nHZ: Unless it’s a new ice age or something.\\nHZ: I blew it. Let's try again. \\nDAVE: The weather today was variable.\\nHZ: It was quite bright when we woke up, then it rained.\\nDAVE: I saw some hail.\\nHZ: Really? That was a good get.\\nDAVE: Absolutely, yeah. It was an interesting weather to experience.\\nHZ: Did you have a good day?\\nDAVE: Yes. There was a lot of variety in my feelings about the day.\\nHZ: I feel now you’re veering already into something too intimate, because you’re talking about your feelings.\\nDAVE: I’m trying not to go into anything!\\nHZ: You should just say, “Yeah, it was fine. Not bad.” Otherwise you’re giving me an in into your psyche.\\nDAVE: I’m not very good at this already.\\nHZ: But what IS being good at small talk? Is it the ability to keep a light conversation going for as long as possible without ever touching on any matters of substance, or is it being able to move from small talk to big talk very swiftly? You and the person you're small talking with might not have the same expectations or objectives.\\nDEVON: How would you define small talk?\\nMICHAEL: Errr… conversational foreplay! [laughs]\\nHZ: Saucy! Building up to the good stuff!\\nHZ: What do you think constitutes it?\\nMATTHEW: Constitutes small talk? Talk I wouldn’t otherwise have with a friend. \\nHZ: Yes, with friends you can usually skip the small talk and go straight to familiar territory. The small talk is for minor acquaintances and strangers.\\nMC: It’s a good device for keeping strangers at exactly the kind of length I like to keep them, which is further than my arms.\\nHZ: So it’s conversational arms?\\n \\nMC: Conversational arms! But, Go Go Gadget arms. \\nHZ: Those Go Go Gadget arms might keep you at a great distance, or bring you in for a hug. You gauge which with a series of microscopic negotiations in the form of light conversation.\\nYou might spend far more time\\n \\ntalking \\nabout the weather than actually\\n \\ncaring \\nabout the weather, but you’re remarking on a shared experience that is unlikely to cause offence or an argument, gently cluing you in on where to go next with the discourse. \\nMATT: In a party situation, it’s always, “How do you know these people?”\\nELEANOR: I’ll do a visual comment. If they’ve got a dress I like - even if they’ve got a dress I don’t like.\\nHZ: “You’ve got a dress on.”\\nELEANOR: “That’s a hat.” It’s very literal. Or if we’ve gathered for a particular thing or person, we can comment on the thing or person. If we’ve all seen a film, we can say, “What did you think about that film, huh?”\\nHZ: And if they’re like, “It’s alright,” then where do you go?\\nELEANOR: Maybe somewhere topical. “How do you like them Oscars?”, maybe.\\nHZ: That’s not going to work in September.\\nELEANOR: What’s the big awards in September?\\nHZ: Emmys?\\nELEANOR:I don’t follow the Emmys.\\nHZ: When’s the Nobel Prize?\\nELEANOR: ...I’m not on top of that.\\nHZ: You need a prize calendar.\\nELEANOR: I do need a prize calendar.\\nHZ: Whatever it takes to avoid an awkward silence, right? Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance, or whatever.\\nThe choice of topic isn’t the only thing to consider.\\nAMY: It’s not just about opinion, it’s about the length of time you’re expected to talk as well. So the length of the lift journey, or the length of the two-minute conversation on the street, so you can only ask questions for the length of response.\\n But it’s rude to ask someone something where the answer could be longer than the journey.\\nMARTIN: “Isn’t it wet today?”\\nSAM: “Yes, it is really wet today.”\\nMARTIN: “What is your greatest fear?”\\nSAM: “Sorry, I’m getting off at this floor.”\\nHZ: But why dance around each other with these insignificant chats? If you’ve only got a couple of minutes with that person, you \\ncould\\n risk an awkward outcome and go for something more revealing: “What is your greatest disappointment?” “Which do you fear more: dying before your time or a lengthy undignified decline?” “If you weren’t related to them, would you stay in contact with your family members?”\\n But…\\nAMY: Because I try to get into it straight away, they back right off it, back towards small talk. And they’re baffled that I tried to talk about something of substance in a short space of time.\\nHZ: Or perhaps not baffled, just scared, or unprepared?\\nAVERY: To understand who someone is and how to get to that place, you have to know how they’re doing today; what they do for a living. To touch base and set up a rapport first.\\nHZ: So what you’re saying is it creates an equality between the people in the conversation. If you do the small talk, you can establish the level the conversation’s going to be on.\\nAVERY: Yeah. If you want to have a substantive conversation, this is a way of assessing where their brain is coming from.\\nI’ve never understood the people who are like, “I HATE small talk, I DON’T GET it, I don’t tolerate it, I want to have REAL conversations with people. I\\nt’s a fundamental way that people care about each other. Even if it’s talking about the weather, assuring did you have a nice day, did you get caught in the rain - when I see someone making an effort to produce small talk, and really bothering to ask questions, and really trying to connect with you, it’s so meaningful, it means a lot.\\nHZ: So the information you’re exchanging might not be particularly meaningful, but the fact you \\nare exchanging it is. And, if it works, the small talk is the launchpad for a deeper conversation. Or, at least a more lively conversation:\\nMAE: When you meet someone from New Jersey, the common opener is, “What exit?” As in what exit off the turnpike. I was exit 4. Which I learned specifically because so many people asked me.\\nHZ: Were people divided into very specific numerical factions?\\nMAE: Yeah, well 4, we’re really down near the South Jersey then if you’re up at 11 or 12, you’re in the North Jersey end, and some people are practically New York, and NJ is tiny, but it’s very divided.\\nHZ: If someone said, “What exit?” and you said, “4”, would that lead to anything? Or is that the conversation killed?\\nMAE: If they were an exit near you, you could say, “Which shore did you go to - LBI or Ocean City or Wildwood?” Wildwood is kind of trashy. Long Beach Island was the one that was closest and smallest, then Ocean City was the one that was dry - no alcohol - so it was more families, and was a little nicer. So you could evaluate the person’s life depending on what they said, and what period of time you went there.\\xa0 \\nHZ: So what you’re doing is establishing a common experience, and then you can advance the discourse.\\nMAE: And you could talk about, “What’s your favourite pizza place in this area?” and now people talk about how close they lived to where \\nThe Sopranos\\n may have taken place… There were stories when I was a kid of people being buried in the woods. The Mob. They’d found somebody. So people would say, “How close were you?”\\nHZ: Once you’ve got onto, “How close were you to a crime scene?” that’s getting quite good.\\nMAE: Yeah, it does get a little better!\\nHZ: From a number, which is boring; to a beach; to pizza, which most people can muster an opinion about; to murder. Four steps. Brilliant. New Jersey, you nailed small talk.\\nWe who live elsewhere, without shores or Sopranos, just have to keep going until we find our way in.\\nMATTHEW: In a conversation, you want to keep the person talking until you start talking about something that actually is interesting, which doesn’t necessarily have to be common ground, just something they’re passionate about that you’d want to hear.\\nHZ: I’m curious as to what the bridge is from small talk to something meaningful. Because I feel there are people I’ve know for years and I still never found that bridge. And it’s not that I don’t like them; I just can’t find it.\\nMATTHEW: I think that’s all my male friends. I’ve got friends I’ve had for ten years - don’t know if they’ve got a girlfriend, don’t know anything about them.\\nHZ: Are you not curious?\\nMATTHEW: No! None of my business!\\nHZ: So what do you talk about? You’re not into sport, so you don’t have that fallback.\\nMATTHEW: We just gaze longingly into each other’s eyes. That’s why I don’t want to know about their girlfriends. \\nThis episode was sponsored by \\nPoo Pourri\\n, \\nthe before-you-go bathroom spray that you spritz into the toilet bowl prior to commencing operations, and its essential oils trap your earthy human stench beneath the surface of the water, fooling everyone into believing you excrete such elegant concoctions as rose and geranium, cedarwood and eucalyptus or lemon, bergamot and lemongrass - I would drink that one.

But the region is not named after\\n the polar bears, but because of the Great Bear and Little Bear, the constellations that are always in the night skies of the Northern Hemisphere. The brightest star in Little Bear is Polaris, the North Star and, for the last thousand years or so, the Pole Star, as it appears to be stationary above the North Pole. So, that which was northerly was, in Ancient Greek, ‘ἀρκτικός’ - near the bear. Thus\\n the region up at the top of the world near the bear got its appellation, 'Arctic'. 'Antarctica' is simply a contraction of\\n \\n‘anti Arctic’, as it is at the opposite side of the globe to the Arctic. And, of course, it is bear-free.\\nQuick note before we begin: if you visit \\ntheallusionist.org/transcripts\\n, you’ll find episode transcripts, which are helpful when the audio is a little unclear, as it is in places today. I think you’ll understand why, given the location of some of the guests. On with the show.\\nHZ: Where are you speaking to me from right now?\\nAMY LOWITZ: The geographic South Pole.\\nHZ: If it weren’t dark outside, Amy Lowitz could look out the window and see the actual South Pole marker.\\nAL: I’m here at the South Pole, working for the University of Chicago on the South Pole telescope as a winter telescope operator.\\nCHRISTINE MORAN: I’m Christine Moran ... I’m on one year leave to operate the South Pole telescope down here at the South Pole and Antarctica with Amy Lowitz.\\nHZ: And when did you last see daylight?\\nAL: [laughs]\\nCM: April,-ish? I think at least 3-4 months of total darkness, or close to it.\\nHZ: And a few weeks after the sunlight disappears for the last time before the totally dark months of Antarctic winter, something odd starts to occur. People start to forget - what was it? ...Words! And they drift off without finishing their...uh...\\nALLISON BARDEN: It happens! It happens.\\nHZ: ...Sentences! \\nThis is Allison Barden, also known as Sandwich. She did a variety of jobs in Antarctica on and off for ten years, summers and winters.\\nAB: Just from personal experience... sometimes you just stare off into space, or stop sentences in the middle of them, and forget what you were talking about. Or sometimes you lose the word for a common thing, and you... slow down a little.\\nAL: I’m definitely more prone to being spacey, more prone to occasionally losing words or not being able to come up with the exact precise word that I wanted.\\nAB: People are pretty supportive of each other. “Yep, I get it. Forgot what you were saying? Yep, I’ve been there.” And it becomes part of your communication; you just start to understand, yep, that’s how it is.\\nHZ: This phenomenon is known locally as ‘getting toasty’.\\nAL: So ‘toasty’ is sort of an Antarctica slang term that refers to all of the mental and personality changes that happen when you’ve been trapped in the Antarctic polar darkness for a little too long.\\nHZ: So if someone’s being a little cranky then you could say they are being ‘toasty’.\\nAL: Or if someone walks into a room and can’t remember why they’re there or can’t come up with a word or does anything a bit mentally silly and out of character, you might accuse them of being ‘toasty’.\\nCM: Or you might use it as an excuse for why you were late or slept in or forgot a meeting.\\nAL: So I think the medical term mainly encompasses what people mean by toasty is T3 syndrome or Polar T3 Syndrome.\\nHZ: The altered thyroid function that is Polar T3 Syndrome is one possible explanation for toasty behaviour.\\nTOM BARANSKI: It’s not a well studied and well described phenomenon.\\nHZ: Tom Baranski is an endocrinologist.\\nTB: An endocrinologist is a physician who treats hormone diseases, like diseases of the pituitary, or the thyroid, or the adrenal gland. The most common one is diabetes.\\n It is oftentimes the case that people who have problems with the thyroid describe fuzzy thinking or brain fog. Brain fog is the term I hear.\\nWhat Polar T3 is: they followed some relatively young, healthy men, who were going to be stationed in Antarctica, they did some studies on their thyroid hormone function before they went to Antarctica, then after six weeks in Antarctica. What they discovered was that when these men were in Antarctica, their bodies changed the way that they make one of the hormones, T3 - our thyroid makes two different types, T3 and T4. T3 is the more biologically active one. And it increased the total amount of T3 that was made. We don’t know \\nwhy\\n the body would do this. It’s probably an adaptation to the exposure to the cold conditions; and the T3 is the signal to generate more heat.\\nHZ: Ah, so the Antarctic \\ndarkness\\n might not be to blame for the toastiness?\\nAL: Right, and even in places where it’s not dark, you see T3 syndrome where it’s especially cold, regardless of darkness.\\nHZ: The day I spoke to Amy and Christine, the temperature outside at the South Pole with wind chill was -76.7 degrees Celsius, -106 Fahrenheit. Another factor is the altitude.\\nAL: Because that’s another thing - here is we’re at 9300ft of altitude, so we’re also functioning on a lot less oxygen than might be ideal.\\nHZ: But the altitude, the temperature and the darkness might not be the main culprits either.\\nTB: My guess is there are many other factors: being in a dark environment, crowded environment, sequestered away, may have effects on psychiatric function that may present with difficulty forming words or difficulty thinking.\\nHZ: Yes, if you’re one of the skeleton crew that stays through the winter at the handful of year-round Antarctic bases, you can’t really get out or go very far. And your social circle is pretty limited.\\nAB: You don’t see any new people; you’re with the same people for months at a time, there are no planes in or out, there’s no new anything. It’s the same buildings, the same work schedule, same people. I wonder how that affects us.\\nHZ: Sandwich spent some winters at the biggest base on Antarctica, McMurdo Station, home to more than 1,000 workers over the summer, not counting the stream of tourists and visitors. But over the winter, there are only 150 people living there. And right now, at the South Pole, including Christine and Amy, there are 46 people.\\nCM: Of course, anyone in an isolated environment undergoes some personality changes.\\n.. We don’t have much to talk about because the weather’s the same everyday. There’s no traffic here, no lines, there’s nothing to complain about, other than the stuff that we’ve already complained about in the past.\\n \\nAnd also you’ve told most of the same stories before and there’s only so much personal life you can say that hasn’t been said before. People also have less of a high standard of social interaction. So I feel like some of the conversations that you have where you lose words or maybe sound a little weird are just a product of there being \\xa0only 46 people here.\\nHZ: So perhaps toastiness is just cabin fever, and it’s not the fault of the thyroid at all.\\nTB: If you get on the internet and type in ‘stop the madness thyroid’, there’s an unbelievable number of sites that will blame any symptom on thyroid hormone metabolism. Unfortunately, all too often it has nothing to do with your thyroid; but people want to blame thyroid and thyroid hormone.\\nHZ Exonerate the thyroid! So, to sum up: not many studies have been done on toastiness and Polar T3 Syndrome, and it's not known what causes it. Luckily, it isn’t incurable.\\nAB: It’s pretty short term; I don’t feel it’s done permanent damage or dangerous detrimental damage. It’s just some anecdotal thing people notice.\\nHZ: Provided you haven't completely lost all verbal abilities during the dark months, another thing happens in the Antarctic stations which is common in small or isolated societies: new vocabulary.\\nAB: It’s kind of got its own language in a way. It’s very layered. To talk about it, it’s one of those things you have to explain to get the joke. Most Antarcticans understand it when they assimilate back into civilian life; you have to explain, go back a couple of steps, explain why that’s funny or why that happened.\\nHZ: Guess you had to be there, if you want to understand such slang terms as toasty, and ‘fingee’ - that’s someone who’s new to Antarctica, or ‘boondoggle’, a little jaunt away from your station, or -\\nAL: Consistent with T3 syndrome, we’ve forgotten the words! [they laugh]\\nAB: For example, the ice. It’s called ‘the ice’. And the first time you hear it referred to as ‘the ice’, people chuckle, they think that’s cute. By that time, you’ve already forgotten it’s a novelty. But it’s one syllable, rather than ‘Antarctica’; it’s kind of hard to say, it doesn’t flow in a sentence so well. But you say, “How many times have you been to the ice? I’m going back to the ice in October.” That’s everybody’s common referent for it, at least in the American program.\\nCM: I tend to - and I’ve heard other people do it as well - call anywhere that is not Antarctica 'the real world’.\\nHZ: Within Antarctica, it's none too surprising that many places are named after explorers - Scott, Shackleton, Amundsen for example - and monarchs, because they always get a piece of that action. But not all place names are enshrined in the Atlas... Yet.\\nAB: Things get very localized there. Even at McMurdo, there’s a feature that’s a place people know called Sausage Point.\\nHZ: Beneath the surface of Antarctica are buried many remnants from past Antarctic expeditions. A few years ago, staff were drilling to prepare a site for a new building, and a foul substance started squirting out of the ground. It was several tons of rotten sausage.\\nAB: And everybody called it Sausage Point after that.\\nHZ: And, of course, special terms are coined because people need to express concepts and items which aren’t in the lexicon of warmer countries. ‘Bergy seltzer’ - the sound of air trapped in an iceberg being released as it melts. ‘Snotsicle’, frozen snot. And when excrement dropped upon excrement freezes into a big stalagmite, that's a ’poonicorn’.\\nAL: I've heard the term 'ice wife' or 'ice husband' which is where a relationship... what happens on the ice stays on the ice. The concept of, regardless of whether one or both members of the partnership has significant others back home, it's understood that the relationship, however close it may be while you’re in Antarctica or however serious it may be while you're in Antarctica, it does not exist once you are off the ice, so I think that's what's meant by the idea of ice wife or ice husband.\\nHZ: There’s more workaday slang too.\\nCM: Our jackets are called ‘Big Reds’ because they’re very large and red. \\nAL: There’s Little Red, the smaller, less insulated version of Big Red.\\nCM: Yeah, there’re a lot of terms related to our clothing, extreme cold weather gear.\\nAL: It's very important!\\nHZ: One term that refers to clothing and sundry other items is ‘skua’. A skua is a type of Antarctic gull with a reputation for brazenly grabbing whatever it wants.\\nCM: But in the slang context it refers to where we put used items that we no longer want but could still be useful to someone else.\\n \\nHZ: So if you lost your hat or ran out of shampoo, you’d go and rummage in the skua closet or skua pile.\\nCM: It can also be a verb: “Amy, you should skua that shirt..”\\nAL: So that means if you tell someone to skua something it means they should put it in skua because it’s not worth keeping.\\nCM: (It’s actually quite a nice shirt she’s wearing\\n.)\\nAL: Thank you.\\nAB: We have a lot of military slang that’s been adopted as well, because the US military has had a presence on the ice since the late 20s. So we get a lot of language from the military; we get a lot of language from New Zealand, because McMurdo and South Pole operations are based out of Christchurch.\\nHZ: And there are linguistic reminders that the first permanent Antarctic stations were operated by the navy to start with.\\nAL: For example, our sleeping rooms are called ‘berthings’, much like on a ship. The cafeteria is called the galley. There are even architectural hints of it - a lot of doors will have a little window on them, a lot of those here are round, so they look like portholes. They’ve even made nods to that history in the architecture of the building.\\nHZ: Amy and Christine are a couple of months away from the end of their year at the South Pole. After ten years on and off in Antarctica, Sandwich works in the Bay Area at present.\\nAB: And if you talk about things you had in your recent jobs - well, my recent jobs were Antarctica, and it’s very unique situation, so if you start to explain it, I call it ‘Dropping the A-bomb’, because it takes over the whole conversation. “Whaaat? You were in Antarctica?”\\nThanks so much to today’s guests: Sandwich, or as her mother knows her, Allison Barden, who told me about all this in the first place; endocrinologist Tom Baranski; and Amy Lowitz and Christine Moran.

Not because he suddenly realised who his boss would be; but because he is opposed to the word ‘vice’ on religious grounds. The Bible prohibits vice, in the sense of immorality and wickedness, and this has got Mike Pence in a spin: “That’s not who I am, and that’s not who I want people to think I am,” he said. “I can’t in good faith willingly condone a word I find deplorable without violating my Christian principles.”\\nWell, Mike Pence, let the dictionary be your spiritual saviour. ‘Vice’ is what is known as a homonym. Homonym: a word that looks and sounds like another word, but has a different meaning. Now, calm yourself down and think about it for just a moment: if ‘vice president’ had the meaning you, Mike Pence, think it does, it would mean you were in the running to be the president of depravity and naughtiness. So if you really thought that, Mike Pence, firstly, haven’t you been questioning what the other guy is doing there, and secondly, if you do have a problem with it, shouldn’t you have raised an objection \\nbefore\\n you accepted the position two months ago?\\nThe ‘vice’ you’re worried about descends from the Latin ‘vitium’, a blemish either moral or physical, from the Proto-Indo-European ‘wi-tio’, fault or guilt. But, happily for you, ‘vice-president’ does not bear this etymological stain. It’s also not to do with the type of ‘vice’ that clamps carpentry projects together, which is from the Old French ‘vis’, a screw - no, Mike Pence, settle down! - that is from the Latin ‘vitis’, a vine or curly tendril, which spirals like a screw.\\nThe vice-presidential version of ‘vice’ is from yet another Latin word: ‘vicis’, a change or succession, which gave the idea of being a substitute or deputy.\\nI’m glad to be able to put your mind at rest about this, Mike Pence, because I think you have more pressing things to be worrying about. \\nUPDATE: Since this episode was released, it has come to my attention that reports of Mike Pence objecting to the word ‘vice’ on hononymous grounds are FALSE. The etymology still stands. But listener Ryan, I can never trust you again.\\nOn with the show.\\nIn the last episode, the Rosetta Stone\\n provided the key to hieroglyphics, by presenting them in parallel with Greek which enabled them to be deciphered. But languages aren’t designed to be deciphered. They were never supposed to be incomprehensible in the first place.\\nIRVING FINKEL: Undeciphered: it\\'s a temporary state, in my opinion; I look at it optimistically, with the general guiding rule that anything that anybody over any period of time wrote should be decipherable by somebody else.\\nHZ: Irving Finkel is a curator in the Middle East department of the British Museum.\\nIF: The fact is that none of the world\\'s writing systems apart from codes are meant to be obscure. And this is crucial. Normal writing systems that we can\\'t read just because we haven\\'t deciphered them doesn\\'t mean that they indecipherable; it means that we haven\\'t done it. The fact is we haven\\'t done it depends on various things. Sometimes it\\'s a matter of extreme rarity, so there\\'s hardly anything to go on; and sometimes it\\'s a matter of a profusion of inscriptions which are all too short to be diagnostic.\\nHZ: All that remains of some languages is the ancient equivalent of a few ‘No Parking’ signs. Or sometimes lists of names - but trying to deduce a language from those would be like trying to figure out the whole of English from a phone book.\\nThere’s also the issue of the evidence being mostly whatever was written on durable materials, which skews the known vocabulary of that language towards the official and formal. Paper or leaves or skins are less likely to have survived time and climates than stone or clay or ivory or tombs, but those aren’t usually materials people would use for everyday jottings.\\nNICK ZAIR: One problem is that you don\\'t have a wide range, if you\\'re looking at the lexicon, of what words exist in this language. If you want to learn how to say happy birthday, tough, because that kind of stuff doesn\\'t doesn\\'t survive.\\nHZ: Classicist Nick Zair has spent years working on translating the language of Oscan, which for several centuries was spoken all over southern Italy, but by around zero BC, it had died out.\\nNZ: But we\\'re very well up on official terminology for approving things and commissioning, things for example.\\nHZ: \\xa0It\\'s like if in two thousand years’ time, people went back and the only sources they had for 21st century English were council documents about planning permission.\\nNZ: Yeah, exactly so. And maybe some graffiti. That’s another thing actually - graffiti written on walls.\\nHZ: How similar is that to modern graffiti where you wouldn\\'t necessarily get a good grammatical phrase?\\nNZ: It\\'s quite interesting, in a sense that, if all you had to go on was British graffiti, you would actually get a different lexicon. You might very well get things that are grammatical. They\\'re not polite English; they\\'re not correct standard English; but you\\'d learn something about the way people spoke on an everyday level perhaps. But it\\'s also very easy to get carried away with that and assume you know - actually anything that\\'s written down by definition not the same as speech and by definition isn\\'t everyday, especially in a culture where illiteracy is much greater. You must have had some education to be literate.\\nHZ: So, again, the known vocabulary is not going to reflect the whole populace and how they used the language.\\n Also, bear in mind that the 2,000-year-old graffiti Nick is talking about includes stuff we wouldn’t necessarily think of as graffiti now - there was quite a lot of business painted on walls, like electoral posters and official notices.\\nNZ: But actually in the ancient world, the equivalent of those kind of “Polite notice: please don\\'t park outside here” is written on the wall as well. There\\'s more or less no kind of public signage. There isn\\'t a public body who goes around putting speed limit signs up and saying this is such and such road.\\nHZ: People have been studying Oscan for about 250 years so far, and considering they can’t exactly run it through Google Translate, they’ve made quite good progress understanding it.\\nNZ: The reason we can understand Oscan fairly well is because it was related to Latin. So, in the same way that Romanian and French, Spanish, Italian, are all related to each other, if you found another language all of a sudden in that family, you could have a reasonably good stab at understanding quite a lot of it. But sometimes we just come across things and we go, “We’ve got no idea what this is.”\\nHZ: How do you feel when you come up against an Oscan word you cannot crack? Determined? Frustrated?\\nNZ: Yeah.\\nHZ: What sort of size of lexicon do you have in Oscan?\\nNZ: Not huge. It\\'s really dependent on what\\'s on what\\'s been preserved for us so we\\'re pretty good on the names of gods; institutional vocabulary is quite good, things like magistracies, that sort of thing. We know how to sign something or to mark it because - this is actually a really lovely find - there is a quite a large roof tile that\\'s been found that has four sets of footprints on it, two left and two right, as if someone has just walked across it. On one side it says in Latin, “The girlfriend of Horennius marked this or signed this with her foot while we were putting out the the tiles,” and it says more or less the same thing on the other side in Oscan, so we know the verb ‘to walk on someone\\'s tile and an imprint in the cement’.\\nHZ: Egyptian got the Rosetta Stone; Oscan just has a tile with feet on it.\\nNZ: That\\'s an interesting case because in Latin it says ‘the girlfriend of Horennius’; in Oscan it says ‘the debt-free of Horennius’. And we just don\\'t know what this word means. It doesn\\'t even look like a very good Oscan word. You\\'d expect it to have a different ending. And we don\\'t know what it means - is it her name? Does it means slave girl? Does it mean ‘girlfriend’? We just don\\'t know what it means.\\nHZ: Could it be bawdy slang for ‘girlfriend’?\\nNZ: It could be. It could it could really be anything.\\nHZ: This is the trouble when translating an extinct language. You can make educated guesses based on similar languages. You can study the samples of writing to find patterns that are clues to what the words might mean and how the grammar might have worked. But then you can discover something that doesn’t fit in with what you thought you knew - and you’re at a loss to understand it.\\nNZ: What really helps is when you have, like the Rosetta Stone, where you have a language you don\\'t know, or a writing system you don’t know, that\\'s translated into another language that says exactly the same thing. So that\\'s a really important feature - if you have enough of those then that gives you a really good chance of cracking a language that you don\\'t know.\\nHZ: What are the odds though?\\nNZ: Well, bilingual inscriptions are not uncommon in the ancient world, but you do still have to be have to be lucky to find them. It\\'s not rare for people to be for people to be bilingual in the ancient world. We tend to think of a situation where one nation state equals one language, which is really not true of the modern day any more than it was the ancient.\\nIF: And it\\'s very easy in England to think that, you know, you really need to know one language, and if you speak English and people don\\'t understand it, you just speak louder; you don\\'t need to bother with other languages. And so there\\'s a kind of common idea that knowing one language is natural. But in point of fact, it\\'s not natural.\\nJULIE TETEL ANDRESEN: Monolingualism is an aberration - most people have been multilingual.\\nHZ: This is the linguistic historiographer Julie Tetel Andresen. She has been studying how and why languages vanish.\\nJTA: The human body and brain is quite well adapted to multilingualism. So the ideology of monolingualism is a fairly new phenomenon, only the last couple of hundred years. It’s such a distortion.\\nIt is when the nation state came into being - late 18th century political theory. Think of the language situation before the mid-18th century. There were empires, multilingual conglomerations, whose borders waxed and waned with marriage and war; nobody cared about linguistic diversity, the great threat to unity was religious diversity. \\nWhen the state decided to mobilise language as a resource for creating the nation, you got the ideology of the monolingual nation state, where we want linguistic borders to coincide with national borders. \\nBut of course they never did.\\nHZ: And part of the fallout of this process is that, as one language dominates, the smaller, more regional languages die off.\\nJTA: People only give up their native language when it’s in their best interest - their economic or health interest.\\n It can be slowly, over time, but usually it’s a wholesale dropping of your native language and acquiring the language of power. So you lose your solidarity language; it has no more in-group effect for you, you can’t get a job, you can’t do anything. So you may maintain it yourself among your friends, but you don’t pass it down to your children. It can happen in a generation, two generations. \\nHZ: And this is probably how Oscan got wiped out.\\nNZ: In the course of the first millennium, the Romans stomped all over Italy and take it over. But when you get beaten up by the Romans, basically you have to sign a treaty with them which says you will send men to fight in their armies and that you won\\'t fight against them. The Romans don\\'t really care what language you\\'re speaking. But they do found Roman colonies over Italy, and the official language there is Latin and all the colonists are Romans so they\\'ll speak Latin. So basically it\\'s a bit like the reason English is so widespread today. There\\'s a lot of soft power. So if you want to get on in the world you have to be able to speak Latin; if you want to be a player in the Roman state, if you want to make money, if you want to have power, you have to speak Latin.\\nJTA: What gives language prestige? A long written tradition, often it has something to do with religion, the language of government, the language of politics - that gives language a prestige, and any language with those resources is going to have a better chance of survival. If it has prestige, that is almost the determiner of its fate. If it’s considered prestigious, people are going to learn it; if it’s not prestigious, people aren’t going to learn it. It seems like a distinctly non-linguistic feature; but language is a social product. Money talks; what language does it speak?\\nJulie Tetel Andresen\\n is a linguist and author. Her latest book, co-written with Philip Carter, is \\nLanguages In The World: How History, Culture and Politics Shape Language\\n. All proceeds will go to the Endangered Language Fund, which works to preserve languages around the world.\\nNick Zair’s book \\nOscan in the Greek Alphabe\\nt is out now, and you can find out more about the research project he is part of at \\ngreekinitaly.wordpress.com\\n.\\nAnd thanks very much to Irving Finkel, and Sian Toogood and Nick Harris of the British Museum for facilitating these episodes.\\nThis episode is sponsored by Poo-Pourri, the before-you-go toilet spray.

And although they are not etymologically related, there’s the same sense of separation in the roots of ‘excrement’ and ‘turd’.
