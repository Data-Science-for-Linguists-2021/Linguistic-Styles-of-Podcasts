       "  \"Sarah:   You're very white too. You're like a little Victorian ghost boy.  Mike:   Welcome to   You're Wrong About   the podcast that occasionally spins off into other podcasts.  Sarah:   \\xa0I think people have been describing this as an   Avengers   type situation, which I support because I want to be   Ant Man  .  Mike:   \\xa0If I had to pick an Avenger for you, it would absolutely be Ant Man.\\xa0  Sarah:   Okay. And so you have created a new podcast called   Maintenance Phase  . And which Avenger are you and what Avenger are you working with?\\xa0  Mike:   I think I would probably be Captain Marvel because she's kind of introverted and away from everything else. And then Aubrey, my co-host on Maintenance Phase, would absolutely be Captain America because she's very just pure and like the driven snow.  Sarah:   Yeah. I think those two are appropriate because of my extensive experience of the Avengers, which is seeing the first movie and the last movie and completely losing interest in the middle, those are the two characters who look at the world as it is and are like, I don't get it. But why, like, what's all this about? But, yeah, and I am excited for this podcast as a thing to exist in the world, but be, um, you know, not entirely disinterested in its success because I love you almost as much as I hate the President's Physical Fitness Test, which is the basis of your first episode.\\xa0  Mike:   This is the tone that we want to strike with every episode of just likable people talking about hateful things. This is most of what we're going to do.  Sarah:   People who love each other and hate the things they're talking about.  Mike:   So, yeah. What was your experience with the President’s Physical Fitness Test?  Sarah:   \\xa0Well, my event was the sit and reach, because I have very long arms. I have long legs, but I have longer arms and I have long ET fingers. And so I would just sit and reach, and I would actually push the little pusher thing. My fingers would go pass the farthest place you could push it because I was like 5’,10” in the sixth grade.\\xa0  Mike:   You were that kid? I remember that kid. They were like,”Wwe need a different box”.\\xa0  Sarah:   They didn't have a different box for me. They were like, yeah, yeah, here's your one thing you're good at once a year. We're not going to measure it properly. Yeah. Loved the sit and reach, and then everything else I was just like a bendy, floppy, hypermobile child. Like I still have only run a mile once in my life. Partly because I am so crushingly self-conscious about the way I was mocked by other children for the way I looked when I ran.\\xa0  Mike:   How do you look when you run that? I did not know this about you.  Sarah:   Imagine a marionette with too much string in the joints. That's what I look like when I do anything, which like adults don't point out whenever they see you. But I am convinced that that's what they'll do cause the last time I did fitness surrounded by a bunch of people I was 11. And so part of me believes that if I walk into a gym, I will be pointed at.  Mike:   It is amazing\\xa0 to me that sixth graders are not right about anything. And yet we all still have their judgements of us seared into our brains.  Sarah:   \\xa0I feel as if this is a situation where the fitness myths that they're being asked to shame each other into believing are propaganda created by adults, basically.  Mike:   \\xa0Yes. There's also the fascinating thing that being fat is seen as this like great moral transgression. And yet subjecting kids to this thing that objectively makes them miserable, despite no evidence and ample evidence that it doesn't work, the moral valence never seems to apply to any of the adults involved. Not to spoil the episode.\\xa0  Sarah:   Yeah. I think we know that the twist is not going to be that it's good actually. Yeah, no, that's good thought provoking to me because I feel like, yeah, it's like, why are gym teachers allowed to do all this stuff just because someone gave them a whistle?  Mike:   So you liked it, you enjoyed the episode?  Sarah:   \\xa0Oh my God. Yeah. It was very vindicating. And also like, I don't want to spoil it, but there's a point fairly early on where we learn that the Presidential Fitness Test is connected to our sundry, mid-sanctuary anxieties. I think that's like a vague enough way to put it. And I was like, I knew it. I find it very validating just to hone in on the particular health myths that were packed into our brains when we were very young and there's clearly a lot to cover. I'm excited for this.\\xa0  Mike:   So yes, we are putting this episode into your feeds and into your ears. And if you like it, you can subscribe to Maintenance Phase wherever your podcasts are. You can go find it on your telephone.\\xa0  Sarah:   Go buy a hot, fresh podcast from the podcast talker who comes down your street on Monday mornings.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. Enjoy. And we will see you soon with more Diana and more You're Wrong Abouts. Your wrongs About.  Sarah:   Yours Wrong About.  Mike:   Yes.  Sarah:   \\xa0Yeah. Nailed it.  Aubrey:   Hi everybody. And welcome to Maintenance Phase where we will tell you all about the hidden histories of health, wellness, and you know, your worst memories from childhood PE.  Mike:   That's remarkably accurate today, unfortunately.  Aubrey:   \\xa0I don't know anyone who felt affirmed by this particular thing. I'm Aubrey Gordon. I'm a writer, and author, and fat lady about town. And I can't shut up about my new dog.  Mike:   \\xa0Oh yeah. We have a special guest today sitting on your bed behind you.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Yeah, that's right. Fin Diesel. I'm here with the, with my cohost, Michael Hobbes.  Mike:   Petless Michael Hobbes, a reporter for HuffPost. And today we're talking about the president's physical fitness test, which is a site of intense trauma for, it appears like 97% of American children. I've seen very few people that are like, that was great, glad I did it.\\xa0  Aubrey:   I will say I have like a couple of good, like, I really liked being like a surprisingly flexible fat kid. There were a couple of things that I was really good at, but pull-ups are a nightmare that never ends.  Mike:   Unbelievable nightmare.  Aubrey:   \\xa0I have a vague recollection also of being like, you have to be on the bar for like 15 seconds or 30 seconds or something. Even if you don't do one.  Mike:   That's the flexed arm hang. That was the one that I always did because I couldn't do one pull-up. Where they would lift you above the bar. Your chin was above the bar and then you just had to hold yourself there for as long as possible.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Yeah, that's right.\\xa0  Mike:   And like you would start shaking. It was like, it was just awful.\\xa0  Aubrey:   I don't remember if the wall sit was part of that or if that was just a different thing that those PE teachers did.  Mike:   Well, as we will learn, the program wasn't very well organized. And it was kind of up to individual schools and individual teachers what they wanted to include on it. So fun fact, the rope climb was never on any official fitness test ever.\\xa0  Aubrey:   What?  Mike:   Yes. There was no instruction to make kids climb a rope. They just did that because they had one. So at your school, maybe they did the wall sit because your gym teacher wanted them.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Oh my God.\\xa0  Mike:   That was how scientific it was.  Aubrey:   Also what kind of jerk is like these kids gotta be able to climb to the top of that rope.  Mike:   These kids need someone to look at them from below. That's the thing that helps with all of their self-esteem no matter what. Do you want to summarize? Like what is the president's physical fitness test?\\xa0  Aubrey:   So the President's Physical Fitness Test. My recollection just as a consumer of it was that every classroom in the U.S. did this, and it was like a little battery of physical tests that always seemed sort of old fashioned to me. You know, you had to do a pull up and you had to do sit ups and you had to sit with your legs flat on the floor and sort of reach along a yardstick to see how many inches you could reach. We didn't have a ton of pull up bars. We had like one or two, so everybody's watching those one or two kids fail to do a pull up. And I also remember seeing kids who were like totally star athletes not be able to do some of this stuff.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. And remember how there was always like one random goth kid who was like in theater, who could just do like 55 pull-ups. I don't know what it was like, Trevor, really what? It did not correspond to kids' actual physical fitness in these like extremely obvious ways.  Aubrey:   Yes. There was a kid in our school who was super good at pull-ups and she was a Marilyn Manson superfan, and had little cat ears that she clipped into her hair every day. And she wrecked the President’s Physical Fitness Test.  Mike:   I also think a really big thing that people remember about the President's Physical Fitness Test is that it was quantitative. At the end you got an actual score. And of course, kids started competing for it. Right. Like, you can only do three pull-ups, but like I can do 12. And why can't you do as many? I mean, it was just so perfectly designed for kids to rank each other and to make fun of each other, because there was a literal number right there on the paper.\\xa0  Aubrey:   You sort of publicly see people feel betrayed by their own bodies, right? With a bunch of kids who, for the most part, didn't feel comfortable being vulnerable in front of each other.  Mike:   Yeah. It was also the most vulnerable kids feeling the worst. Right? In that it was the fat kids. It was like the kids who had asthma, who their teachers made them run the mile anyway. It was specifically structured to be the most humiliating for the least well-performing kids. Right. So all of that said the purpose of this episode is to try to tell the story of the President's Physical Fitness Test, how we got it, how the justifications for it changed over time. and what happened to it. But what's really surprising about this to me is that I have researched probably 50 episodes of   You're Wrong About   by this point, I have never researched a podcast that was so difficult to find basic information.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Really?  Mike:   \\xa0So the President's Physical Fitness Test at one point was used by 75% of schools. This was a massive nationwide program. And yet it's amazing. You look through the old historical accounts and there'll be like the 1950s, and then George W. Bush expanded the program. And you're like, wait, isn't there some information in between JFK and George W. Bush? I'm sorry.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Didn't you skip half of a century.  Mike:   So at one point I emailed one of the few researchers I found. It was a historian, literally a historian of fitness tests. I emailed him like, am I losing my mind? I cannot find any reports about this test or how it came about or what the debates were at the time. And he wrote back, and he basically said like, “Yeah, we don't do that in exercise studies”, because even in academia, everyone just accepted all of the precepts of fitness testing as gospel. Nobody really asked basic questions of like, is this helping? Should we be doing this? Are there other ways to achieve these goals?\\xa0  Aubrey:   This is so bizarre. And it feels like in some ways it feels like a little encapsulation of a challenge that we have with health and wellness in general. Right.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh yeah.  Aubrey:   \\xa0That there is this sort of very uncritical acceptance, and you have to be able to do these things. You have to look this way. You have to have these numbers in your chart and your blood work and all that kind of stuff. Like this just is what it is and you don't question it. Right. So I don't actually know where this, uh, where this all got started. It feels very sort of like mid-century, fifties, sixties kind of time.  Mike:   Oh my God. Yes.  Aubrey:   \\xa0So I'm curious, like where did this all start? And do you have any sense of what was the buildup to getting to this point to have like a national fitness test for kids?  Mike:   This is actually one of the few areas that we do know about. So the origins of this start with two doctors named Hans Kraus and Sonia Weber, who are, what was known at the time as ‘posture physicians’. This field eventually becomes basically physical therapy. There's, you know, if you have lower back pain, there's exercises that you can do and stretches that you can do. Or, you know, if your hips hurt.  Aubrey:   \\xa0You're strengthening some muscles so that others can rest a little more, basically.  Mike:   \\xa0Right. We had this sort of emerging physiology of like, why do so many Americans have back pain? This is something that had appeared after World War II. Basically it's like a lot of Americans were moving into sedentary jobs. And so the muscles that you're using to sort of move around and twist all these posture muscles were starting to atrophy. And so a huge number of Americans in their thirties and forties were showing up with back pain and shoulder pain and wrist pain. This was a new thing in the 1950s in America. And so these two doctors just started noticing that once they started doing these sort of sit up exercises and stretching the hamstrings and that kind of thing, oftentimes their pain would go away. And they became convinced that the real problem was that kids were not getting these skills in childhood. And so these two doctors come up with something called the Kraus Weber test, which is a six part test that is just measuring sort of your basic fitness, your basic like posture muscles. And so I'm about to tell you these six exercises, are you ready?  Aubrey:   \\xa0Yes, let's do it.\\xa0  Mike:   It's a very different test than the president's physical fitness test because it's not measuring a sort of peak of performance or average performance. It's just a binary test that measures minimum fitness. So each one of these exercises, you only have to do one.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Okay.  Mike:   Okay. So the first one is you're lying down on your back with your legs straight, your arms, straight at your sides, and you just sit up. That's it. You're not doing 50 sit ups. You're literally just like, you're lying down. And then you, you move into a seated position. And there's also the same one, but with your knees bent and your feet on the floor, and you just sit up into a seated position.  Aubrey:   \\xa0So that one's like a single sit-up, yeah.\\xa0  Mike:   So then you roll over, you're lying on your stomach, and then can you raise your head, chest, and shoulders off of the ground. Kind of like a reverse crunch. And then still lying on your stomach, can you raise your feet off of the ground, yes or no? And then there's one flexibility test, which is the one we've all done a million times. You're just standing there and then you reach down, and you touch your toes for three seconds.  Aubrey:   All right.\\xa0  \\xa0  Mike:   And so it's a very quick test. It's a very easy test and it gives you these really useful results because it's just like, yes, yes, no, no, no, yes. And you're like, okay, this is the level of fitness that you have. This is what we need to work on.\\xa0  Aubrey:   It's also really interesting because a lot of this has elements of sort of like yoga and pilates, both that is just sort of like, can your body move in these ways? Which is a very different approach than do a pull up in front of the classroom.\\xa0  Mike:   Like, and it's also because it's a minimum test. There's really not a lot of ways to stratify kids from this because there's no difference between somebody who can do one sit up and somebody who can do a hundred sit-ups it's just, can you do one, yes or no? It's not designed to shame children as, as later tests will be. It's more a diagnostic tool, basically.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Great. Go for it. Sounds good.\\xa0  Mike:   But so in the late 1940s and early 1950s Kraus Webber, and a woman named Bonnie Prudden, who becomes a really famous exercise guru, like early exercise guru. The three of them start administering this test to thousands of school kids. And eventually in the early fifties, they go to Europe and they test 3000 kids in Switzerland, Italy, and Austria on these tests. And so the scientific result that really begins the panic that leads us to the president's physical fitness test is after these tests, they find out that 58% of U.S. kids fail at least one of these tests and only 8% of the European kids fail these tests. So Americans are failing at these like basic minimum standards of fitness, far more than the European kids.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Well, and if we're talking forties and fifties, right, we're sort of like in the ramp up of the space race, it's post-World War II, there's this intense sense of like establishing the U.S. as a superpower and as like dominating on a bunch of fronts. So I could imagine that results like this would be like really alarming.  Mike:   \\xa0It's like an existential crisis when these results come out. Because one of the things that they find within these tests is that there's no difference between rich kids and poor kids or urban kids and rural kids. Something is wrong with America and Europe is beating us at this.  Aubrey:   Do they ever figure out what's at the root of that? Or are there sort of decent hypotheses about why that might be?\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. Yes. So the main hypothesis for this is American decadence. So this is an article from Hahn's Kraus interpreting the results. He says,   “Europeans rely less on automobiles, school buses and elevators. European children walk miles to school, ride bicycles, hike, chop, and haul wood for home heating. In contrast, American children are largely driven in cars by their parents, confined to their own neighborhoods, and obligated to perform only easy chores such as making their own beds and setting the table. Nothing more strenuous than walking the dog or mowing the lawn.”  Aubrey:   \\xa0That feels like such a little prototype of what's to come with sort of the obesity epidemic.  Mike:   Oh my God. I know.  Aubrey:   \\xa0There is a really fascinating book, I think it's called,   Diet and the Disease of Civilization  . The idea that this author is sort of positing is that the way that we think about diet and exercise and weight loss and all that sort of stuff is as we were in the Garden of Eden and we have fallen. And the reason we have fallen is because of civilization, is because of cars and buses and industrialization and all of that kind of stuff. And that the solution to that is to get quote unquote, get back to something that is like, preindustrial is almost the idea with a lot of fitness stuff. Where I'm like, cool. We could get back to pre-industrial times, but also you want to think about what life expectancy was in those days.\\xa0  Mike:   Right? Exactly. Yeah. They were just like eating raw meat off the ground. Like this is not necessarily a recipe for life.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Yeah, that seems right.  Mike:   So eventually we find out the actual reason that European kids did so much better on the test has much more to do with practice than American decadence. If the problem was American decadence, you know, we're not walking to school anymore. We're all living in the suburbs, whatever. That's actually a pretty small slice of Americans at this point. In 1950, we still had about half of American kids were walking or biking to school. It's actually very important that in these fitness tests, we don't have a stratification between rich kids and poor kids, urban kids and rural kids, because if this was about American decadence, well, they have rich kids in Europe and they have poor kids in America.\\xa0  Aubrey:   This also feels like just such a classic example of adult anxiety is getting projected onto kids. Right. That's like, okay, everything's gotten industrialized. Women are in the workplace to some degree or have been, right. We've got all these factories that were producing munitions that are now producing like dishwashers and shit like that. Like what's the human cost of not having to do this work. What's the human cost of living in cities and suburbs, right. Like I could imagine given the rate of change during that sort of post-war time that there would be a lot of anxiety to go around, and this seems like a weird place to put it.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh yeah. But then, what's really interesting about the Krauss Weber test is as Kraus and Weber themselves say, this is a test that can improve with practice. So American kids who take this test and fail it and then practice at it for six weeks, will then get the same results as Europeans. There's also the question of whether this is actually measuring fitness or is it just measuring, I mean, are you somebody who does sit ups on a regular basis? European kids, the PE that they get in school is much more like calisthenics, where it's one gym teacher standing at the front of the class and they'll do 50 jumping jacks together. And then they'll stand with their arms out and the kids have to kick up their left leg and kick up the right leg. And then they'll all do 50 sit-ups together. It's very regimented and sort of militaristic. Whereas what happened with this form of physical education, because this was actually very popular in America from around the 1890s until the 1950s, Americans did this too.\\xa0  But then what they found out was that this kind of exercise was really popular with the Nazis. This was a huge thing for Hitler, was this idea of sort of physical superiority, right? That it's not just enough to be white and blondes, you also have to be white and blonde and fit. And so the Nazis in Austria and Germany were doing a lot of these group exercise programs. So Americans got kind of uncomfortable with this stuff, and American schools in the 1940s started shifting over to sports. So instead of doing these calisthenics, we're going to play baseball. We're going to play football. The culture of sports shifted very quickly because we were all watching like the triumph of the will and it just got kind of creepy and weird.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Well, so the interesting thing here is that this also maps on to there's a flip side of this, right? There's not just establishing superiority through this, I would imagine there's also establishing inferiority, right? You're also sort of identifying who do we not want to have around it anymore?\\xa0  Mike:   Well also, so, I mean, as a guy who lived in Germany for five years and has read a lot about the Nazis over the years, it's also, I think really important to acknowledge that in authoritarian regimes, there will always be another spectrum of superiority. After you get rid of the Jews, then you're just going to start stratifying people by physical fitness. And then after you do that, you're just going to find some other reason to stratify people and get rid of the quote unquote, inferior people. This is a way of looking at the world. And so it's understandable that for American kids who have grown up playing baseball and doing these other things, they can't do sit-ups because they haven't been doing sit ups at school. And once you get them doing sit-ups at school everyday, they can do sit-ups. So there's nothing magical going on here. And the fact that, you know, kids that are playing soccer every day, you know, a couple of days a week with kids in their neighborhood, maybe they can't do a sit-up, but that doesn't mean that they're out of shape. It just means that they can't do this one specific thing.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Well, and based on a thing that was like, do you have back pain, adult? How do we treat your back pain, adult, right. Today like we got to get in there early so these kids don't have back pain 20 years later, I guess. Like, I just, like, there's some missing connections here, so.  Mike:   All of us, the reason why it's called the President's Physical Fitness Test is because Eisenhower sees these results, and he's a military guy and he immediately links the fitness of American kids to America is going to have problems fighting wars if this gets any worse.  Aubrey:   That's where the rope climbing comes in.  Mike:   Okay. Yeah. And also, I don't know if this is apocryphal, but Bonnie Prudden, this later exercise guru, she gets invited to the white house and she gives Dwight Eisenhower the Kraus Weber test, and he passes and then she tells him, you know, 60% of American kids don't pass these tests  Aubrey:   And he’s like: *gasp*.  \\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. And so in July of 1956, Eisenhower creates the president's council on youth fitness. And one of the reasons that he wants to do this is because he wants it to be separate from all of these other government agencies. He doesn't want it to get bogged down in all of this bureaucracy. And so this is from a Sports Illustrated article in 1955. So this is the quote from his name's Frank Carston. He's a Missouri Democrat. He says, “According to Dr. Kraus, the physical fitness of American children is eight times lower than that of the physical fitness of European children. Simply on the mathematical surface this is a ridiculous statement, and I am very much surprised that you would dignify it”, which like, yes, like people should have been more skeptical of this than they were.  Aubrey:   Totally.  Mike:   He also says, “I asked the president to explore the matter through the proper governmental agencies rather than simply taking stock in Dr. Kraus’ figures”. So he's essentially saying, why are we doing this? As a completely separate thing, if this is so important, it's very strange that you're setting up this separate president's council with an executive order.  Aubrey:   Right? Why wouldn't you use like health departments? Why wouldn't you use like education departments, why wouldn't you use, like, there are vehicles that are better positioned and have more infrastructure to do this kind of thing.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. And there's also policies that you could pass. One of the things that I think is actually really important and this really sets the template for the issue of youth fitness for the next 50 years, is that it is always conceived throughout every future president that touches this issue. It is always conceived as a) so important that we have to do something about it. We have to rally parents. We have to rally schools b) it's not important enough to change any actual laws or make any sacrifices. This is what Eisenhower says,   “I believe you and I share the feeling that more and better coordinated attention should be given to this most precious asset of our youth. By this, I do not mean that we should have an overriding federal program. The fitness of our young people is essentially a home and local community problem. Your deliberations also reveal a need for a rousing in the American people, a new awareness. Of the importance of physical and recreational activity.”   This is the Republican approach to so many things where it's like, it's really, really, really important, but not important to actually do anything about it. We're going to leave it to local communities. We're going to leave it to parents. And you know, my, my rule of thumb on this is whenever somebody says, we need a culture of X in America, we need a culture of exercise in America. That means they don't want to do anything about it. That means they want things to change spontaneously.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Wait, can I tell you something? Ooh, I just turned in a new piece and the title is it's time to bring a culture of consent to diet talk. I’m the problem, Michael!  Mike:   You’re the enemy!\\xa0  Aubrey:   \\xa0No, but totally like I hear you right. That if you're talking about a culture of something, then there's not necessarily like a single person who's responsible.  Mike:   Yes. Yeah. One of the things that's amazing, I actually found a really fascinating article about the systemic visitation of children's play. What they find is that in the early years of this council, so right after Eisenhower sets it up, it's actually really cute and really lovely. So the first wave of this organization, what they start putting out is all these recommendations that are really about, we need to give children open-ended forms of play. And it's really important for kids to have hobbies, but it's not important what those hobbies are. So one of their, one of their first recommendations that they put out in one of these reports that comes out in 1956, it says schools should have more time equipment and personnel for physical education and should focus increased attention on children who are not athletically gifted rather than on stars. So it's already saying like, let's, let's look at the kids that need a little bit more help and let's focus on them because like the buff football jock, who's doing 24 pull-ups he really doesn't need us. It also mentioned specifically, and this is dope for 1956. It says, make sure that girls have equal opportunities for physical fitness.  Aubrey:   Whoa, Hey! That's great.\\xa0  Mike:   This is from the, um, terrific article on this that I found, it says in the conference's final report to the president, the conferees offered a definition of fitness that encompasses the total person, spiritual, mental, emotional, social, cultural, as well as physical.\\xa0  Aubrey:   That is like some whole child learning that is, even today can be kind of a radical approach. That's kind of bad-ass ahead of its time thinking.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. And in their reports, they even mentioned stuff like camping and fishing and bowling, these things that are not necessarily the most athletic, right. You're not dripping sweat when you're fishing, but it's also, it's just a nice recreational activity and some kids are going to be more suited to that then they are to jogging 10 miles and that's fine.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Totally.\\xa0  Mike:   And this is the last time that this is going to happen in this episode, but they actually propose changes to the physical environment. That one of the things they say is that cities should start closing down streets to cars so that they create time and space for children without excessive adult oversight. They're essentially saying, let kids play in the street, let them meet their neighbors. Let them play frisbee, let them ride their bikes. It doesn't really matter what it is.\\xa0  Aubrey:   I will say this is something that is, that we are sort of working toward in Portland, Oregon now, not for kids playing purposes, but for like maybe some streets should just be for bikes and pedestrians. And the freak out around that from folks who drive cars is like astronomical. So it's really fascinating to hear this, you know, coming around, you know, 60 years ago, plus 70 years ago now.\\xa0  Mike:   I mean, it is this glimpse of the health and wellness rhetoric that we could have had if we hadn't diverted into this fork of weight. You know, some kids are going to like fishing and they're not going to be able to do a pull-up and fine. Like, I don't need every kid to be getting their resting heart rate above 90 beats per minute, three times a day like this, this quantification is something that has become so poisonous around all of our rhetoric or on food and health and fitness. And this was a time when basically this council explicitly resisted calls to do that. Right. They resisted the idea of testing kids. They resisted the idea of setting a baseline for fitness. They basically said, let's not tell them what kind of play we want them to do, or what play is or what it means to be fit. There's no point in doing that. Let's just give them the space.  Mike:   Yeah. Play with your army guys. Go hang out in the forest. You know what I mean? Like build weird structures that do whatever you want, like right. Like weird kid play. So I'm super curious about how we got from this point of this council resisting this kind of measurement. And then in pretty short order, it sounds like we pivot into now there's a national test.\\xa0  Mike:   So what happens is, and the way that we get to the president's physical fitness test that we know today is the sort of academic expert community starts to coalesce around a new way of thinking about fitness that becomes really popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There's a guy called Charles McCloy who becomes really famous by writing a bunch of magazine articles. One of his most famous articles is called,   How About Some Muscle?   She essentially makes the same argument that Krauss was making in 1953, kids are too soft. And the problem is we don't have any measurable goals for these kids and what the hell are these president's council, whatever, whatever people are doing that, you know, they'd been doing this for a couple years and we don't even have baselines of what kids should be able well to do. And so in 1958, the president's council gives in to this changing paradigm of fitness and this increasing quantification of fitness and produces the first official U.S. government fitness tests. I'm going to read you the activities that are on it.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Okay. Yes, please.  Mike:   So it has eight fitness tests. So first straight legs sit ups, standing broad jump.  They're measuring how far you can jump pull-ups for boys or modified pull-ups for girls. That's the flex arm hang. The 50 yard dash. The shuttle run. That's the thing where you pick up an eraser and then you run back and then you pick up another eraser and you basically run back and forth for a couple of minutes. There's the 600 yard run. There's a softball throw where they measure how far you can throw a softball. And then there are three aquatic tests.\\xa0  Aubrey:   What are the aquatic tests?  Mike:   \\xa0I could not, I could not find this out. The test says that they're optional. I've seen no literature on schools actually implementing these because like you'd have to go to a different building.  Aubrey:   Your school would have to have a pool.\\xa0  Mike:   Exactly. Like what's step one. Also imagine how much worse the president's physical fitness test would have been if you had to do part of it in a fucking bathing suit. I am very glad that these have been lost to time.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Totally. Although I will say I was like a swim team, fat kid. That was my, that was my activity of choice. I loved it and was like super good at it.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. But also if we had done that, I would have had to test my percentile rank at hiding a boner, that would have been like every other boy is going to just be like wandering around the Speedo and like doing sit-ups. I'm like, ah, I don't think we're measuring what we want to be measuring here guys. So what's interesting about these tests is that nobody knows how they were put together. We don't have clear literature on sort of who proposed them specifically, but the theory that academics have come up with over the years is that all of them are linked to military prowess. So things like the long jump, the shuttle run, all of that is, you know, running through the jungles when you're invading another country. Like these are skills that you need for doing military maneuvers. Also I signed one article, they said that the soft ball throw, how far can you throw a softball? That's linked to potentially throwing grenades.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Jesus.\\xa0  Mike:   You don't want to get too conspiratorial about these things, but it's clear that there was a military reason, a national security reason for doing these things. So that's the sort of half tin foil hat explanation of how these exercises got in there.  Aubrey:   Do you know? I don't, I don't know why this is what just popped into my head, but this is such a bizarre thing that's like, we don't think of our children as soldiers, right? Like we're against child soldiers, but we are for child military readiness. Like if push came to shove, we do know how far that kid can throw a grenade or-  Mike:   We want to know what is his willingness to kill? So it's the late fifties, this test has been developed, but it's not really being used in that many schools. Like there's still not a national PE program. So this obscure government body has created this test, but it's not in all of the schools yet. But then what happens is JFK comes into office.  And apparently this is one of the first times this has ever been done, that right after he was elected. But before he took office, he wrote an editorial in Sports Illustrated called the Soft American, which basically lays out exactly the same argument as Krauss and Weber had made in 1953, the American kids are soft. Their fitness is bad. The fitness of kids is actually worse in 1961 than it is in 1953. So he starts out his essay by saying, “The first indication of a decline in the physical strength and ability of young Americans became apparent among U.S. soldiers in the early stages of the Korean war. Almost one out of every two young Americans was being rejected by selective service as mentally, morally, or physically unfit.”  Aubrey:   Sorry, was it physically, mentally, or morally unfit? He's going to throw in the mentally and morally and not really unpack that at all my dude?  Mike:   I know it's like how much time do we have on this show?\\xa0  Aubrey:   Buddy that's all that was a big bucket to throw a lot of people into and then be like, they all just need some exercise.  Mike:   It's like really not the point there's also, but then he does the thing he ends his sports illustrated article doing the exact same thing that Eisenhower did and that every future president will do. He says, you know, this is so important. Our bodies are getting soft. We need to beat the Soviets. We need to be a vital nation, vigorous, blah, blah, blah. And then he's like, okay, here are my recommendations. Here's what we need to do to solve this problem. I'm going to read these to you,   “First establish a White House committee on health and fitness. Make the physical fitness of our youth, the direct responsibility of the department of health, education, and welfare. The governor of each state must be invited to attend the annual national youth fitness Congress.”   So it's like establish a fucking committee, invite governors to a meeting? It's so important and this is the only way we're going to beat the Soviets, but you just want to hold a bunch of meetings and bring the president's council into a different government department. And so another really important thing that he does is he establishes an award. So you probably remember this from when you were a kid that the kids who scored above the 85th percentile on all six categories of the president's physical fitness test got an achievement, or I don't know if it was like a ribbon or like a metal or whatever it was, but they would get sort of officially recognized for being one of the fittest kids at school. This was seen as a way of promoting physical education and kind of fostering friendly competition amongst kids.  Aubrey:   \\xa0How friendly was it?\\xa0  Mike:   I know, you could tell from the competition in quotes, like that's such an oxymoronic phrase to me “friendly competition” in schools.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Also like the people who call school sports friendly competition are the people who win every quote unquote friendly competition. It's just like only the people who feel great about it, who are like, it's fine.\\xa0  Mike:   But so what's amazing about this entire field is that we keep having the same moral panic about the fitness of children. Right. So we had, in the fifties, we had it again in the sixties and in the 1980s, we start getting another wave of news articles coming out, saying kids are less fit than they used to be. Kids are watching more TV. It's now getting more wrapped up in the obesity epidemic. And in TV watching, which is a decades long moral panic about children. But basically, we just get a third wave of articles coming out, being like, look how unfit our kids are.\\xa0  Aubrey:   I feel like I'm going to end up, like in the style of Jerry Seinfeld having a clenched fist and rather than saying Newman, I'm going to end up saying Reagan. School fitness can't trickle down, but money has to.  Mike:   And so in the midst of all of these swirling anxieties, states start passing laws that every kid needs to get a fitness test once per year. So this is when we get the huge explosion of the president's physical fitness test being launched into schools. We also get, in 1986, a new version of the test. This is the version that you and me remember is the 1986 version. It consists of the one mile run slash walk, curl ups, basically sit ups, pull ups, the shuttle run. The V sit reach, which is this thing where you're sitting down with your legs spread and you see how far you can reach your hands forward. And then the sit and reach, which is the same thing, but your feet are together.  Aubrey:   I remember the sit and reach well, we had like a weird little like box that you put your feet into.\\xa0  Mike:   Remember the box.\\xa0  Aubrey:   And then there was like a yard stick, like glued to it or something. It was like a weirdly janky kind of thing.  Mike:   Super janky. And a lot of kids that actually were flexible and like did dance and stuff couldn't do that very well because it was a very specific form of flexibility.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Totally. I completely forgot that the mile is part of it. I think I have blocked out the mile because it was so horrible.\\xa0  Mike:   One year at my school boycotted it. And I walked as slowly as I could. And I sat down and I read a Stephen King book for like 10 minutes in the middle of it. And I remember they had to delay the start of the next class just for me, because I refused to do it. I took 27 minutes to do the mile.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Oh my God. That's like the courage I wish I had. So we had at my school, it was a long path to get from the gym to the track. You had to like walk through this sort of like, this is very Pacific Northwest, you have to walk through this big, long, like sort of forest section. To get down to the track. So everyone had to go down to the track together. And when we would run the mile, you would just watch the fastest kids finish first without even really breaking a sweat. And it was reliably, there were two kids who were last, and it was me and this other fat kid who was a friend of mine. And there were two outcomes and both of them were mortifying to me. One was that many of the kids who finished first would get resentful, that they were like, had this potential free time and they couldn't walk back up to the gym and change and get that free time back.  Mike:   Because they had to sit there and watch the fat kids, which just like, is structured to encourage bullying.  Aubrey:   And the flip side of that was there were some kids who finished faster, who I think thought of themselves as nice kids. And we're absolutely trying to do a nice thing. And they would like sort of jog alongside us and be like, good job. You can do it. This is more spotlight that I do not want right now.  Mike:   It's so mortifying. I fucking remember that.  Aubrey:   It’s just such a creepy way to like, decide to be inspired by like to center your own reaction to what someone else is doing right. Rather than what they probably want and need.\\xa0  Mike:   It was just so, it was just so mortifying the entire exercise. So this is also the time in the late eighties and the early nineties when schools start doing what they call body composition tests.\\xa0  Aubrey:   No.\\xa0  Mike:   As part of the president's physical fitness test, they started measuring kids' BMI's and they started doing skin fold tests. So there's something called the fitness gram, where they take a measurement of your skin fold on the back of your right arm and on your right calf. And they measure how thick the skin is. And that's a measurement of your body fat percentage, basically.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Totally bananas.  Mike:   Totally bananas. There's also some schools that are weighing all the kids, but they only have one scale. So they have to do it in front of everybody else. And they read out the number, which is just, again, designed to shame the fattest kids.  Aubrey:   Well, and it's also like, as I'm sure it's as close as you get to a guarantee of somebody in that class getting an eating disorder.  Mike:   This is what happens when obesity becomes the frame through which we look at all health issues. It's not really about testing fitness anymore. It's about testing fatness.  Aubrey:   I'm super curious about the degree to which there is even just a shared definition at this point of like what physical fitness consists of.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh my fucking God.  Aubrey:   \\xa0This feels like a way of defining it through negative space. Right. It's not being fat yet, which I'm like, okay, but then what isn't though.\\xa0  Mike:   This actually gets into the next section that we're going to dwell on for a while, which is the problems with the president's physical fitness test. So even on this, there's not as much academic literature as I would like, but there's actually much more on the challenges of the test and the deficiencies of the test than there is on its actual history. So as the test becomes much more popular, much more widespread, kids are being now required by law to get it every single year, studies started coming out about the fact that it's really not achieving any of its goals. And one of the reasons is that kids are not practicing the president's physical fitness test. I mean, this is something that really like made an audible click in my head when I was reading it that in middle school, we would just have gym class. And, you know, we'd play volleyball and whatever. And then one day a year we would do this dumb physical fitness test. And then we would just go back to what we were doing.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Right. You weren't doing a sit and reach every month.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah. So it was basically okay, a random Wednesday. We're just going to come in, you're going to do this thing. You're going to feel like shit. And then we're never going to talk about it.\\xa0  Aubrey:   And then we're going to go back to playing Dodge ball and we won't test you on your dodge ball acuity or whatever, right? Yeah.  Mike:   So it’s totally separated from any actual program. I mean, I could actually see some use in some of these things like, hey, we're going to help kids get flexible. So at the beginning of the year, we're going to do the toe touch. We’re going to do a bunch of other stretching exercises. Every single day for three months we're all going to do stretches together as a class. And at the end, we're going to test ourselves again and look how much you improved. I can see that being a pretty positive experience for kids. Like, look, you can train your body and you can become better at something. And maybe you'll find a love for like downward dogging or something. And maybe you'll continue doing that at home. Great. But it was never done like that. It was just like, you piece of shit. You can't even do one pull-up. Okay. See you next year where you're also not going to be able to do one pull-up.  Aubrey:   So like basically the lesson that we learned that sparked this whole thing, right, that European kids were getting practice in these specific things. We then did not apply for all of this time. Right. We shouldn't be allowed to be surprised by, you didn't practice a thing and then you didn't get better. That shouldn't be, that's just like people. That's just how people work.  Mike:   Totally. And another, I mean, another problem with this, and I think this is really key to almost all of these sorts of national, overall projects that we have about PE in schools is that schools, teachers were never really given very much instruction or extra resources for this. Again, it's not like this was like a six week fun program that all the kids are going to do together. And we're all going to become stronger in these specific ways. It was like, hey, PE teachers, you're required by law to give this test once a year. But we’re not really going to give you guidelines on how to do it.  How to communicate the results to kids or what the results mean. Teachers, since the 1950s, have absolutely hated this test and teachers and principals have been opposed to it from day one, but no one ever really listened to those concerns or took them seriously because like, oh, it's just teachers who cares? Only the people on whom we depend for the success of the programs. So why would we listen to them obviously? Right?\\xa0  Aubrey:   Right. I mean, this is sort of like a shitty, like obstructionist term that gets thrown around a lot, but like, it is a pretty classic unfunded mandate. Yeah. Just go do a bunch of other stuff and we're not going to pay you for it. We're not going to figure it out for you. You'll figure it out for yourselves and whatever, but you should definitely be very concerned about it. Like what.  Mike:   \\xa0I mean, this, this is one of my biggest shocks when I was researching this. And because I'm a methodology queen, I get really angry at stuff like this. First of all, the data that we get from the fitness tests is pretty shitty because the data is being gathered in such a poor way. Like they say, in the BMI test that a lot of kids are getting weighed, like with their jackets on or with their shoes.  Aubrey:   That’s like fat lady 101. You go into Weight Watchers, you take off as many clothes as possible. Come on. It's like these kids don't even know how to diet!  Mike:   \\xa0But like this is to me is completely ridiculous that no one ever did anything with the results, the primary thing that was done with the actual numbers that were produced by millions of kids taking this test every year was they would just identify kids to get awards. So all that stuff about like percentile rankings, all of that is based on other academic studies that were done, the actual numbers that were produced by all of the surveillance of all these kids, no public health departments were plugged into that, that wasn't going to principals to like track kids over time. All of these numbers that we produced, they didn't do anything. They were just there to make us feel shitty. And then they just went into the recycling.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Yeah. So they weren't even like aggregated? There wasn't even like a report?  Mike:   No!  Aubrey:   Ugh! Reagan!  Mike:   And another thing that comes up in the studies on this is that none of the actual fitness tests measured fitness. So I found a really good meta-analysis of all of the individual tasks that were the components of the president's physical fitness tests. And there's literally no evidence that the ability to do pull-ups is related to overall upper body strength.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Right? If it did, no one would have any, we would all have T-Rex arms. Like of course it's not indicative of shit.\\xa0  Mike:   This actually comes up in this review that it's extremely strange to pick a measure of fitness that most children cannot do. You can have a lot of different kids that cannot do a pull-up and some of those kids are extremely fit and some of those kids are extremely unfit, but because all of them are putting up the numbers zero, you're not catching any of those gradations. And so what this review finds is that pull-ups are a much better measure of body fat percentage than anything else because your body weight is inversely correlated to how many pull-ups you can do. So you're basically just measuring how fat the kids are. It's not actually useful as anything else.\\xa0  Aubrey:   This is always sort of a fascinating thing when people talk about fitness where they're like, I don't know that fat guy gets winded real fast and I'm like, yeah, he's carrying 200 more pounds than you are.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. And working harder. Yes.\\xa0  Aubrey:   And he's working harder every day to do everything right. I don't understand how this doesn't translate for folks, but okay.  Mike:   Basically, if we were designing a fitness test from scratch, now we would not be using any of these things because they don't actually test fitness. The studies actually mention that there's no good test for fitness of kids, generally, because when we talk about, you know, how fit should kids be? It's really difficult because what we're basically trying to do is predict things far in the future, right? Which kids are going to get heart disease, which kids are going to get lower back pain, et cetera. And so it's really difficult to tell what should kids be able to do at 12? That's going to predict what happens to them when they're 50.\\xa0  Aubrey:   It is presenting itself as public health work. And what it is doing for sure is just ramping up weight stigma.  Mike:   Oh yeah. I mean, this is one of the central criticisms of the fitness test that starts showing up in the literature around 2000, especially after the implementation of no child left behind. When a lot of schools start cutting PE programs and some schools even start cutting recess because everything becomes built around standardized test scores. And so a lot of schools cut their PE programs because they have to focus on STEM or whatever, but they still have this legal requirement to do the fitness test. So a lot of schools that don't even have PE will sort of one day a year, pull all the kids aside and make them do these humiliating fitness tests and weigh them and then just send them back into school. So it's not even like this is being contextualized in a PE class. It's literally just, you're sitting all the time and then we test you and we're like, why are you so unhealthy? And then you just go back to sitting the next day.  Aubrey:   \\xa0Yeah. Right. It also feels like we don't have a test once a year to see how well you can draw a still life and then defund art education. Right. Like it's like, hey man, there's a pretty clear connection here from one to the other. And the episode with this really fascinating article by Michael Gard, who's the academic who I emailed about the lack of history on the President's Physical Fitness Test. So he wrote a fascinating article called,   Why is There So Little Critical Physical Education Scholarship in the United States?   And it's basically about this problem, that the same articles with the same panic statistics keep getting published. And yet nobody seems to come to the obvious conclusion that fitness testing is not working. That there's an entire body of researchers that are looking at the data that is being produced by this and the experiences that kids are having and have been having as a result of these tests for almost 40 years now. And they're just like, well, it has to still be good. So what he says is, “  The remarkable point here is that despite these findings widespread inaccuracies, negative student and teacher perceptions, and potentially harmful practices, the authors remain apparently unshakeable in their support for fitness testing. An interesting feature of papers such as this is the way the distaste or disinterest of people toward fitness testing is almost uniformly interpreted as a matter of communication rather than substance. Indeed, despite the widely reported resistance of parents, children, and teachers in the fitness testing literature, fitness testing is presented as a settled and unassailable practice that is inherently beneficial for individuals, families, and society.”\\xa0  This shit is fire emojis. He's really mad about this. And I found a bunch of articles in the literature that illustrate exactly the point that he is making. It's amazing. There's all of these papers about sort of the ongoing debate about fitness testing. And should we keep fitness testing and it's a controversial subject and what are the pros and cons? And what is amazing about them is that when they present the pros and cons of fitness testing, all of the pros are potential things of fitness testing and all of the cons are actual drawbacks.  Aubrey:   \\xa0So the pros are sort of like imagined.  Mike:   Yeah, let me walk you through one of these. So one of the main sorts of literature reviews of the debate surrounding fitness testing, the data surrounding fitness testing, it lists at the end of the article, the pros and the cons. What are the good, what are the bad? What do various people say? They've read all of the literature. The first benefit that he lists is tracking the fitness of youth,   “Information concerning the distribution of scores can be used to track youth fitness over time.”   Well, they're not doing that right.\\xa0  Aubrey:   In order to do that, you would have to aggregate your data somewhere.  Mike:   In order to do that, you would have to do that. This paper also does something that I think is very typical, where people substitute the benefits of fitness testing for the benefits of fitness. So they say like, well, you know, fitness is really good for kids. And it's like, yeah, fitness is really good for kids, but that doesn't mean fitness testing is good for kids, right? That's not an argument to tell kids to do pull-ups and then make them feel shitty for not being able to do a pull-up once a year. That's very distinct from like, let's all play volleyball on Wednesdays.  Aubrey:   If you want to foment a sort of commitment to fitness, a) you need a class and b) you need a class where instructors are aware of, you know, what makes kids take things in and what makes kids change their behaviors and that kind of thing. You're not going to do it by hiring a bunch of football coaches and then being like anyway, now care about fat kids.  Mike:   Another one of the main arguments for fitness testing is that we need to raise awareness of the obesity epidemic. Like this is something you see in so many articles, it's like, oh, we need to make kids aware that the obesity epidemic is a problem. And that physical fitness is good. And it's like, again, testing them and making them feel shitty is not a good approach to this.  Aubrey:   Right. I mean, it's the same reason that like, ideally if you have a math test and you have kids who have a hard time with math, you don't call them up to the front of the class and be like, Hey, look at these dummies. That's not a way that people learn, nor is it a way that people get invested.  Mike:   \\xa0Yes. It's like, I think all kids should learn to read, but instead of actually giving them time to read and dedicating teachers to teaching them how to read, I'm just going to test them once a year and be like, why the fuck can't you read? That's my way of raising awareness of the importance of reading. And then this is from this literature review. It says when tests are properly administered, fitness testing provides useful information for students to determine their needs, setting goals and plan programs for improvement. Well, again, they're not doing that. So yes, if they were properly administered, sure they have the potential to do that, but that's been true since the 1950s and that potential has never been reached. So I don't see why that's really relevant. Like yeah, a lot of things have potential to be good.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Yes, totally. There's a ton of potential. The question is, does a test fulfill that potential? Right? And it seems like we don't really know that.\\xa0  Mike:   I mean, maybe there's a school district in America that has done fitness testing as part of an integrated program in a way that doesn't make kids feel shitty about themselves. But as far as a nationwide program and legal requirements, it's clear that this is not working. So after listing all of these potential benefits of fitness tests, things that could come to pass, but have not, they start listing the drawbacks. First one is teacher motivation and support. Teachers are not being motivated. Teachers are not supported. Teachers fucking hate this. That's a real, like, that's not a potential, that's a real thing. Teachers have disliked this test for 70 years. Right?\\xa0  Aubrey:   Right. But in order to take that into account, we would have to listen to what teachers have to say about education. Michael, why would we do that? Why would we start that now?\\xa0  Mike:   We'd have to ask teachers what they need. This one is amazing. The second bullet point on the cons of fitness testing is student motivation and self-esteem. Of concern or the percentage of elementary school teachers reporting that students cried during testing and the reports of high school students who had negative test experiences. So, uh, kids are fucking crying and you're like, ooh, the potential of the test is still there.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Right? It's like, um, you know, what I love doing is things that make me cry in front of my peers.  Mike:   Fucking crying taking this test, teachers fucking hate it. And we're like, well, you know, it could work, but you know, we're taking no steps to make sure that it works right.\\xa0  Aubrey:   And also, how else are we going to know how far a child can throw a grenade? There is essential information embedded in your mind.  Mike:   Right? So this is from yet another literature review of this debate over fitness testing that says in the fucking abstract, “There is currently no consensus on the importance, need, or impact of fitness tests on student experiences in physical education. Several studies highlight the negative impact fitness testing has on students' experiences in physical education, such as the formation of negative attitudes toward PE, decreased motivation toward PE following poor test scores, and feelings of humiliation when failing in front of peers. These findings provide compelling evidence that fitness test experiences do little to promote positive feelings about lifelong physical activity and fitness.” So even on its own terms, even if you're using fitness testing as a way of quote unquote, raising awareness about the need for kids to move and the badness of the obesity epidemic, et cetera, even on those terms, it's not fulfilling its mission, because people are doing this and they're feeling discouraged from doing physical activity because their experience was so bad.  Aubrey:   I would say for me personally, not only did these fitness tests not incentivize physical fitness, they attach trauma to it. So like deeply increased my, like, I was like a pretty active kid until this kind of shit kicked in where it was, became the sort of social rankings stuff. So like now when I am active, which I like I'm relatively active, right. I have to do it in ways that don't remind me of gym class, right? There's a reason I've never done another fucking pull up in my life. There's a reason I don't like stand around my house doing wall sits. Right. The reason that all of these things are like, I don't engage with them remotely anymore.  Mike:   And also, I mean, Michael Gard, this researcher, one of the only skeptical researchers on this entire field. He has an entire book about how we have tried for decades to use schools as public health promotion devices. D.A.R.E is a good example. We've done alcohol education in schools. We've done physical education. We, we keep trying to use schools as a way to solve public health problems. And the fact is you can't solve public health problems without public health approaches. That if we actually want kids to get moving, we need to just make it easier for them to do that, right. Again, we need to close streets and give them a place to play. We need to make it safe for them to walk and bike to school. We need to build\\xa0 playgrounds and parks near them so they can use them. We need to give parents decent working schedules so they can go on walks with their kids and throw frisbees around. It's these things that will actually encourage the outcomes that we want rather than just fucking raising awareness of like exercise is good and fatness is bad, right?  Aubrey:   We also don't need to tell people that smoking is bad at this point. If you are smoking at this point, it is for other reasons than not knowing, like you don't need to worry that fat people don't know that it's like bad to be fat or that it's seen as bad to be fat. Like you don't need to worry about that. That box is checked, team.  Mike:   \\xa0So the closest thing to a happy ending that we're going to get is it appears a lot of states are actually starting to finally get rid of these absurd laws requiring fitness tests. So California is at the Vanguard of this. There's a big debate in California right now about whether to get rid of this requirement. And interestingly it is being led by the parents of nonbinary kids.\\xa0  Aubrey:   Oh sure.\\xa0  Mike:   Because these male/female totally different, you know, binary requirements, the trans kids, nonbinary, intersex kids, and their parents are like, “Well, this is really alienating to me and fuck you.” So I hope that like this results in a broader movement to just get ready of these tests altogether.  Aubrey:   Seriously.\\xa0  Mike:   So yeah, that's the end of my, um, long torturous depressing journey through the president's physical test. It's worse than you thought.  Aubrey:   \\xa0It's so much worse than I thought. but I also have to say, I feel oddly at peace and validated that it wasn't just a shit show for me and for the fat kids that I knew and the disabled kids that I know. But that it is just a garbage fire of public policy.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes.  Aubrey:   \\xa0From like every angle it's like pretty indefensible at this point.\\xa0  Mike:   Yes. There was no evidence to do it in the first place. The evidence that it works is non-existent and the evidence that getting rid of it is good is there, so just on every level, like, yes, let's do this.  Aubrey:   Listen aside from fat kids disabled, it's like, aside from everyone, who's on the downside of this really terrible activity, what’s the problem? Jocks really seem to like their trophies.  Mike:   That one girl who looked like Marilyn Manson, she loves it. We’re doing it for her.\\xa0\"],\n",

Sarah  : I have actually changed topics on you, but that one that tagline is still relevant to the topic I've landed on. Don't worry.  Mike  : Wait, what?\\xa0  Sarah  : You have seen into the future.  Mike  : Wait, we're not doing the psychics episode?  Sarah  : Well, we will soon, but yeah, not at this second. We're doing something perhaps even better.  Mike  :\\xa0 I am Michael Hobbes. I'm a reporter for the   Huffington Post  , who has no idea what's going on.\\xa0  Sarah  : I'm Sarah Marshall. I'm working on a book about the satanic panic. I kind of know what's going on, sometimes.  Mike  : And if you'd like to support the show, we're on Patreon at   patreon.com/yourewrongabout  , and you can find us in other places. And I'm rushing through this because I want to know what we're talking about today.  Sarah  : Yay! Okay, so here's what happened with today's topic. I told you we were doing police psychics.  Mike  : Yes.  Sarah:   And I was researching that and then I was like, you know, if I'm doing this, it really makes sense to get, start from the beginning and tell the story of the police.  Mike  : Well, it is time that we talked about staying on this podcast.  Sarah  : And I thought, well, that will be a really fun and harrowing journey. But before we do that, I would like us to do something on the cozier side.\\xa0  Mike  : Ok.  Sarah  : Because it's November and very little in this world is making me happy right now. But you know what does make me happy?  Mike  : Plants?  Sarah  : That's true but also   Newsies  .\\xa0  Mike:   Ooh.  Sarah  : I want to start with some   Newsies   background and then we're going to do the   Newsboy’s Strike  . \\xa0  Mike  : Okay, now my tagline is way off.  Sarah  : No, I think your tagline is great and you will see how apropos it is, hopefully by the end of this episode. And then we'll discuss this apropos further in our second episode.  Mike  : Fabulous.\\xa0  Sarah:   Mike, what is the movie   Newsies  ?  Mike  : I know nothing, I haven't seen it. All I know is what you have told me on various bonus episodes, which is that I guess it's about little boys who sell newspapers and they sing and they go on strike at some point.\\xa0  Sarah:   That's very true, except for the script for little boys. Because while there are some little children in this movie, quite a lot of it is about strapping teen boys, including future Batman, Christian Bale.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh, I thought they were like five, okay.\\xa0  Sarah  : When I was a 15-year-old girl, I found this news very intriguing, when I first sat up and watched   Newsies  .\\xa0 And my fascination with   Newsies   in a nutshell is that Disney somehow produced a very pro-union, pro-labor rights, pro-beating up scabs movie in 1992. Disney.\\xa0 And it's also this unique example in nineties media of something that had something positive to say about unions and about labor rights. I mean, I think I'm speaking about my household, but I'm also speaking about sort of the American white middle class and the propaganda. There was this idea that like unions had gone too far.  Mike:   Yup.  Sarah  : And they were just corrupt and like Jimmy Hoffa, et cetera.  Mike  : That is absolutely the information that I grew up with, that unions were like this okay idea. But the auto unions had gotten way too radical and the teacher's unions, you couldn't fire anybody.\\xa0  Sarah:   Right.  Mike  : The public transit unions would go on strike and completely cripple cities. I mean, this was completely the rhetorical waters that I grew up in.  Sarah  : And then coming into adulthood as a millennial and a workforce that is very different from the workforce, you know, that I was raised by much like the characters in   Newsies   like wouldn't it be nice if we had a union to protect us.  Mike  : Hmmm.  Sarah  :\\xa0 And I feel as if there's, there's something about the millennial experience of being a content worker. That the people who made   Newsies   could not have anticipated, we’d resonate so deeply with the children that they made this movie for, because the, I mean, Mike, what does it mean to be in the business of creating content as a member of the millennial workforce?\\xa0  Mike  : You're like a gig worker, you do jobs for magazines and newspapers, and you agree on a price and then you write an article.\\xa0 And then they publish the article and then you harass them to pay you and it takes, I waited 18 months once to get paid for an article. And then, you know, you don't get health insurance, you don't get retirement benefits, you don't get disability. If you get the flu for two weeks, you don't get money for two weeks.\\xa0 I mean, it's just complete precarity.\\xa0  Sarah:  \\xa0 You know, another example is academia. The majority of university courses in the United States are taught by non-tenure trac faculty.  Mike  : Right.  Sarah  : Being an adjunct is essentially being a contractor at a university.  Mike  : Yes.  Sarah  : Adjuncts in academia usually don't know if they're going to have a course the following semester, even if they're teaching courses now. And it's also common to be teaching at multiple institutions. When I was adjuncting at my Alma mater, Portland State, I and all the other adjuncts were kept at 0.49 FTE, which meant that we were slightly below the half time that we would have to be at to get health insurance.\\xa0  Mike  : It’s so dark, this is so common.\\xa0 When I used to be a contractor for Microsoft, they had a deal with the U.S. Justice Department over exactly these practices of basically using contractors as if they were full-time employees. And what they had to do is every year they would fire you and they would wait a hundred days and then hire you back. \\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah.  Mike  : That was what the justice department said, that if somebody is employed for more than a year, then you have to start treating them as an employee. And so instead of treating these people as employees, Microsoft was like, no, we're just going to create this baroque clockwork, weird system where we fire people for the minimum amount possible and then rehire them back over and over again.\\xa0 And I had colleagues who had done this for like eight years in a row.  Sarah:   It's just that you're never really fully there.\\xa0  Mike  : Yup.  Sarah:   There are a huge number of gig workers in today's economy.  Mike  : There's also a huge class of workers that are not gig workers, but still exist in the same precarity. The example you always hear is that a company like GM, you know, they have these massive factories, they have these huge operations with all these ancillary services and so there was a time when all of the cafeteria workers and like people who did laundry at GM, those all would have been GM employees, so they would have had similar pay scales. They would have been on the ladder to get promotions elsewhere into the company, and they could work themselves up into more corporate style jobs.\\xa0 Whereas now most large companies, everything is outsourced. So, all of the cafeteria workers at Apple’s main campus in California, they're not Apple employees, they're employees of like Food Services International LTD, or whatever. A lot of those people are making very low wages and they don't really have a ladder into these more stable forms of employment.\\xa0 Like there's no promotion. If you're somebody who cleans office buildings at night or hotels at night, you can't get promoted to like Westin Hotels corporate.  Sarah  : Yeah.\\xa0  Mike  : Because you're just on a completely different ladder.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, and I feel as if people who run companies aren't always as stupid as they look. And I think they know what kind of conditions breed solidarity between workers and what kind of conditions make it much harder.  Mike  : Yeah.  Sarah  : And make organizing harder.  Mike  : It's funny, I was just reading a policy PDF on this the other day and in the back and the recommendations, one of the bullet points was what needs to change is there needs to be a series of strapping, young teenage boys who are singing and dancing and talking about these conditions.  Sarah:   I think that that's often what we're missing. And so this movie did very poorly when it was released. It was in theaters for either weeks or days.  Mike  : I actually remember it coming out.  Sarah  : Really.  Mike  : I remember as a kid wanting to see it, and by the time I sort of got up the gumption to actually make moves to go see it, it was gone.  Sarah:   That’s the story of   Newsies  . Like three days later, everyone was like, “Whatever happened in   Newsies  ?”  Mike  : Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : And my understanding of the   Newsies   story is that that's, you know, what happened when it was released theatrically. And then it was released on video and like a lot of movies in the nineties, including   The Princess Bride  , like slowly became a classic on the rental market.\\xa0  Mike  : Hmmm, yeah.  Sarah  : And tween and teen girls such as myself and, you know, non-girls but boy, a heck of a lot of girls were drawn to this movie because it was about boys. And they danced and they sang and they had feelings. And then also because of that, we were drawn into the story of workers' rights and how you must violently defend them if necessary. I for a long time thought that that's the most wonderful thing that's ever happened.\\xa0 And so I recently started researching the actual Newsboys’ Strike because for a long time, I've had these ideas of like, it would be fun to do an episode on the Newsboys’ Strike, it would be fun to do an episode on the   Titanic  , like the historical Titanic. Because put them off because like, cause they sound fun and I'm not allowed to do fun things.  Sarah  : So, yeah, we're doing the Newsboys’ Strike now.\\xa0  Mike  : Wait, why are you allowed to do fun things?  Sarah  : I have a Puritan ancestor named Lancelot Granger, there's not a lot of fun coursing through these veins.\\xa0  Mike  : So where do we start on this Newsboys’ Strike?  Sarah  : Ok.  Mike  : Or maybe news people, I don't know what the situation was.\\xa0  Sarah  : Your question reminds me of a great interview that I found on C-SPAN, when Vincent DiGirolamo, who wrote a book that I am relying on for quite a lot of my research on this topic called ‘  Crying the News  ’, which is about newsboys. And so, the interviewer asks him, “Who are the newsboys?”\\xa0 And he's like, “Well, they're boys and girls and old women?”  Mike  : Oh.  Sarah  : And all kinds of people. Basically being a newsboy means that you sell the news, and the majority of those workers were children and youths, basically.\\xa0 The majority of them were male, but there were a lot of girls, there were adults doing it. But in answer to the question of “Who are the Newsies?”, I want to bring up an article that I actually read in my first ever grad school lit class with Maude Hines at PSU, which is by an author named Karen Sanchez Eppler, who's an American studies professor at Amherst. It's very interesting to look at the way that child workers and children who have, you know, who are existing in this interesting complex gray area. Because on one hand, they’re child laborers. And we understand that the forces of capital are exploiting them and that this is one of the problems with the society that we have.  Mike  : Ummm.  Sarah  : And yet also we see people feeling not just concerned for the newsies, but anxious about the newsies because newsies have power,     newsies have an unusual amount of agency for child laborers, because they actually do make enough money that they can have something aside from the bare bones to spend on themselves. And they can purchase amusements, and they can purchase, you know, this is the exact same scripts recur over time. So, there's a lot of concern over the newsies spending too much money on fine food and cigars to advance themselves. And it's like, they are teenage boys, they have put in their hours, let them. I mean, I'm not a fan of children smoking, but like it was 1899, everyone just babies smoked, you know? So it's not about health, is it?\\xa0  Mike  : So, candy was the 1890s equivalent of Fortnite.  Sarah  : I feel like it's that same policing that we see as a way to distract people from sort of the inexorability of class status in the United States. This idea that if poor people would only save their money and be responsible, then they would be able to climb the ladder.\\xa0 And it's like, no, you basically end up where you were born in this country, if not a few rungs below that. And you might as well just get comfortable on the rung you're on. Like, it's not illogical for people to behave that way, and it's gaslighting to imply that it's possible to escape a sinkhole, but everyone knows is inescapable.  Mike  : I think the idea that guilty pleasures or any pleasures really are something you have to earn if you're not sort of an upstanding member of society, whatever that means. That you don't get to have things like treats or you don't get to watch entertainment that is diverting.  Sarah  : Yeah.  Mike  : It's like, no, no, you should be doing something intellectually diligent, even though that's not a standard that we apply to rich people.  Sarah:   It’s weird, right? It's like you get to a certain point and then you can do whatever you want.  Mike:   Right.  Sarah:   And then before that, like if you buy like some nice yogurt for yourself, then there's going to be some op-ed column that’s being like, “You'll never pay off your student loans if you buy the nice yogurt.”  Mike  : Right.  Sarah  : And it's like, I mean, it's funny to me because I think, you know, my problem with the sort of Disney ethos is that it, you know, the moral of Disney is believing in yourself and your dreams will come true. Which is kind of the American aphorism or whatever. And it's perfect for us because it's vague enough that like, if you're a fascist and your dream is to be a fascist, than like, sure, whatever. That's great because it's a very value, neutral sentiment. It's like, you know, no matter what your dreams are, like, they're equally valid because of their dreams.\\xa0  Mike  : Right.  Sarah:   And so somehow a dream of socialism really slipped right through the net. So that could have been the best thing that happened in the nineties.\\xa0 You know, I'm on the fence about it, but this is from the second annual report of the   Children's Aid Society   by Charles Loring Brace is quoted and Karen Sanchez Eppler’s article, which is called   Playing at Class  .\\xa0 And Grace writes, “  The class of Newsboys were then apparently the most wild and vicious set of lads in the city.\\xa0 Many of them had no home and slept under steps, in boxes, or in corners of the printing house stairways,”   I'm laughing because I guess it feels like it cause describing stray cats  .\\xa0 “Their money, which was easily earned was more quickly spent in gambling, theaters and low pleasures for which though children, they had a man's aptitude.”   \\xa0I feel like this is like getting into some of your sweet spots, actually, because we're taking like workers' rights, working conditions and, and child labor and homelessness and homeless youths, as concepts that society fails to understand. And this nets together all of them and then his takes us back in time a hundred years.  Mike  : But do you think there's something interesting about the sort of societal conception of child labor? That something that we had to invent in some ways, because for a really long-time child labor just meant kids working on farms and kids helping out their parents. So the discourse for a very long time was like, I don't think we need this label ‘child labor’, because children do labor all the time.\\xa0 Like that's the nature of childhood in America is a lot of labor.\\xa0  So, it took a really long time for us to sort of drive in that distinction between sort of exploitative, capitalistic labor, like the kind that we're talking about with the newsies or factory work or in mines and the kind of family labor.\\xa0 Like we still have trouble with that line today. I don't know where we were on that spectrum in 1890s, but the idea of children working was not like inherently offensive to humans for a very long time.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh, yeah. Part of paradigm shift that had to happen for people was conceiving of children as human beings, right?\\xa0 Because we've talked in our   Stranger Danger   episode about how the concept of child abuse didn't exist until such a time as it became necessary to come up with a charge that you could use to remove a child from an unsafe situation. And you know, the closest thing was animal abuse, animal abuse existed before child abuse did as something that was legally defined.  Mike  : But, so how did these kids end up homeless? Like whose kids were these, the newsies?\\xa0  Sarah:   One of the interesting “you’re wrong” about newsies is that most of them weren't homeless.\\xa0  Mike  : Oh yeah.\\xa0  Sarah  : I'm talking about huge swaths of time. This is like over a century worth of the history here, but at the time of the Newsboys’ Strike, I mean, I think one of the things that the movie   Newsies   actually fails to represent accurately is that a large number of these boys had families that they went home to, had schools that they went to, and then would sell an early edition before school and sell the afternoon edition after they got out of school. And then a lot of them also were living in the newsboys lodging houses.\\xa0 But these were kids who also had families that they were going to and bringing their wages to, and that they were expected to help. And they were doing this partly as their way of contributing to the family.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah.  Sarah  : So, the idea here that we're getting with this idea of like this newsboy has stray cats sleeping in boxes under the stairs is that the newsboys lodging house are these important institutions through which we can reach and shape these young, impressionable boys on the rhetoric that we see a lot of at the time is that. You know, it is up to the adults and to their economic patrons, basically to ensure that they don't go down the path to criminality, to stop them from wasting their money gambling. And basically, I don't know, it seems like managing a boy band basically.  Mike  : Yeah.  Sarah:   So, Sanchez Eppler writes,   “Frederick Starr explains that at the Philadelphia newsboys lodging house panes is taken gradually to refine their tastes by entertaining lectures, readings, dramatic, or otherwise, and innocent games. Get the lodging house game he describes with greatest detail does not appear very likely to refine its players.”   \\xa0And Starr says,   “A certain game admitting of no other euphemism and its suggested title has possession of the floor. This is no other than the pile of maggots. The rule is for all to quote pile in, the best fellow keeping on top without injuring his competitors. Of course, the party he supposes himself upper most has, but brief time for exaltation. Soon finding himself at the bottom of the heap.\\xa0 The struggle is generally a short duration for, as the fund grows fast and furious. The smaller boys shouting ouch get off of me, fellers, the superintendent taps, a bell and all his quiescent, instanter.”\\xa0   \\xa0I just feel that it's important to contextualize the newsies as these young adults, many of them, children who adult reformers are interested in and trying to shape and to mold.\\xa0 And at the end of the day, they are teenagers who want to jump in a big pile.\\xa0 And I think that this all part of why the strike was successful, because this was a strike that feels like it had the energy and the character of the young in it.\\xa0  Mike  : So how did this job work? You stand on the corner and you say, I've got the   Herald   5 cents or whatever, and people buy it.\\xa0 And then you do get paid on commission or do you get paid hourly?\\xa0  Sarah  : It's just so funny to me that you haven't seen   Newsies   and just like Mike, every schoolgirl knows that the way being a newsboy and the 19th century works is that you buy your papers from the distributor. So, in   Newsies  , the prices that they're dealing with are half a cent per paper, and then they sell them for a penny.\\xa0 And so, if you buy a hundred papers, you spend $0.50 cents. You sell them all for a dollar total, you get a $0.50 cent profit.  Mike  : Okay.\\xa0  Sarah  : So, you're in control of the profit margin. You are actually an independent worker.  Mike  : But it also means that if you have a slow day and you don't sell all 100 papers that you bought from the distributor, it's you that suffers, not the distributor or the newspaper. Because they've already sold it to the middleman.\\xa0  Sarah:   Hence the lyrics and the opening song of   Newsies, “I got to find an angle, I got to sell more papes.”  \\xa0 So, the Newsboy’s Strike comes along about in 1899, when basically Hearst and Pulitzer decide to raise the price of the papers for the newsies.  Mike  : Ooh.  Sarah  : So, if I'm a newsie and I'm buying a hundred papers a day, then I have a $0.050 cent turnaround. The proposed raise and the price that I'm going to pay to get my papers is from $0.05 cents for 10 papers or half a cent per paper to $0.06 cents per 10 papers, which means I'm now spending $0.60 cents for my papers and making a $0.40 cent profit.\\xa0  Mike  : Which is a huge, huge cut in your profits.  Sarah  : Yes, and interestingly, all of this happens partly because of the   Spanish American War  .\\xa0  Mike  : Oh.  Sarah  : So, this is from David Nasaw,   Children of the City  , which inspired   Newsies  ,   “The event that was to lead to the newsies strike of 1899 was the wholesale price increase that Hearst's Journal and Pulitzer's World had instituted in 1898 at the height of the Spanish American War circulation boom. The publishers, especially Hearst & Pulitzer have been spending far more money competing with one another and extra additions, flashy front pages and eyewitness reports, than they could hope to recoup an advertising and sales. By raising prices to newsies from $0.05 cents to $0.06 cents for 10 papers, they expected to reduce their losses to manageable levels.\\xa0 The boys, as long as they were making money hawking extra additions with horror story front pages did not protest the price increase  .”\\xa0 And so the newsboys can cope with this price increase for as long as the war is still happening and as long as they have the splashy headlines.\\xa0  Mike  : Ahhh.\\xa0  Sarah  : But the war ends and then they're still making $0.40 cents for every hundred papers they sell, but maybe you can't sell a hundred papers when there isn't a war happening.  Mike  : Right, that makes sense. So once public interest deflates the industry, sort of as a whole, they realize what has just happened.\\xa0  Sarah  : And I actually have prepared for you, so the Newsboys’ Strike begins in July of 1899. I'm going to send you a couple of front pages from right before the strike, and I want us to play a game where you can imagine that you're a newsboy and that you have to sell this paper.  Mike:   Oh God!  Sarah  : This is a front page in the New York Times from June 30th, 1899 and we'll have a link to this in show notes.  Mike  : For fuck’s sake, the graphic design. Jesus. There's just like a million columns and the headlines are like barely larger than the actual text.\\xa0  Sarah  : We’ve all been wondering when there was a time when nothing was happening, and it turns out its June 1899.  Mike  : Yeah, I don't even know what I'm looking at here, there's like 50 stories on the front page.  Sarah  : And none of them seem to be more important than the others.\\xa0  Mike  : I know, my little millennial brain needs some sort of prioritization of information.\\xa0  Sarah  : I know you talk about clickbait, but it turns out that like a passionate list of everything that happened today is not actually better.\\xa0 Like the front page of a newspaper shouldn't give you a bunch of headlines that make you go, “Oh yeah, okay.” The biggest headline just says, “  Harvard's Day of Triumph - Victorious in All Three Boat Races with Yale”.   Like that's actually the biggest headlines.\\xa0  Mike  : Yeah, that is really appealing to these Simpsons writer's demographic.  Sarah  : I get the sense that the   New York Times   has always struggled with the concept of relevancy. Page five, “  The Norwegian Steamer Crim which arrived here from Cuba yesterday had a case of yellow fever on board.”  \\xa0  Mike:   Also, a lot of the stories seem kind of low key, not news. Like one of them just says, “  Death Leads to Marriage in Chicago  ”.  Sarah  : That could just be a tourism slogan for Chicago. Welcome to Chicago, where death leads to marriage.\\xa0  Mike  : So, it says Chicago, June 29th, Peter W. Hanson and someone, someone whose name is ripped off, both of Racine, Wisconsin were married here today. The bride was the widow of the Reverend Jay Tope, a Baptist minister of Racine who died suddenly some time ago from overexertion in riding a bicycle.\\xa0  Sarah:   Awww. \\xa0  Mike  : Mr. Hanson, who was an ex-policeman, was called to sit on the coroner's jury, which investigated the death. He soon became interested in the young woman and she in turn found him attractive. The outcome of this romantic attachment was the procuring of the marriage license in Chicago.\\xa0  Sarah  : “Extree, extree lady gets married.”  Mike  : So, this is what the Newsboys had to sort of sex up to get people to buy on the street corners, basically.  Sarah  :\\xa0 So, one of the practices for which Newsboys are notorious, is spinning a story into something bigger and more interesting to try and get people to purchase their paper. So, if I were a newsboy, I would say “Extree, extree, yellow fever outbreak.”  Mike  : Yeah, the one about the lady marrying the guy, you could pretend that the dude killed the guy on the bike.  Sarah  : Or you could say “Extree, extree, man murdered by invention”.\\xa0 I'm showing you all this to impress upon you, to me, the sense of dismay that would perhaps come over you as you sit down to look at the headlines and to try and sell this fucking thing and to do it 100 times today.  Mike  : So, the Newsboys just all got together and decided we're not going to go pick up the papers from the warehouse today?  Sarah  : Well, let me answer you with another quote. So, Nasaw writes,   “It is difficult to say where or precisely how the strike began. The first reported actions took place in Long Island City, where the Newsies discovered that the journal delivery man had been cheating them.\\xa0 On July 18th, they took the revenge by tipping over his wagon, running off with his papers, and chasing him out of town.\\xa0  Mike  : Woah.  Sarah:   And then word of this travels to the Manhattan newsies, who on July 19th the following day holds an assembly at City Hall Park, and announced their intentions to strike the following day.\\xa0  Mike: Mmmm.  Sarah  : They say, give us back our original prices, our pre-war prices, $0.50 cents for a hundred papers.\\xa0 And if you don't and we're striking, they're essentially holding their labor hostage. Which I guess is what a strike is, but I just felt the need to say that I guess. So, what appears to have happened is that there was a relatively small action on Long Island City, word travels to newsies closer to the distribution points that they need to take out and closer to the bosses that they need to communicate with.\\xa0 I feel like this is how we see protests happen today. Like there's smaller events that precipitate the larger and more decisive ones and also that they're often parallel evolution happening in different neighborhoods or different parts of the country.\\xa0  Mike:   Yeah, it's interesting that when conservative politicians talk about a thousand points of light or the big society, they don't mean trade union strikes. They don't mean direct action.  Sarah:  \\xa0 Anyway, let’s watch a number from   Newsies  ?  Mike:   Oooh.  Sarah  :\\xa0 This is a historic moment, Mike. I feel in a way that all my life has been leading up to this. But I say that whenever I show   Newsie  s to someone for the first time. So this is the scene where they are, we are learning through the language of musicals, they've decided to go on strike. And so, the way that the creators of   Newsies   have compressed the sort of disparate opening story, where it starts in Long Island City and Manhattan takes notice and et cetera, is to just have two characters who are the sort of Moses and Aaron combo through the dialogue between these two characters we kind of get a series of skits on what a union is and how to make it, and then, and then express all that through song.  Mike  : Hell yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   Three, two, one, go.  (Song from   Newsies,   The World We Know  )  \\xa0  “Pulitzer and Hearst, they think we're nothin'. Are we nothin'?”  “No!”  “We stick together like the tribal elders and they can't break us up”  “Pulitzer and Hearst they think they got us. Do they got us?”  “No!”  “We’re a union now, the Newsboys’ union, we gotta start acting like a union.”  “Even though we ain't got hats or badges, We're a union just by sayin' so...  And the world will know!”  “What's gonna stop someone else for selling our papes?” \\xa0 “What’s wrong with them?” \\xa0  “Some of them don’t hear so good.” \\xa0  “Well, then we’ll soak um.”\\xa0  “No, we can't be those kids in the street, that will give us a bad name.”\\xa0 “Can’t get any worse!”\\xa0  “What's it gonna take to stop the wagons? Are we ready?”  “Yeah!”  “No!”  “What's it gonna take to stop the scabbers? Can we, do it?”  “Yeah!”  “We'll do what we gotta do until we break the will of mighty Bill and Joe...”  “And the world will know! And the Journal, too! Mister Hearst and Pulitzer, have we got news for you!” The world will hear what we got to say. 'Stead of hawkin' headlines we'll be makin' 'em today. And our ranks will grow”  “And we'll kick their rear!”  “And the world will know that we been here!”  Sarah  : Impressions?  Mike  : It was poifect. No, I'm realizing, okay, I'm realizing why I have not seen this as an adult. No offense to anyone involved in this film or anyone who likes this film.\\xa0  Sarah  : Oh boy.\\xa0  Mike  : Two of the things that induce involuntary shuttering cringe responses for me are, A) singing, and B) child actors.  Sarah  : Yeah.\\xa0  Mike  : It’s like physically difficult for me to watch this.  Sarah  : Any singing?  Mike  : Basically.  Sarah  : Really.  Mike  : Especially people looking at the camera and singing.  Sarah  : You can't watch any ABBA videos.  Mike  : I know.  Sarah  : But yeah, 90% of this movie is kids singing. It is worth talking about why this movie is what it is. Right? Because I feel like it's like, it's a weird thing for Disney to have decided to do.  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : It wasn't going to be a musical and then they're like, “Let's make it a musical. And then maybe that will make it less weird”.\\xa0 And then they're like, “Cool, we're going to get some kids who can sing and some kids who can do gymnastics. And some kids who can act and almost none of them will be the same kids.”  Mike  : It's funny, Christian Bale's never sung since this.\\xa0  Sarah  : He did not know it was going to be a musical when he agreed to do it. And I still feel sad for that betrayal happening.  Mike  : I know. What was that conversation like? Christian. quick thing...  Sarah  : But like the lyrics are, I mean, they are very labor rightsy. Like Pulitzer may own the world, but he don’t own us. And then in another song, you know, one of the lyrics is,   “Nothing can break us, no one can make us give our rights away  ” which is like this very radical core concept that you as a child worker intrinsically have rights that you have workers' rights and that you have the sovereign power as an individual.  Mike  : There's also, I mean, I think it was something along the lines of, “We're in a union when we say we're in a union”. It's something that exists because a large group of people say it exists and take it seriously.  Sarah  : Yeah.  Mike  : Which is also, I mean, that's basically what governments are. That's what currency is. That's what police forces are.\\xa0 I mean, a lot of the sort of core concepts of modern life are actually the same structure that if a bunch of people say that this thing exists, then it does meaningfully exist.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah.  Mike  : It's also kind of radical for people in positions like these, to just be able to say it like look, all, all it takes is for all of us to believe in this thing and then it will happen.\\xa0  Sarah  : I really love the irony of the fact that the newsies are this fixation of benevolence societies. And there's this idea that they exist in this precarious space and they must be shaped and to wholesome young adults. And really, it's like, I think the lack of shaping partly that makes them capable of grasping these ideas.  Mike  : Mmm.  Sarah  : Because if they were more shaped by the world and they have been, then they would have been adjusted maybe more fully to a world where it's obvious that they don't have rights. Because workers don't really have rights and children definitely don't.  Mike  : Yeah, and they would have been playing checkers instead of blackjack.  Sarah  : Instead of pile of maggots.\\xa0  Mike  : Instead of pile maggots. Yes, so what happens, what ends up happening with the strike?  Sarah  : So, July 19, they rally and City Hall Park, they announced that they're going to go on strike unless the prices are rolled back to $0.50 cents per a hundred papers.\\xa0 And then they go about doing the business of starting a union so this is another Nasaw quote, “  Officers were elected a committee on discipline chosen a strategy debated and delegates sent out to spread the word to the newsies at 59th street and in Harlem, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Jersey.”  Mike:   Wow, and all before the subway.  Sarah  : I know, and they're traveling on foot. Yes, like I'm sure there's ferries and I don't know, you can like Marty McFly onto like a slow-moving car or something like that.\\xa0  Mike  : City bike system.\\xa0  Sarah  : The newsies acted swiftly, not because they were children, but because the moment was fortuitous. The Brooklyn streetcar operators were already on strike, and though they would ultimately be defeated, they were for the latter part of July tying up the police so tight there were few left on the downtown Manhattan streets.\\xa0  Mike  : Nice.  Sarah  : They're being strategic about it too, and they understand that there just isn't going to be enough adult authority to intervene in the kind of wall that they're going to put up between the newspapers and their customers.  Mike  : So, it's basically the dancing montage from the Breakfast Club, except it's like an entire sector of the economy.  Sarah  : So they demand that their prices be rolled back. They strategized that the police will be otherwise occupied, and all that is left is for Hearst and Pulitzer to meet their demands. Which obviously they don't, because it's a bunch of kids who cares what they say.  Mike  : Yes.\\xa0  Sarah  : So, this is the way   The Sun   reported on the first day of the strike,   “Fully a hundred boys were gathered in park row at the hour when the first additions of the yellows usually come out and as soon as the wagon started there was a great howl and a shower of missiles, which made the drivers' jobs uncomfortable.\\xa0 The police came on the run and the boys scattered hastily. For an order had gone out, it has said that the police are not to be injured. All the boys were armed with clubs and most of them were in their head gear placards, denouncing the scab extras and calling on the public to boycott them  .”  Mike  : Yoooo!  \\xa0  Sarah  : So, they try to stop the wagons from coming out. They do end up scattering because the strike leaders themselves have decided that they're not going to assault the police. And then the delivery drivers go out and then are met at their individual distribution points around the city, by the newsies.\\xa0  So again, here's another   The Sun   quote about a group estimated at four or five hundred newsboys who were at the 59th street distribution point.   “They had decorated the newsstands and lampposts with banners inscribed, ‘Please don't buy the World or Journal help the newsboys our cause is just. We will fight for our rights and other pregnant sentiments.”  Mike  : Ok.  Sarah  : “  As soon as the wagons came up, the boys press forward and began to hoot and howl though pushed back by the policemen they did not scatter. They formed a circle and as fast as any man got his bundle of papers and tried to get away with them, they sweep down upon him with yells of kill the scab. Mauled him until he dropped his papers and ran then tore the sheets into small bits and trampled them in the mud.”  Mike  : This is also a time in American history, when people really did resolve arguments with brawling, quite a bit more than we have now.\\xa0  Sarah:   That’s such a good point because I know we love to act as if the world is getting more violent and yet statistics say that it isn't.  Mike:   Yeah.\\xa0  Sarah:   I guess that the fact that, you know, everyone was dehydrated the whole time until 1960 so   The Sun   reports on an incident where a young newsboy, they don't say the age, but like a kid, a child is getting his papers from a distribution point and is being guarded by a police officer. And so the newsboys strategize how to deal with this and one of them is named Mush Myers, which is the name he used for character in   Newsies  . Young Mush suggests that he will snatch some of the kid’s papers and run and get the cop to chase after him and then the other newsies can go after the kid.  Mike:   Nice.  Sarah  : Which is what happens. They go after the kid, they attack him, and then he joins up with them and is spotted working for the newsies like an hour later.  Mike  : Heeeey.  Sarah  : And   The Sun,   who's reporting on this - this is my favorite thing - calls the policemen who are trying to interfere with the Newsboys’ Strike, Blue Coated Servants of Capitol.  Mike  : Nice.  Sarah:   You do not get that in the mainstream newspapers these days. \\xa0  Mike:   Soldiers of enforcing segregation, yes.\\xa0  Sarah:   So here again is a quote from   Children of the City   and this is a description of how quickly the strike escalates.\\xa0   “Joseph Pulitzer, nearly blind, so sensitive to sound he exploded when the silverware was rattled, managed his newspapers and of absentia for the last 20 years of his life. Nearly every day, he received memos from the New York world office, providing him with the information he required.\\xa0 In July of 1899, a new subject appeared in the memos. The Newsboys’ Strike has grown into a menacing affair. It is proving a serious problem, practically all of the boys in New York and adjacent towns had quit selling. By the 24th panic had set in, the advertisers have abandoned the papers and the sale has been cut down fully 2/5. \\xa0 It is really a very extraordinary demonstration.”\\xa0  Sarah  : And so, the turning point comes on July 24 when basically the papers have been so compromised and their ability to distribute that advertisers decide to pull their money.\\xa0  Mike  : Oh, soooo, this is very capitalistic.\\xa0  Sarah  : Yeah, exactly. And that's what happens because apparently this is when Pulitzer and Hearst start to take it seriously and this is when they start seeing the Newsboys as a real threat and they played dirty back against them. And so, this is the cliffhanger I'm going to leave us at for now.\\xa0  Mike:   Oh, to be continued.  Sarah  : Oh, thank you, Mike, for joining me on this weird loopy journey, because I feel like this is kind of an odd, this is kind of a weird one.  Mike:   This is fun.  Sarah  : I guess I feel like something that I love this deeply, and that depresses me so little, can't possibly be good for me.\\xa0  Mike  : I think this is right and good and wonderful. I think it is important to find shiny objects in the past to distract ourselves with like jingling keys in front of a baby.  Sarah  : Yeah, this is something that makes me happy.\\xa0 This is a movie that has meant a lot to me for a long time. I look back on it now as, as really the only reason that I grew up hearing anything about worker's rights and about the labor unions and labor organizing that reflects the reality that is now very, obviously all around us.\\xa0  Mike  : Right.\\xa0  Sarah:   And I don't know, this is a story where people try really hard to do something together and it works out and I wanted to do one of those.  Mike  : I wholeheartedly approved, I think at least 5% or 6% of our episodes shouldn't be horrifically depressing.  Sarah  : So, this is a quote from Spot Conlon, who is described in this book as district master work boy of the Brooklyn union and is familiar to anyone who's a fan of   Newsies   for his appearance there. So in   Children of the City  , we hear,   “Spot Conlon hired in pink suspenders walked across the Brooklyn bridge with greetings and promises of support.  \\xa0   “We have tied up the scab sheets so tight that you can't buy one for a dollar in the street, hold out my gallant kids and tomorrow I myself at the head of 3000 Nobel hearts from Brooklyn, we'll be over here to help you use when your Nobel scrap for freedom and fair play.”  Mike:   Hell yeah kids, see Spot strike.  Sarah  : So the question now is, now that the adults are taking the strike seriously, what are they going to do?\\xa0 How is it going to resolve? Can these papers be distributed without newsies? And what happens to the strike, and what happens to the newsies after it?\\xa0  Mike:   And after all this is the trade union still going to woik?\"],\n",

       "\"Sarah:   You're very white too. You're like a little Victorian ghost boy.  Mike:   Welcome to   You're Wrong About   the podcast that occasionally spins off into other podcasts.  Sarah:   I think people have been describing this as an   Avengers   type situation, which I support because I want to be   Ant Man  .  Mike:   If I had to pick an Avenger for you, it would absolutely be Ant Man.  Sarah:   Okay. And so you have created a new podcast called   Maintenance Phase  . And which Avenger are you and what Avenger are you working with?  Mike:   I think I would probably be Captain Marvel because she's kind of introverted and away from everything else. And then Aubrey, my co-host on Maintenance Phase, would absolutely be Captain America because she's very just pure and like the driven snow.  Sarah:   Yeah. I think those two are appropriate because of my extensive experience of the Avengers, which is seeing the first movie and the last movie and completely losing interest in the middle, those are the two characters who look at the world as it is and are like, I don't get it. But why, like, what's all this about? But, yeah, and I am excited for this podcast as a thing to exist in the world, but be, um, you know, not entirely disinterested in its success because I love you almost as much as I hate the President's Physical Fitness Test, which is the basis of your first episode.  Mike:   This is the tone that we want to strike with every episode of just likable people talking about hateful things. This is most of what we're going to do.  Sarah:   People who love each other and hate the things they're talking about.  Mike:   So, yeah. What was your experience with the President’s Physical Fitness Test?  Sarah:   Well, my event was the sit and reach, because I have very long arms. I have long legs, but I have longer arms and I have long ET fingers. And so I would just sit and reach, and I would actually push the little pusher thing. My fingers would go pass the farthest place you could push it because I was like 5’,10” in the sixth grade.  Mike:   You were that kid? I remember that kid. They were like,”Wwe need a different box”.  Sarah:   They didn't have a different box for me. They were like, yeah, yeah, here's your one thing you're good at once a year. We're not going to measure it properly. Yeah. Loved the sit and reach, and then everything else I was just like a bendy, floppy, hypermobile child. Like I still have only run a mile once in my life. Partly because I am so crushingly self-conscious about the way I was mocked by other children for the way I looked when I ran.  Mike:   How do you look when you run that? I did not know this about you.  Sarah:   Imagine a marionette with too much string in the joints. That's what I look like when I do anything, which like adults don't point out whenever they see you. But I am convinced that that's what they'll do cause the last time I did fitness surrounded by a bunch of people I was 11. And so part of me believes that if I walk into a gym, I will be pointed at.  Mike:   It is amazing to me that sixth graders are not right about anything. And yet we all still have their judgements of us seared into our brains.  Sarah:   I feel as if this is a situation where the fitness myths that they're being asked to shame each other into believing are propaganda created by adults, basically.  Mike:   Yes. There's also the fascinating thing that being fat is seen as this like great moral transgression. And yet subjecting kids to this thing that objectively makes them miserable, despite no evidence and ample evidence that it doesn't work, the moral valence never seems to apply to any of the adults involved. Not to spoil the episode.  Sarah:   Yeah. I think we know that the twist is not going to be that it's good actually. Yeah, no, that's good thought provoking to me because I feel like, yeah, it's like, why are gym teachers allowed to do all this stuff just because someone gave them a whistle?  Mike:   So you liked it, you enjoyed the episode?  Sarah:   Oh my God. Yeah. It was very vindicating. And also like, I don't want to spoil it, but there's a point fairly early on where we learn that the Presidential Fitness Test is connected to our sundry, mid-sanctuary anxieties. I think that's like a vague enough way to put it. And I was like, I knew it. I find it very validating just to hone in on the particular health myths that were packed into our brains when we were very young and there's clearly a lot to cover. I'm excited for this.  Mike:   So yes, we are putting this episode into your feeds and into your ears. And if you like it, you can subscribe to Maintenance Phase wherever your podcasts are. You can go find it on your telephone.  Sarah:   Go buy a hot, fresh podcast from the podcast talker who comes down your street on Monday mornings.  Mike:   Yes. Enjoy. And we will see you soon with more Diana and more You're Wrong Abouts. Your wrongs About.  Sarah:   Yours Wrong About.  Mike:   Yes.  Sarah:   Yeah. Nailed it.  Aubrey:   Hi everybody. And welcome to Maintenance Phase where we will tell you all about the hidden histories of health, wellness, and you know, your worst memories from childhood PE.  Mike:   That's remarkably accurate today, unfortunately.  Aubrey:   I don't know anyone who felt affirmed by this particular thing. I'm Aubrey Gordon. I'm a writer, and author, and fat lady about town. And I can't shut up about my new dog.  Mike:   Oh yeah. We have a special guest today sitting on your bed behind you.  Aubrey:   Yeah, that's right. Fin Diesel. I'm here with the, with my cohost, Michael Hobbes.  Mike:   Petless Michael Hobbes, a reporter for HuffPost. And today we're talking about the president's physical fitness test, which is a site of intense trauma for, it appears like 97% of American children. I've seen very few people that are like, that was great, glad I did it.  Aubrey:   I will say I have like a couple of good, like, I really liked being like a surprisingly flexible fat kid. There were a couple of things that I was really good at, but pull-ups are a nightmare that never ends.  Mike:   Unbelievable nightmare.  Aubrey:   I have a vague recollection also of being like, you have to be on the bar for like 15 seconds or 30 seconds or something. Even if you don't do one.  Mike:   That's the flexed arm hang. That was the one that I always did because I couldn't do one pull-up. Where they would lift you above the bar. Your chin was above the bar and then you just had to hold yourself there for as long as possible.  Aubrey:   Yeah, that's right.  Mike:   And like you would start shaking. It was like, it was just awful.  Aubrey:   I don't remember if the wall sit was part of that or if that was just a different thing that those PE teachers did.  Mike:   Well, as we will learn, the program wasn't very well organized. And it was kind of up to individual schools and individual teachers what they wanted to include on it. So fun fact, the rope climb was never on any official fitness test ever.  Aubrey:   What?  Mike:   Yes. There was no instruction to make kids climb a rope. They just did that because they had one. So at your school, maybe they did the wall sit because your gym teacher wanted them.  Aubrey:   Oh my God.  Mike:   That was how scientific it was.  Aubrey:   Also what kind of jerk is like these kids gotta be able to climb to the top of that rope.  Mike:   These kids need someone to look at them from below. That's the thing that helps with all of their self-esteem no matter what. Do you want to summarize? Like what is the president's physical fitness test?  Aubrey:   So the President's Physical Fitness Test. My recollection just as a consumer of it was that every classroom in the U.S. did this, and it was like a little battery of physical tests that always seemed sort of old fashioned to me. You know, you had to do a pull up and you had to do sit ups and you had to sit with your legs flat on the floor and sort of reach along a yardstick to see how many inches you could reach. We didn't have a ton of pull up bars. We had like one or two, so everybody's watching those one or two kids fail to do a pull up. And I also remember seeing kids who were like totally star athletes not be able to do some of this stuff.  Mike:   Yes. And remember how there was always like one random goth kid who was like in theater, who could just do like 55 pull-ups. I don't know what it was like, Trevor, really what? It did not correspond to kids' actual physical fitness in these like extremely obvious ways.  Aubrey:   Yes. There was a kid in our school who was super good at pull-ups and she was a Marilyn Manson superfan, and had little cat ears that she clipped into her hair every day. And she wrecked the President’s Physical Fitness Test.  Mike:   I also think a really big thing that people remember about the President's Physical Fitness Test is that it was quantitative. At the end you got an actual score. And of course, kids started competing for it. Right. Like, you can only do three pull-ups, but like I can do 12. And why can't you do as many? I mean, it was just so perfectly designed for kids to rank each other and to make fun of each other, because there was a literal number right there on the paper.  Aubrey:   You sort of publicly see people feel betrayed by their own bodies, right? With a bunch of kids who, for the most part, didn't feel comfortable being vulnerable in front of each other.  Mike:   Yeah. It was also the most vulnerable kids feeling the worst. Right? In that it was the fat kids. It was like the kids who had asthma, who their teachers made them run the mile anyway. It was specifically structured to be the most humiliating for the least well-performing kids. Right. So all of that said the purpose of this episode is to try to tell the story of the President's Physical Fitness Test, how we got it, how the justifications for it changed over time. and what happened to it. But what's really surprising about this to me is that I have researched probably 50 episodes of   You're Wrong About   by this point, I have never researched a podcast that was so difficult to find basic information.  Aubrey:   Really?  Mike:   So the President's Physical Fitness Test at one point was used by 75% of schools. This was a massive nationwide program. And yet it's amazing. You look through the old historical accounts and there'll be like the 1950s, and then George W. Bush expanded the program. And you're like, wait, isn't there some information in between JFK and George W. Bush? I'm sorry.  Aubrey:   Didn't you skip half of a century.  Mike:   So at one point I emailed one of the few researchers I found. It was a historian, literally a historian of fitness tests. I emailed him like, am I losing my mind? I cannot find any reports about this test or how it came about or what the debates were at the time. And he wrote back, and he basically said like, “Yeah, we don't do that in exercise studies”, because even in academia, everyone just accepted all of the precepts of fitness testing as gospel. Nobody really asked basic questions of like, is this helping? Should we be doing this? Are there other ways to achieve these goals?  Aubrey:   This is so bizarre. And it feels like in some ways it feels like a little encapsulation of a challenge that we have with health and wellness in general. Right.  Mike:   Oh yeah.  Aubrey:   That there is this sort of very uncritical acceptance, and you have to be able to do these things. You have to look this way. You have to have these numbers in your chart and your blood work and all that kind of stuff. Like this just is what it is and you don't question it. Right. So I don't actually know where this, uh, where this all got started. It feels very sort of like mid-century, fifties, sixties kind of time.  Mike:   Oh my God. Yes.  Aubrey:   So I'm curious, like where did this all start? And do you have any sense of what was the buildup to getting to this point to have like a national fitness test for kids?  Mike:   This is actually one of the few areas that we do know about. So the origins of this start with two doctors named Hans Kraus and Sonia Weber, who are, what was known at the time as ‘posture physicians’. This field eventually becomes basically physical therapy. There's, you know, if you have lower back pain, there's exercises that you can do and stretches that you can do. Or, you know, if your hips hurt.  Aubrey:   You're strengthening some muscles so that others can rest a little more, basically.  Mike:   Right. We had this sort of emerging physiology of like, why do so many Americans have back pain? This is something that had appeared after World War II. Basically it's like a lot of Americans were moving into sedentary jobs. And so the muscles that you're using to sort of move around and twist all these posture muscles were starting to atrophy. And so a huge number of Americans in their thirties and forties were showing up with back pain and shoulder pain and wrist pain. This was a new thing in the 1950s in America. And so these two doctors just started noticing that once they started doing these sort of sit up exercises and stretching the hamstrings and that kind of thing, oftentimes their pain would go away. And they became convinced that the real problem was that kids were not getting these skills in childhood. And so these two doctors come up with something called the Kraus Weber test, which is a six part test that is just measuring sort of your basic fitness, your basic like posture muscles. And so I'm about to tell you these six exercises, are you ready?  Aubrey:   Yes, let's do it.  Mike:   It's a very different test than the president's physical fitness test because it's not measuring a sort of peak of performance or average performance. It's just a binary test that measures minimum fitness. So each one of these exercises, you only have to do one.  Aubrey:   Okay.  Mike:   Okay. So the first one is you're lying down on your back with your legs straight, your arms, straight at your sides, and you just sit up. That's it. You're not doing 50 sit ups. You're literally just like, you're lying down. And then you, you move into a seated position. And there's also the same one, but with your knees bent and your feet on the floor, and you just sit up into a seated position.  Aubrey:   So that one's like a single sit-up, yeah.  Mike:   So then you roll over, you're lying on your stomach, and then can you raise your head, chest, and shoulders off of the ground. Kind of like a reverse crunch. And then still lying on your stomach, can you raise your feet off of the ground, yes or no? And then there's one flexibility test, which is the one we've all done a million times. You're just standing there and then you reach down, and you touch your toes for three seconds.  Aubrey:   All right.:  Mike:   And so it's a very quick test. It's a very easy test and it gives you these really useful results because it's just like, yes, yes, no, no, no, yes. And you're like, okay, this is the level of fitness that you have. This is what we need to work on.  Aubrey:   It's also really interesting because a lot of this has elements of sort of like yoga and pilates, both that is just sort of like, can your body move in these ways? Which is a very different approach than do a pull up in front of the classroom.  Mike:   Like, and it's also because it's a minimum test. There's really not a lot of ways to stratify kids from this because there's no difference between somebody who can do one sit up and somebody who can do a hundred sit-ups it's just, can you do one, yes or no? It's not designed to shame children as, as later tests will be. It's more a diagnostic tool, basically.  Aubrey:   Great. Go for it. Sounds good.  Mike:   But so in the late 1940s and early 1950s Kraus Webber, and a woman named Bonnie Prudden, who becomes a really famous exercise guru, like early exercise guru. The three of them start administering this test to thousands of school kids. And eventually in the early fifties, they go to Europe and they test 3000 kids in Switzerland, Italy, and Austria on these tests. And so the scientific result that really begins the panic that leads us to the president's physical fitness test is after these tests, they find out that 58% of U.S. kids fail at least one of these tests and only 8% of the European kids fail these tests. So Americans are failing at these like basic minimum standards of fitness, far more than the European kids.  Aubrey:   Well, and if we're talking forties and fifties, right, we're sort of like in the ramp up of the space race, it's post-World War II, there's this intense sense of like establishing the U.S. as a superpower and as like dominating on a bunch of fronts. So I could imagine that results like this would be like really alarming.  Mike:   It's like an existential crisis when these results come out. Because one of the things that they find within these tests is that there's no difference between rich kids and poor kids or urban kids and rural kids. Something is wrong with America and Europe is beating us at this.  Aubrey:   Do they ever figure out what's at the root of that? Or are there sort of decent hypotheses about why that might be?  Mike:   Yeah. Yes. So the main hypothesis for this is American decadence. So this is an article from Hahn's Kraus interpreting the results. He says,   “Europeans rely less on automobiles, school buses and elevators. European children walk miles to school, ride bicycles, hike, chop, and haul wood for home heating. In contrast, American children are largely driven in cars by their parents, confined to their own neighborhoods, and obligated to perform only easy chores such as making their own beds and setting the table. Nothing more strenuous than walking the dog or mowing the lawn.”  Aubrey:   That feels like such a little prototype of what's to come with sort of the obesity epidemic.  Mike:   Oh my God. I know.  Aubrey:   There is a really fascinating book, I think it's called,   Diet and the Disease of Civilization  . The idea that this author is sort of positing is that the way that we think about diet and exercise and weight loss and all that sort of stuff is as we were in the Garden of Eden and we have fallen. And the reason we have fallen is because of civilization, is because of cars and buses and industrialization and all of that kind of stuff. And that the solution to that is to get quote unquote, get back to something that is like, preindustrial is almost the idea with a lot of fitness stuff. Where I'm like, cool. We could get back to pre-industrial times, but also you want to think about what life expectancy was in those days.  Mike:   Right? Exactly. Yeah. They were just like eating raw meat off the ground. Like this is not necessarily a recipe for life.  Aubrey:   Yeah, that seems right.  Mike:   So eventually we find out the actual reason that European kids did so much better on the test has much more to do with practice than American decadence. If the problem was American decadence, you know, we're not walking to school anymore. We're all living in the suburbs, whatever. That's actually a pretty small slice of Americans at this point. In 1950, we still had about half of American kids were walking or biking to school. It's actually very important that in these fitness tests, we don't have a stratification between rich kids and poor kids, urban kids and rural kids, because if this was about American decadence, well, they have rich kids in Europe and they have poor kids in America.  Aubrey:   This also feels like just such a classic example of adult anxiety is getting projected onto kids. Right. That's like, okay, everything's gotten industrialized. Women are in the workplace to some degree or have been, right. We've got all these factories that were producing munitions that are now producing like dishwashers and shit like that. Like what's the human cost of not having to do this work. What's the human cost of living in cities and suburbs, right. Like I could imagine given the rate of change during that sort of post-war time that there would be a lot of anxiety to go around, and this seems like a weird place to put it.  Mike:   Oh yeah. But then, what's really interesting about the Krauss Weber test is as Kraus and Weber themselves say, this is a test that can improve with practice. So American kids who take this test and fail it and then practice at it for six weeks, will then get the same results as Europeans. There's also the question of whether this is actually measuring fitness or is it just measuring, I mean, are you somebody who does sit ups on a regular basis? European kids, the PE that they get in school is much more like calisthenics, where it's one gym teacher standing at the front of the class and they'll do 50 jumping jacks together. And then they'll stand with their arms out and the kids have to kick up their left leg and kick up the right leg. And then they'll all do 50 sit-ups together. It's very regimented and sort of militaristic. Whereas what happened with this form of physical education, because this was actually very popular in America from around the 1890s until the 1950s, Americans did this too.  But then what they found out was that this kind of exercise was really popular with the Nazis. This was a huge thing for Hitler, was this idea of sort of physical superiority, right? That it's not just enough to be white and blondes, you also have to be white and blonde and fit. And so the Nazis in Austria and Germany were doing a lot of these group exercise programs. So Americans got kind of uncomfortable with this stuff, and American schools in the 1940s started shifting over to sports. So instead of doing these calisthenics, we're going to play baseball. We're going to play football. The culture of sports shifted very quickly because we were all watching like the triumph of the will and it just got kind of creepy and weird.  Aubrey:   Well, so the interesting thing here is that this also maps on to there's a flip side of this, right? There's not just establishing superiority through this, I would imagine there's also establishing inferiority, right? You're also sort of identifying who do we not want to have around it anymore?  Mike:   Well also, so, I mean, as a guy who lived in Germany for five years and has read a lot about the Nazis over the years, it's also, I think really important to acknowledge that in authoritarian regimes, there will always be another spectrum of superiority. After you get rid of the Jews, then you're just going to start stratifying people by physical fitness. And then after you do that, you're just going to find some other reason to stratify people and get rid of the quote unquote, inferior people. This is a way of looking at the world. And so it's understandable that for American kids who have grown up playing baseball and doing these other things, they can't do sit-ups because they haven't been doing sit ups at school. And once you get them doing sit-ups at school everyday, they can do sit-ups. So there's nothing magical going on here. And the fact that, you know, kids that are playing soccer every day, you know, a couple of days a week with kids in their neighborhood, maybe they can't do a sit-up, but that doesn't mean that they're out of shape. It just means that they can't do this one specific thing.  Aubrey:   Well, and based on a thing that was like, do you have back pain, adult? How do we treat your back pain, adult, right. Today like we got to get in there early so these kids don't have back pain 20 years later, I guess. Like, I just, like, there's some missing connections here, so.  Mike:   All of us, the reason why it's called the President's Physical Fitness Test is because Eisenhower sees these results, and he's a military guy and he immediately links the fitness of American kids to America is going to have problems fighting wars if this gets any worse.  Aubrey:   That's where the rope climbing comes in.  Mike:   Okay. Yeah. And also, I don't know if this is apocryphal, but Bonnie Prudden, this later exercise guru, she gets invited to the white house and she gives Dwight Eisenhower the Kraus Weber test, and he passes and then she tells him, you know, 60% of American kids don't pass these tests  Aubrey:   And he’s like: *gasp*.    Mike:   Yeah. And so in July of 1956, Eisenhower creates the president's council on youth fitness. And one of the reasons that he wants to do this is because he wants it to be separate from all of these other government agencies. He doesn't want it to get bogged down in all of this bureaucracy. And so this is from a Sports Illustrated article in 1955. So this is the quote from his name's Frank Carston. He's a Missouri Democrat. He says, “According to Dr. Kraus, the physical fitness of American children is eight times lower than that of the physical fitness of European children. Simply on the mathematical surface this is a ridiculous statement, and I am very much surprised that you would dignify it”, which like, yes, like people should have been more skeptical of this than they were.  Aubrey:   Totally.  Mike:   He also says, “I asked the president to explore the matter through the proper governmental agencies rather than simply taking stock in Dr. Kraus’ figures”. So he's essentially saying, why are we doing this? As a completely separate thing, if this is so important, it's very strange that you're setting up this separate president's council with an executive order.  Aubrey:   Right? Why wouldn't you use like health departments? Why wouldn't you use like education departments, why wouldn't you use, like, there are vehicles that are better positioned and have more infrastructure to do this kind of thing.  Mike:   Yeah. And there's also policies that you could pass. One of the things that I think is actually really important and this really sets the template for the issue of youth fitness for the next 50 years, is that it is always conceived throughout every future president that touches this issue. It is always conceived as a) so important that we have to do something about it. We have to rally parents. We have to rally schools b) it's not important enough to change any actual laws or make any sacrifices. This is what Eisenhower says,   “I believe you and I share the feeling that more and better coordinated attention should be given to this most precious asset of our youth. By this, I do not mean that we should have an overriding federal program. The fitness of our young people is essentially a home and local community problem. Your deliberations also reveal a need for a rousing in the American people, a new awareness. Of the importance of physical and recreational activity.”   This is the Republican approach to so many things where it's like, it's really, really, really important, but not important to actually do anything about it. We're going to leave it to local communities. We're going to leave it to parents. And you know, my, my rule of thumb on this is whenever somebody says, we need a culture of X in America, we need a culture of exercise in America. That means they don't want to do anything about it. That means they want things to change spontaneously.  Aubrey:   Wait, can I tell you something? Ooh, I just turned in a new piece and the title is it's time to bring a culture of consent to diet talk. I’m the problem, Michael!  Mike:   You’re the enemy!  Aubrey:   No, but totally like I hear you right. That if you're talking about a culture of something, then there's not necessarily like a single person who's responsible.  Mike:   Yes. Yeah. One of the things that's amazing, I actually found a really fascinating article about the systemic visitation of children's play. What they find is that in the early years of this council, so right after Eisenhower sets it up, it's actually really cute and really lovely. So the first wave of this organization, what they start putting out is all these recommendations that are really about, we need to give children open-ended forms of play. And it's really important for kids to have hobbies, but it's not important what those hobbies are. So one of their, one of their first recommendations that they put out in one of these reports that comes out in 1956, it says schools should have more time equipment and personnel for physical education and should focus increased attention on children who are not athletically gifted rather than on stars. So it's already saying like, let's, let's look at the kids that need a little bit more help and let's focus on them because like the buff football jock, who's doing 24 pull-ups he really doesn't need us. It also mentioned specifically, and this is dope for 1956. It says, make sure that girls have equal opportunities for physical fitness.  Aubrey:   Whoa, Hey! That's great.  Mike:   This is from the, um, terrific article on this that I found, it says in the conference's final report to the president, the conferees offered a definition of fitness that encompasses the total person, spiritual, mental, emotional, social, cultural, as well as physical.  Aubrey:   That is like some whole child learning that is, even today can be kind of a radical approach. That's kind of bad-ass ahead of its time thinking.  Mike:   Yeah. And in their reports, they even mentioned stuff like camping and fishing and bowling, these things that are not necessarily the most athletic, right. You're not dripping sweat when you're fishing, but it's also, it's just a nice recreational activity and some kids are going to be more suited to that then they are to jogging 10 miles and that's fine.  Aubrey:   Totally.  Mike:   And this is the last time that this is going to happen in this episode, but they actually propose changes to the physical environment. That one of the things they say is that cities should start closing down streets to cars so that they create time and space for children without excessive adult oversight. They're essentially saying, let kids play in the street, let them meet their neighbors. Let them play frisbee, let them ride their bikes. It doesn't really matter what it is.  Aubrey:   I will say this is something that is, that we are sort of working toward in Portland, Oregon now, not for kids playing purposes, but for like maybe some streets should just be for bikes and pedestrians. And the freak out around that from folks who drive cars is like astronomical. So it's really fascinating to hear this, you know, coming around, you know, 60 years ago, plus 70 years ago now.  Mike:   I mean, it is this glimpse of the health and wellness rhetoric that we could have had if we hadn't diverted into this fork of weight. You know, some kids are going to like fishing and they're not going to be able to do a pull-up and fine. Like, I don't need every kid to be getting their resting heart rate above 90 beats per minute, three times a day like this, this quantification is something that has become so poisonous around all of our rhetoric or on food and health and fitness. And this was a time when basically this council explicitly resisted calls to do that. Right. They resisted the idea of testing kids. They resisted the idea of setting a baseline for fitness. They basically said, let's not tell them what kind of play we want them to do, or what play is or what it means to be fit. There's no point in doing that. Let's just give them the space.  Mike:   Yeah. Play with your army guys. Go hang out in the forest. You know what I mean? Like build weird structures that do whatever you want, like right. Like weird kid play. So I'm super curious about how we got from this point of this council resisting this kind of measurement. And then in pretty short order, it sounds like we pivot into now there's a national test.  Mike:   So what happens is, and the way that we get to the president's physical fitness test that we know today is the sort of academic expert community starts to coalesce around a new way of thinking about fitness that becomes really popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There's a guy called Charles McCloy who becomes really famous by writing a bunch of magazine articles. One of his most famous articles is called,   How About Some Muscle?   She essentially makes the same argument that Krauss was making in 1953, kids are too soft. And the problem is we don't have any measurable goals for these kids and what the hell are these president's council, whatever, whatever people are doing that, you know, they'd been doing this for a couple years and we don't even have baselines of what kids should be able well to do. And so in 1958, the president's council gives in to this changing paradigm of fitness and this increasing quantification of fitness and produces the first official U.S. government fitness tests. I'm going to read you the activities that are on it.  Aubrey:   Okay. Yes, please.  Mike:   So it has eight fitness tests. So first straight legs sit ups, standing broad jump.  They're measuring how far you can jump pull-ups for boys or modified pull-ups for girls. That's the flex arm hang. The 50 yard dash. The shuttle run. That's the thing where you pick up an eraser and then you run back and then you pick up another eraser and you basically run back and forth for a couple of minutes. There's the 600 yard run. There's a softball throw where they measure how far you can throw a softball. And then there are three aquatic tests.  Aubrey:   What are the aquatic tests?  Mike:   I could not, I could not find this out. The test says that they're optional. I've seen no literature on schools actually implementing these because like you'd have to go to a different building.  Aubrey:   Your school would have to have a pool.  Mike:   Exactly. Like what's step one. Also imagine how much worse the president's physical fitness test would have been if you had to do part of it in a fucking bathing suit. I am very glad that these have been lost to time.  Aubrey:   Totally. Although I will say I was like a swim team, fat kid. That was my, that was my activity of choice. I loved it and was like super good at it.  Mike:   Yeah. But also if we had done that, I would have had to test my percentile rank at hiding a boner, that would have been like every other boy is going to just be like wandering around the Speedo and like doing sit-ups. I'm like, ah, I don't think we're measuring what we want to be measuring here guys. So what's interesting about these tests is that nobody knows how they were put together. We don't have clear literature on sort of who proposed them specifically, but the theory that academics have come up with over the years is that all of them are linked to military prowess. So things like the long jump, the shuttle run, all of that is, you know, running through the jungles when you're invading another country. Like these are skills that you need for doing military maneuvers. Also I signed one article, they said that the soft ball throw, how far can you throw a softball? That's linked to potentially throwing grenades.  Aubrey:   Jesus.  Mike:   You don't want to get too conspiratorial about these things, but it's clear that there was a military reason, a national security reason for doing these things. So that's the sort of half tin foil hat explanation of how these exercises got in there.  Aubrey:   Do you know? I don't, I don't know why this is what just popped into my head, but this is such a bizarre thing that's like, we don't think of our children as soldiers, right? Like we're against child soldiers, but we are for child military readiness. Like if push came to shove, we do know how far that kid can throw a grenade or-  Mike:   We want to know what is his willingness to kill? So it's the late fifties, this test has been developed, but it's not really being used in that many schools. Like there's still not a national PE program. So this obscure government body has created this test, but it's not in all of the schools yet. But then what happens is JFK comes into office.  And apparently this is one of the first times this has ever been done, that right after he was elected. But before he took office, he wrote an editorial in Sports Illustrated called the Soft American, which basically lays out exactly the same argument as Krauss and Weber had made in 1953, the American kids are soft. Their fitness is bad. The fitness of kids is actually worse in 1961 than it is in 1953. So he starts out his essay by saying, “The first indication of a decline in the physical strength and ability of young Americans became apparent among U.S. soldiers in the early stages of the Korean war. Almost one out of every two young Americans was being rejected by selective service as mentally, morally, or physically unfit.”  Aubrey:   Sorry, was it physically, mentally, or morally unfit? He's going to throw in the mentally and morally and not really unpack that at all my dude?  Mike:   I know it's like how much time do we have on this show?  Aubrey:   Buddy that's all that was a big bucket to throw a lot of people into and then be like, they all just need some exercise.  Mike:   It's like really not the point there's also, but then he does the thing he ends his sports illustrated article doing the exact same thing that Eisenhower did and that every future president will do. He says, you know, this is so important. Our bodies are getting soft. We need to beat the Soviets. We need to be a vital nation, vigorous, blah, blah, blah. And then he's like, okay, here are my recommendations. Here's what we need to do to solve this problem. I'm going to read these to you,   “First establish a White House committee on health and fitness. Make the physical fitness of our youth, the direct responsibility of the department of health, education, and welfare. The governor of each state must be invited to attend the annual national youth fitness Congress.”   So it's like establish a fucking committee, invite governors to a meeting? It's so important and this is the only way we're going to beat the Soviets, but you just want to hold a bunch of meetings and bring the president's council into a different government department. And so another really important thing that he does is he establishes an award. So you probably remember this from when you were a kid that the kids who scored above the 85th percentile on all six categories of the president's physical fitness test got an achievement, or I don't know if it was like a ribbon or like a metal or whatever it was, but they would get sort of officially recognized for being one of the fittest kids at school. This was seen as a way of promoting physical education and kind of fostering friendly competition amongst kids.  Aubrey:   How friendly was it?  Mike:   I know, you could tell from the competition in quotes, like that's such an oxymoronic phrase to me “friendly competition” in schools.  Aubrey:   Also like the people who call school sports friendly competition are the people who win every quote unquote friendly competition. It's just like only the people who feel great about it, who are like, it's fine.  Mike:   But so what's amazing about this entire field is that we keep having the same moral panic about the fitness of children. Right. So we had, in the fifties, we had it again in the sixties and in the 1980s, we start getting another wave of news articles coming out, saying kids are less fit than they used to be. Kids are watching more TV. It's now getting more wrapped up in the obesity epidemic. And in TV watching, which is a decades long moral panic about children. But basically, we just get a third wave of articles coming out, being like, look how unfit our kids are.  Aubrey:   I feel like I'm going to end up, like in the style of Jerry Seinfeld having a clenched fist and rather than saying Newman, I'm going to end up saying Reagan. School fitness can't trickle down, but money has to.  Mike:   And so in the midst of all of these swirling anxieties, states start passing laws that every kid needs to get a fitness test once per year. So this is when we get the huge explosion of the president's physical fitness test being launched into schools. We also get, in 1986, a new version of the test. This is the version that you and me remember is the 1986 version. It consists of the one mile run slash walk, curl ups, basically sit ups, pull ups, the shuttle run. The V sit reach, which is this thing where you're sitting down with your legs spread and you see how far you can reach your hands forward. And then the sit and reach, which is the same thing, but your feet are together.  Aubrey:   I remember the sit and reach well, we had like a weird little like box that you put your feet into.  Mike:   Remember the box.  Aubrey:   And then there was like a yard stick, like glued to it or something. It was like a weirdly janky kind of thing.  Mike:   Super janky. And a lot of kids that actually were flexible and like did dance and stuff couldn't do that very well because it was a very specific form of flexibility.  Aubrey:   Totally. I completely forgot that the mile is part of it. I think I have blocked out the mile because it was so horrible.  Mike:   One year at my school boycotted it. And I walked as slowly as I could. And I sat down and I read a Stephen King book for like 10 minutes in the middle of it. And I remember they had to delay the start of the next class just for me, because I refused to do it. I took 27 minutes to do the mile.  Aubrey:   Oh my God. That's like the courage I wish I had. So we had at my school, it was a long path to get from the gym to the track. You had to like walk through this sort of like, this is very Pacific Northwest, you have to walk through this big, long, like sort of forest section. To get down to the track. So everyone had to go down to the track together. And when we would run the mile, you would just watch the fastest kids finish first without even really breaking a sweat. And it was reliably, there were two kids who were last, and it was me and this other fat kid who was a friend of mine. And there were two outcomes and both of them were mortifying to me. One was that many of the kids who finished first would get resentful, that they were like, had this potential free time and they couldn't walk back up to the gym and change and get that free time back.  Mike:   Because they had to sit there and watch the fat kids, which just like, is structured to encourage bullying.  Aubrey:   And the flip side of that was there were some kids who finished faster, who I think thought of themselves as nice kids. And we're absolutely trying to do a nice thing. And they would like sort of jog alongside us and be like, good job. You can do it. This is more spotlight that I do not want right now.  Mike:   It's so mortifying. I fucking remember that.  Aubrey:   It’s just such a creepy way to like, decide to be inspired by like to center your own reaction to what someone else is doing right. Rather than what they probably want and need.  Mike:   It was just so, it was just so mortifying the entire exercise. So this is also the time in the late eighties and the early nineties when schools start doing what they call body composition tests.  Aubrey:   No.  Mike:   As part of the president's physical fitness test, they started measuring kids' BMI's and they started doing skin fold tests. So there's something called the fitness gram, where they take a measurement of your skin fold on the back of your right arm and on your right calf. And they measure how thick the skin is. And that's a measurement of your body fat percentage, basically.  Aubrey:   Totally bananas.  Mike:   Totally bananas. There's also some schools that are weighing all the kids, but they only have one scale. So they have to do it in front of everybody else. And they read out the number, which is just, again, designed to shame the fattest kids.  Aubrey:   Well, and it's also like, as I'm sure it's as close as you get to a guarantee of somebody in that class getting an eating disorder.  Mike:   This is what happens when obesity becomes the frame through which we look at all health issues. It's not really about testing fitness anymore. It's about testing fatness.  Aubrey:   I'm super curious about the degree to which there is even just a shared definition at this point of like what physical fitness consists of.  Mike:   Oh my fucking God.  Aubrey:   This feels like a way of defining it through negative space. Right. It's not being fat yet, which I'm like, okay, but then what isn't though.  Mike:   This actually gets into the next section that we're going to dwell on for a while, which is the problems with the president's physical fitness test. So even on this, there's not as much academic literature as I would like, but there's actually much more on the challenges of the test and the deficiencies of the test than there is on its actual history. So as the test becomes much more popular, much more widespread, kids are being now required by law to get it every single year, studies started coming out about the fact that it's really not achieving any of its goals. And one of the reasons is that kids are not practicing the president's physical fitness test. I mean, this is something that really like made an audible click in my head when I was reading it that in middle school, we would just have gym class. And, you know, we'd play volleyball and whatever. And then one day a year we would do this dumb physical fitness test. And then we would just go back to what we were doing.  Aubrey:   Right. You weren't doing a sit and reach every month.  Mike:   Yeah. So it was basically okay, a random Wednesday. We're just going to come in, you're going to do this thing. You're going to feel like shit. And then we're never going to talk about it.  Aubrey:   And then we're going to go back to playing Dodge ball and we won't test you on your dodge ball acuity or whatever, right? Yeah.  Mike:   So it’s totally separated from any actual program. I mean, I could actually see some use in some of these things like, hey, we're going to help kids get flexible. So at the beginning of the year, we're going to do the toe touch. We’re going to do a bunch of other stretching exercises. Every single day for three months we're all going to do stretches together as a class. And at the end, we're going to test ourselves again and look how much you improved. I can see that being a pretty positive experience for kids. Like, look, you can train your body and you can become better at something. And maybe you'll find a love for like downward dogging or something. And maybe you'll continue doing that at home. Great. But it was never done like that. It was just like, you piece of shit. You can't even do one pull-up. Okay. See you next year where you're also not going to be able to do one pull-up.  Aubrey:   So like basically the lesson that we learned that sparked this whole thing, right, that European kids were getting practice in these specific things. We then did not apply for all of this time. Right. We shouldn't be allowed to be surprised by, you didn't practice a thing and then you didn't get better. That shouldn't be, that's just like people. That's just how people work.  Mike:   Totally. And another, I mean, another problem with this, and I think this is really key to almost all of these sorts of national, overall projects that we have about PE in schools is that schools, teachers were never really given very much instruction or extra resources for this. Again, it's not like this was like a six week fun program that all the kids are going to do together. And we're all going to become stronger in these specific ways. It was like, hey, PE teachers, you're required by law to give this test once a year. But we’re not really going to give you guidelines on how to do it.  How to communicate the results to kids or what the results mean. Teachers, since the 1950s, have absolutely hated this test and teachers and principals have been opposed to it from day one, but no one ever really listened to those concerns or took them seriously because like, oh, it's just teachers who cares? Only the people on whom we depend for the success of the programs. So why would we listen to them obviously? Right?  Aubrey:   Right. I mean, this is sort of like a shitty, like obstructionist term that gets thrown around a lot, but like, it is a pretty classic unfunded mandate. Yeah. Just go do a bunch of other stuff and we're not going to pay you for it. We're not going to figure it out for you. You'll figure it out for yourselves and whatever, but you should definitely be very concerned about it. Like what.  Mike:   I mean, this, this is one of my biggest shocks when I was researching this. And because I'm a methodology queen, I get really angry at stuff like this. First of all, the data that we get from the fitness tests is pretty shitty because the data is being gathered in such a poor way. Like they say, in the BMI test that a lot of kids are getting weighed, like with their jackets on or with their shoes.  Aubrey:   That’s like fat lady 101. You go into Weight Watchers, you take off as many clothes as possible. Come on. It's like these kids don't even know how to diet!  Mike:   But like this is to me is completely ridiculous that no one ever did anything with the results, the primary thing that was done with the actual numbers that were produced by millions of kids taking this test every year was they would just identify kids to get awards. So all that stuff about like percentile rankings, all of that is based on other academic studies that were done, the actual numbers that were produced by all of the surveillance of all these kids, no public health departments were plugged into that, that wasn't going to principals to like track kids over time. All of these numbers that we produced, they didn't do anything. They were just there to make us feel shitty. And then they just went into the recycling.  Aubrey:   Yeah. So they weren't even like aggregated? There wasn't even like a report?  Mike:   No!  Aubrey:   Ugh! Reagan!  Mike:   And another thing that comes up in the studies on this is that none of the actual fitness tests measured fitness. So I found a really good meta-analysis of all of the individual tasks that were the components of the president's physical fitness tests. And there's literally no evidence that the ability to do pull-ups is related to overall upper body strength.  Aubrey:   Right? If it did, no one would have any, we would all have T-Rex arms. Like of course it's not indicative of shit.  Mike:   This actually comes up in this review that it's extremely strange to pick a measure of fitness that most children cannot do. You can have a lot of different kids that cannot do a pull-up and some of those kids are extremely fit and some of those kids are extremely unfit, but because all of them are putting up the numbers zero, you're not catching any of those gradations. And so what this review finds is that pull-ups are a much better measure of body fat percentage than anything else because your body weight is inversely correlated to how many pull-ups you can do. So you're basically just measuring how fat the kids are. It's not actually useful as anything else.  Aubrey:   This is always sort of a fascinating thing when people talk about fitness where they're like, I don't know that fat guy gets winded real fast and I'm like, yeah, he's carrying 200 more pounds than you are.  Mike:   Yes. And working harder. Yes.  Aubrey:   And he's working harder every day to do everything right. I don't understand how this doesn't translate for folks, but okay.  Mike:   Basically, if we were designing a fitness test from scratch, now we would not be using any of these things because they don't actually test fitness. The studies actually mention that there's no good test for fitness of kids, generally, because when we talk about, you know, how fit should kids be? It's really difficult because what we're basically trying to do is predict things far in the future, right? Which kids are going to get heart disease, which kids are going to get lower back pain, et cetera. And so it's really difficult to tell what should kids be able to do at 12? That's going to predict what happens to them when they're 50.  Aubrey:   It is presenting itself as public health work. And what it is doing for sure is just ramping up weight stigma.  Mike:   Oh yeah. I mean, this is one of the central criticisms of the fitness test that starts showing up in the literature around 2000, especially after the implementation of no child left behind. When a lot of schools start cutting PE programs and some schools even start cutting recess because everything becomes built around standardized test scores. And so a lot of schools cut their PE programs because they have to focus on STEM or whatever, but they still have this legal requirement to do the fitness test. So a lot of schools that don't even have PE will sort of one day a year, pull all the kids aside and make them do these humiliating fitness tests and weigh them and then just send them back into school. So it's not even like this is being contextualized in a PE class. It's literally just, you're sitting all the time and then we test you and we're like, why are you so unhealthy? And then you just go back to sitting the next day.  Aubrey:   Yeah. Right. It also feels like we don't have a test once a year to see how well you can draw a still life and then defund art education. Right. Like it's like, hey man, there's a pretty clear connection here from one to the other. And the episode with this really fascinating article by Michael Gard, who's the academic who I emailed about the lack of history on the President's Physical Fitness Test. So he wrote a fascinating article called,   Why is There So Little Critical Physical Education Scholarship in the United States?   And it's basically about this problem, that the same articles with the same panic statistics keep getting published. And yet nobody seems to come to the obvious conclusion that fitness testing is not working. That there's an entire body of researchers that are looking at the data that is being produced by this and the experiences that kids are having and have been having as a result of these tests for almost 40 years now. And they're just like, well, it has to still be good. So what he says is, “  The remarkable point here is that despite these findings widespread inaccuracies, negative student and teacher perceptions, and potentially harmful practices, the authors remain apparently unshakeable in their support for fitness testing. An interesting feature of papers such as this is the way the distaste or disinterest of people toward fitness testing is almost uniformly interpreted as a matter of communication rather than substance. Indeed, despite the widely reported resistance of parents, children, and teachers in the fitness testing literature, fitness testing is presented as a settled and unassailable practice that is inherently beneficial for individuals, families, and society.”  This shit is fire emojis. He's really mad about this. And I found a bunch of articles in the literature that illustrate exactly the point that he is making. It's amazing. There's all of these papers about sort of the ongoing debate about fitness testing. And should we keep fitness testing and it's a controversial subject and what are the pros and cons? And what is amazing about them is that when they present the pros and cons of fitness testing, all of the pros are potential things of fitness testing and all of the cons are actual drawbacks.  Aubrey:   So the pros are sort of like imagined.  Mike:   Yeah, let me walk you through one of these. So one of the main sorts of literature reviews of the debate surrounding fitness testing, the data surrounding fitness testing, it lists at the end of the article, the pros and the cons. What are the good, what are the bad? What do various people say? They've read all of the literature. The first benefit that he lists is tracking the fitness of youth,   “Information concerning the distribution of scores can be used to track youth fitness over time.”   Well, they're not doing that right.  Aubrey:   In order to do that, you would have to aggregate your data somewhere.  Mike:   In order to do that, you would have to do that. This paper also does something that I think is very typical, where people substitute the benefits of fitness testing for the benefits of fitness. So they say like, well, you know, fitness is really good for kids. And it's like, yeah, fitness is really good for kids, but that doesn't mean fitness testing is good for kids, right? That's not an argument to tell kids to do pull-ups and then make them feel shitty for not being able to do a pull-up once a year. That's very distinct from like, let's all play volleyball on Wednesdays.  Aubrey:   If you want to foment a sort of commitment to fitness, a) you need a class and b) you need a class where instructors are aware of, you know, what makes kids take things in and what makes kids change their behaviors and that kind of thing. You're not going to do it by hiring a bunch of football coaches and then being like anyway, now care about fat kids.  Mike:   Another one of the main arguments for fitness testing is that we need to raise awareness of the obesity epidemic. Like this is something you see in so many articles, it's like, oh, we need to make kids aware that the obesity epidemic is a problem. And that physical fitness is good. And it's like, again, testing them and making them feel shitty is not a good approach to this.  Aubrey:   Right. I mean, it's the same reason that like, ideally if you have a math test and you have kids who have a hard time with math, you don't call them up to the front of the class and be like, Hey, look at these dummies. That's not a way that people learn, nor is it a way that people get invested.  Mike:   Yes. It's like, I think all kids should learn to read, but instead of actually giving them time to read and dedicating teachers to teaching them how to read, I'm just going to test them once a year and be like, why the fuck can't you read? That's my way of raising awareness of the importance of reading. And then this is from this literature review. It says when tests are properly administered, fitness testing provides useful information for students to determine their needs, setting goals and plan programs for improvement. Well, again, they're not doing that. So yes, if they were properly administered, sure they have the potential to do that, but that's been true since the 1950s and that potential has never been reached. So I don't see why that's really relevant. Like yeah, a lot of things have potential to be good.  Aubrey:   Yes, totally. There's a ton of potential. The question is, does a test fulfill that potential? Right? And it seems like we don't really know that.  Mike:   I mean, maybe there's a school district in America that has done fitness testing as part of an integrated program in a way that doesn't make kids feel shitty about themselves. But as far as a nationwide program and legal requirements, it's clear that this is not working. So after listing all of these potential benefits of fitness tests, things that could come to pass, but have not, they start listing the drawbacks. First one is teacher motivation and support. Teachers are not being motivated. Teachers are not supported. Teachers fucking hate this. That's a real, like, that's not a potential, that's a real thing. Teachers have disliked this test for 70 years. Right?  Aubrey:   Right. But in order to take that into account, we would have to listen to what teachers have to say about education. Michael, why would we do that? Why would we start that now?  Mike:   We'd have to ask teachers what they need. This one is amazing. The second bullet point on the cons of fitness testing is student motivation and self-esteem. Of concern or the percentage of elementary school teachers reporting that students cried during testing and the reports of high school students who had negative test experiences. So, uh, kids are fucking crying and you're like, ooh, the potential of the test is still there.  Aubrey:   Right? It's like, um, you know, what I love doing is things that make me cry in front of my peers.  Mike:   Fucking crying taking this test, teachers fucking hate it. And we're like, well, you know, it could work, but you know, we're taking no steps to make sure that it works right.  Aubrey:   And also, how else are we going to know how far a child can throw a grenade? There is essential information embedded in your mind.  Mike:   Right? So this is from yet another literature review of this debate over fitness testing that says in the fucking abstract, “There is currently no consensus on the importance, need, or impact of fitness tests on student experiences in physical education. Several studies highlight the negative impact fitness testing has on students' experiences in physical education, such as the formation of negative attitudes toward PE, decreased motivation toward PE following poor test scores, and feelings of humiliation when failing in front of peers. These findings provide compelling evidence that fitness test experiences do little to promote positive feelings about lifelong physical activity and fitness.” So even on its own terms, even if you're using fitness testing as a way of quote unquote, raising awareness about the need for kids to move and the badness of the obesity epidemic, et cetera, even on those terms, it's not fulfilling its mission, because people are doing this and they're feeling discouraged from doing physical activity because their experience was so bad.  Aubrey:   I would say for me personally, not only did these fitness tests not incentivize physical fitness, they attach trauma to it. So like deeply increased my, like, I was like a pretty active kid until this kind of shit kicked in where it was, became the sort of social rankings stuff. So like now when I am active, which I like I'm relatively active, right. I have to do it in ways that don't remind me of gym class, right? There's a reason I've never done another fucking pull up in my life. There's a reason I don't like stand around my house doing wall sits. Right. The reason that all of these things are like, I don't engage with them remotely anymore.  Mike:   And also, I mean, Michael Gard, this researcher, one of the only skeptical researchers on this entire field. He has an entire book about how we have tried for decades to use schools as public health promotion devices. D.A.R.E is a good example. We've done alcohol education in schools. We've done physical education. We, we keep trying to use schools as a way to solve public health problems. And the fact is you can't solve public health problems without public health approaches. That if we actually want kids to get moving, we need to just make it easier for them to do that, right. Again, we need to close streets and give them a place to play. We need to make it safe for them to walk and bike to school. We need to build playgrounds and parks near them so they can use them. We need to give parents decent working schedules so they can go on walks with their kids and throw frisbees around. It's these things that will actually encourage the outcomes that we want rather than just fucking raising awareness of like exercise is good and fatness is bad, right?  Aubrey:   We also don't need to tell people that smoking is bad at this point. If you are smoking at this point, it is for other reasons than not knowing, like you don't need to worry that fat people don't know that it's like bad to be fat or that it's seen as bad to be fat. Like you don't need to worry about that. That box is checked, team.  Mike:   So the closest thing to a happy ending that we're going to get is it appears a lot of states are actually starting to finally get rid of these absurd laws requiring fitness tests. So California is at the Vanguard of this. There's a big debate in California right now about whether to get rid of this requirement. And interestingly it is being led by the parents of nonbinary kids.  Aubrey:   Oh sure.  Mike:   Because these male/female totally different, you know, binary requirements, the trans kids, nonbinary, intersex kids, and their parents are like, “Well, this is really alienating to me and fuck you.” So I hope that like this results in a broader movement to just get ready of these tests altogether.  Aubrey:   Seriously.  Mike:   So yeah, that's the end of my, um, long torturous depressing journey through the president's physical test. It's worse than you thought.  Aubrey:   It's so much worse than I thought. but I also have to say, I feel oddly at peace and validated that it wasn't just a shit show for me and for the fat kids that I knew and the disabled kids that I know. But that it is just a garbage fire of public policy.  Mike:   Yes.  Aubrey:   From like every angle it's like pretty indefensible at this point.  Mike:   Yes. There was no evidence to do it in the first place. The evidence that it works is non-existent and the evidence that getting rid of it is good is there, so just on every level, like, yes, let's do this.  Aubrey:   Listen aside from fat kids disabled, it's like, aside from everyone, who's on the downside of this really terrible activity, what’s the problem? Jocks really seem to like their trophies.  Mike:   That one girl who looked like Marilyn Manson, she loves it. We’re doing it for her.\""

And here we have a dad who, you know is interested like, you know, why do you cry? And he wants to become more human. And he's kind of becoming more the image of his son.

Not only to have a dad that will beat the shit out of two punks who very nicely just come over to try to help you out.  Totally my dad can beat up your dad. Yes.

Watching like Terminator 3, for example, which I also did this week and it's just on every level, a worst version of Terminator 2 while doing nothing remotely new. A lot of times, and this happens in horror movies too, that you're like, why is this character walking up the stairs when there's blood pouring down it, like, why is this character doing this completely absurd thing? And because you, you're not really convinced of why anything on screen is happening at this fundamental level, it sort of pulls you away from it. You're like, well, all these people are being stupid. Like I'm not going to be invested in this, but in every James Cameron movie, like Rose, for Rose to jump from the lifeboat back onto the Titanic makes no sense, but we've spent so much time with that character at that point, we've gotten to know her, we know her personality, that it's like, yes, she would absolutely do this. We are with her when she makes this completely idiotic decision.  Alex:   The Rose I know, would do this.  Yes, the Rose I know. And also John Connor going and rescuing his mother from the mental institution makes no sense. Like it's, the Terminator tells him, like, we're probably going to die if we do this. And he's like, Nope, we have to do this. And we're with it because we know enough about this character, James Cameron has given us enough information that we are with John Connor when he does that, we are with like, we, we get emotionally why he has to go do this completely stupid thing. And we get why. Sarah Connor wants to go kill miles Dyson, which also is a very high risk and very stupid thing to do. But we know these characters enough and you're like, yep. Like that is what Sarah Connor would do. This is, this is the defining thing of her life.  Alex:   And by this time that the first, the first go, when the Terminator's like, we shouldn't go save your mother basically, this is messy. This is a bad idea, but they go anyway, and they do it. And by the time that he realizes that Sarah Connor is going to go and kill Miles Dyson, he has grown to understand humans enough to be like, this is, might be a good idea. And I love that so much. Sarah, why, why does that stick out for you?\",\n",

But every single action sequence in this movie, they are outmatched. He's on a little tiny motorbike and there's a giant semi. They can go faster than him that's chasing him. They are up against this liquid metal creature that is totally impervious to everything. At every point like they could really die. And I remember I forget who I'm stealing this from, but I remember somebody talking about how, you know, movies, like   Man of Steel   or these other like Marvel movies were just like a bunch of strong people hitting each other. It's not clear to you sort of, well, does that hurt or are they like damaged by this? Or like, you have nothing to really connect to. Whereas if you're watching a movie and a character slammed their hand in a car door, you're going to involuntarily be like, ah, cause that's something that you can relate to. And that to me is like the difference between action and suspense, that in suspense, you can see yourself, you can put yourself on that motorbike and you're like, there's a pretty good chance I'm going to fucking die. This guy, this guy is going faster than me. This guy is smarter than me. He's more powerful than me. And like in every action sequence in this movie, the bad guys could win. That to me is why this works so well.  Alex:   There's clear stakes. And they illustrate the stakes very well too, in that like when Sarah gets stabbed, we see her get sewn up, which I think is really an interesting choice because usually like in a fight, someone in a, in a modern action movie takes the damage that would liquefy your skull and has like a black eye and in this these people bleed and they have to be sewn up and it's, it's, it's messy.\",\n",

And I just think of Linda Hamilton on that set, like probably freezing cold with 2% body fat and having to maintain this absurd body of hers for the entire time that they were filming. And like, it's her husband kind of making her do all this. I mean, there is something about like, James Cameron being like the difficult genius. Who's also just a complete fucking asshole, it sounds like. I mean, consistent stories from people that have worked for him, of him doing just atrocious behavior on set. And so we all, we all repeat like the worst attributes of our parents. And so not to like cancel James Cameron or anything, but that's always like, in the back of my head, when I watched this movie, the way that they filmed this, is just like her suffering and James Cameron being just like a total dick.

       " 'Sarah': [\"Hello, Alex Steed.  Alex:   What are we going to talk about today?  We're going to talk about Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  Alex:   What is Why Are Dads? about?   Why Are Dads? is about trying to understand our relationships with our dads and our culture's relationship with what dads are, by watching lots of movies and talking to our friends.  Alex:   Is there anything special by way of guests in this episode?  There is. We have my You’re Wrong About co-host Michael Hobbes guesting on this episode. It's really cool.  Alex:   Why did Terminator 2 come up as what we should talk about with Michael Hobbes?  Well it was his suggestion, but it's a movie that we all independently love, and I think have a strong, emotional connection to.  Alex:   Do you think people know that they have strong, emotional connections to Terminator 2, or that they just love it?  I think people in America have an amazingly hard time knowing what is and is not an emotion. So I don’t know. But to me it's a highly emotional movie. It's like   Land Before Time  , in terms of like having this lovely, steady, parental figure who then has to be killed by lava and about just losing it and, you know, crying like the little boy that you are, who's losing your robot daddy you only had for a few days. Like, I don't know. I think that there are a lot of movies that do things that the people who love them never mentioned as a reason why they love them, but at least can't conflict with their love of it too much. And to me, another example of this is   Scarface  , which is a movie about being murdered in your own home, inevitably, just about the death drive of capitalist masculinity.  Alex:   A lot of people might love Terminator 2 and they might think that it's a great action movie. Like an elevated great action movie.  Which it is, it's a great action movie.  Alex:   With no doubt, but I think they might also have no idea that the reason it is great is it makes them feel feelings.  Oh yeah. I'm sure. And a lot of movies, if you ask, what's the most memorable part, you’re like, it's the part with the chase with the motorcycle and the scooter and the semi, which is like what you think of in terms of images, but it's action on your heart too.  Alex:   And not that James Cameron made me feel dad feelings while he was addressing his own dad issues.  Right? Yeah. And I think that is what makes James Cameron, James Cameron. That he has this wonderful technical obsession and ability. And that as far as, you know, Titanic, his master work was concerned. Part of the appeal for him was getting to reconstruct the Titanic and then sink it and see what it had looked like and just be this engineer making a movie, but that he also was like, and it's about love. You know, he just has that ability to connect our love of the technical, the dad viewer’s love of the technical and of vehicles with just very easy to understand and connect with stories about powerful love between people.  Alex:   Mm, you know, we talk about how overt some of the themes are in the movie, because they were explained to us by their protagonist in voiceovers. Even as unsettled as it is, it's still so beautifully packaged and so beautifully wrapped. And there's such a nice series of bows on it that a lot of folks might have no idea that it's there. Like my dad would have watched this movie and had no idea that it was there.  But it would have gone in like when you have to give your dog medication.  Alex:   Exactly just smear it and peanut butter. We should remind people that we have a Patreon and there are bonus episodes. And this week there'll be a bonus episode with you and I Sarah, talking about things and answering questions from people who listen to the show and there'll be some odds and ends that didn't quite make it into this episode because, uh, there were a lot of asides  I like asides. You know, it's, it's like, I'm like Sally in   When Harry met Sally  , you know, I just want everything on the side.  Alex:   All right. Let's watch Terminator 2.  “Watching John with the machine. It was suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop. It would never leave him. And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there, and it would die to protect him. Of all the would be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine was the only one who measured up in an insane world. It was the sanest choice.”  Welcome to my two dads.\",\n",
       "  \"Also a lot of people who Alex are convinced that I'm the one who tweets from the Why Are Dad's account and you tweet quite a few times, I've been like, no, it's me, Alex. And then the bio it's like Alex is tweeting and all these people are like, “Sarah's having a conversation with herself”. And I'm like, I'm not. That I feel like people really like picturing that, and that's fine too.  Alex:   And the My Two Dads thing. Am I Paul Reiser or is it Michael?  I don't remember the other dad. Who's the other dad?  Alex:   He had the curly hair and really bad facial hair but was super fun. And he had a tiny earring.  I have no idea. I just remember Paul Reiser. Mike, did you ever watch this show?\",\n",

And I was like, is Warren Beatty my dad?  Alex:   Do you remember that show Sarah how the judge was basically Fran Leibowitz.  No, was it like a feminist statement making judge?  Alex:   No, it was like a judge, a character actress who just reminds of Fran Leibowitz.  Huh. That's great.  Alex:   Yeah. You should revisit that show.  Yes, we should all watch it next time. But the point is that I do think that that comparison is in some way true because you were two of the most consistently affirming presences in my life. Each of you, individually, which we have determined is one of the qualities of a good dad. Which is what we're going to discuss in the capacity of Terminator 2. Oh! Brought it around.

So this is the first time I've come back to it since then, which is really nice because it's still quite fresh. Yeah. I had forgotten how explicitly dad centric this movie is to the point where there's literally a voiceover where Sarah Connor is like, as I watched my son playing with this robot, that was a reprogram version of the robot that had tried to murder me while I was pregnant and had indeed killed his own human father. I was like, well, he's the best dad that my son is ever going to have. So this is good.  Alex:   Every time someone suggests we watched that movie, they quote exactly that line. So it does the work.\",\n",
       "  \"I think that James Cameron is great at being unsubtle and that that's a different thing from being bad at subtle because he doesn't think he's subtle.  Alex:   That's true. Bad at subtle and unsubtle are two different things.\",\n",
       "  \"Women tell us themes. That's one of their jobs in a movie.  Alex:   Which I think is great when I think about what we're doing with the show, which is talking about like complicated dad stuff by using popular movies people like.\",\n",
       "  \"Yeah, wouldn’t it be wonderful if you could buy the Linda Hamilton voiceover pack, like on Cameo. Which maybe she would be down for who knows. And you could get her to like watch   Cabin in the Woods   and then get her to do voiceover about the themes. So I guess like middle of Cabin in the Woods, she's like, this is the theme of this movie.\",\n",

I didn't think this now, but I remember as a kid thinking he was annoying and being worried other people would find him annoying and thus find me annoying.  Nooo! Alex oh no! Okay. You know what I think about John Connor? John Connor in this movie played by Edward Furlong looks exactly like Judith Butler and also kind of behaves like Judith Butler.  Alex:   Everyone is androgynous in this movie. I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not androgynous, but like everyone, everyone's gender is kind of androgynous when packaged.  But Arnold Schwarzenegger is a robot. So he has a different relationship to gender fundamentally. I was wondering as he walked into this biker bar in the opening, actually, does the Terminator have a penis?\",\n",

       "  \"Yes. That could be a whole other spinoff, but yeah. I mean, John Connor bonds with this robot and immediately starts teaching him to be more human and is like, well, I love you. You're my, you're my father figure. And it's clear that like Sarah’s awkward voiceover is in recognition of that emotional reality, which I think is one of the things that makes it like fun, like ultimately emotionally non-awkward for me. And so, you know, John Connor is like, well, the thing that is my dad is determined by if it behaves in a dad-ly way to me and not so much on whether it's human.\",\n",

I wanted to talk about action, and I wanted to talk about gore as like things in movies that are maligned as just like stupid and pointless, but which I think can be good, can be well executed or poorly executed. And I feel like the action scenes in this movie appeal to a part of me that I think is like a sincere and lovely part of humans that just like feels joy at the concept of like, oh my goodness, that semi is going to leap into that aqueduct. Like, I've never seen that before. Like I want to see that! I do! Like, what will happen? What is it like?\",\n",

Alex:   So this is another tidbit from my childhood relationship with this movie is this was one of the few, I think one of the few action movies or popular movies that came out that didn't have a licensed soundtrack. That didn't have a soundtrack that was like Guns and Roses, like whatever else in there. And it only has four popular songs, two of which are Dwight Yoakum songs.\",\n",

It's a good music cue song because it, like Linda Hamilton, it's like, here's the theme of this scene.\",\n",

       "  'I just would love to talk for a second about whether you think about James Cameron, when you watch this, or sort of the themes of his movies in this, because this is the movie that he made after   Aliens  . Aliens is a fun ensemble movie where everybody dies. Is that a fair description?',\n",
       "  \"And motherhood. Yeah. There's a ton of motherhood in there and I feel like I'm interested in James Cameron as a director who has some themes. And one of them also is that love will save you. And so, Mike, I was reflecting actually this morning that like the last significant thing I published before you and I started working together was a piece on Titanic. We've talked about James Cameron making Titanic.\",\n",
       "  \"Thank you. And to me, this interesting concept of him having made this movie Titanic, which is clearly an action movie and is also a lot of other kinds of movies, but as remembered as like a tween movie, but clearly it was a movie that like everybody saw because it was the number one movie in America for four months. Like you do not get there based on tweens, like tweens do not have that kind of money. Like how much do you think babysitting pays? It is not enough. I feel like Terminator 2 isn't maligned the way Titanic is because Titanic is some of James Cameron's finest work as a director and as a director of like action sequences and like stuff blowing up and falling apart, people dying in intense ways, all of which were hallmarks of his other films. But like, unfortunately, men don't sit around watching Titanic, for some reason. You are men. And a lot of people who would legitimately like it think that they wouldn't like it because it's been maligned. But also there is the fact that it's like, it's very focused on a love plot and it's also really, really death-y. Like there's like hundreds of deaths and you really linger on it and you remember them. But I feel like this movie is, I can feel the structure of Titanic kind of emerging from this and being rearranged from this because it is like a very long, and yet somehow captivating sequence of events where like people's bonds with each other drive a lot of action. And I think that that's what James Cameron is really good at.  Alex:   With regard to Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, Titanic for sure. I did not care about or see   Avatar  .  Interestingly, I have not seen Avatar and I have no interest in seeing Avatar. It just seems like I, whatever.  Alex:   Strength is exhausting and, and, and the abyss is a little clunky in this arena, but James Cameron is exceptionally good at making you care about the people who drive the action, which I don't think people are very good at generally in action movies.  It's hard.\",\n",
       "  'I think because it happens relatively rarely. And I think that, I feel like people know horror by bad horror tropes and they also know action by bad action tropes and just the trope of like the unnecessary car chase or like the car chase cobbled together out of cliches. And, you know, I really love the like moped motorcycle, semi chase in this movie a lot.',\n",
       "  \"Um, right. And like, and what's, what is it? That's great about that scene because we've all seen like 800 chase scenes in our lives. And like, most of them you forget immediately and you kind of enjoy them at the time cause there's something exciting happening. But then if someone asked you what happened a day later, you'd be like, ah, why is this memorable?  Alex:   I think to me about why that's so interesting is that the, the body of what is happening represents the people so well, right? So you have this kid on a moped, you have a child, you can identify with sort of one of the three people that are involved. You have a child. And that was me. And I was like, if I were on a moped, I'd be scared shitless. You have the brute force of T 1000 driving, driving the semi and not giving a fuck at all and destroying everything in his way. And then you have your cool daddy. Who's wearing a leather jacket and operating a shotgun with one hand to protect you, who comes in sort of out maneuvers the situation and saves you. Like in the French connection, which is great and sets the standards for these kinds of races, it's an equal match between two people. Right? But like the idea that you have these three personalities manifesting in this chase is glorious.  Yeah.\",\n",
       "  \"And you just know they didn't have any local anesthesia on them at the time.  Alex:   So Sarah, we talked about this setup of why this is a dad movie down to Sarah Connor's narration explaining. She basically says like this thing will be loyal till the end fight for the kid, listen to the kid and not hit the kid.  And not get drunk.  Alex:   It's a dad movie for sure. But as a result, it's definitely very much a mom movie. I mean, it's, it's Sarah Connor and the kid, and it has this interesting thing that happens that John has to go through at 10 or 11 or whatever that I went through at like 32, which is realizing your mom was right.  Hmm. Oh yeah.  Alex:   He's written off his mom and says that she's, it's crazy and she's shitty and bat shit or whatever, for all the things that she believes. And then essentially says out loud to Arnold, he says that it's fucking with him, that he can't believe that this all is a real thing. And that his mom was right. That's such an interesting reveal cause this poor you know, this poor woman lives absolutely alone in not a delusion, but in her take on what's going to happen to the world, her clarity, you know, she's vindicated in a way that's not super fun. Cause she has to go through all this action and trauma again. I feel like there's not a lot of movies in which like mom gets validated.  Well that and also I was watching this and it was the part where there, you know, in the final sequence, invading the factory with the chips and everything. I don't know if it's a factory.\",\n",
       "  \"Before that, when they go to the, to get the, like the parts and then they go to the steel mill, that's like next door or whatever. So when they beginning this final action sequence, I was just noticing, you know, that John Connor is like, you know, come on mom, blah, blah, blah, mom. And I was like, wow, there's really a dearth of movies with mother and child action sequences, isn't there. Not that there's a lot of parent and child action sequences either, but I was like, this is great. I would like to see more of this. And like Aliens is like working towards that because we have Ripley and this little girl, Newt, who she sort of becomes a surrogate parent figure for the period of this movie, but like they don't have a preexisting relationship. And just this concept of actually exploring parenthood in an action movie, I think is really, you know, I mean that, I love that. And I also love that they have, they have this vehicular chasing and then pretty soon after follow it with Sarah Connor trying to escape from the mental institution where he has been basically incarcerated. And it's like Sarah on foot versus all of these security guards. And she is outgunned as her son has just been. And so, and I love that, you know, the movie bothers to be like, this is exciting too. You're excited. Watch this you're excited about this woman. She is a character, and we are not forgetting about her.\",\n",
       "  \"Yeah. So then that's why he cries. And that's why the Terminator first sees him crying.  Mike;   That's why he speaks through his bangs for the first half of the movie.  Alex:   Oh, my God, the fucking bangs in this movie. On that theme can we talk about James Cameron and androgynous masculine women?  Yes. And androgynous beautiful youths also with that haircut, Jack Dawson.  Alex:   Yeah. So, Oh, absolutely. With that specific haircut. Yeah. John Connor is his pregame Jack Dawson.  This is why every child's watching Terminator 2 can identify with John Connor. I hope.  Alex:   Until someone pointed it out on Twitter, I didn't realize that the foster mother in this movie is Vasquez from Aliens.\",\n",
       "  \"Who I think has a bra company now and she's in Titanic. And who is she?  Alex:   Irish Mother!  Irish mother. She was a better mom in that, than in this.  Alex:   Everything pre avatar. There is a androgynous strong potential lead quasi daddy, mom.  That's why I don't want to see Avatar. Where's that for me?  Alex:   Isn't the lead also like a nine foot lady?  I mean, I don't know. It's, there's some guy who's a space Marine and there's a bunch of digitized, they're not Native Americans, but they are clearly, and I don't know.  Alex:   If you have a lot to say about avatar listeners, make sure to @ all of us all the time.\",\n",
       "  \"I would like someone to hard sell me on Avatar or there are people out there who are passionate about Avatar and they can tell me how they feel about it. But yes, no, that's a consistent theme. And like, and you know, I feel like we can see Terminator as his first movie and like his also the James Cameron heroine in original form. Cause we start off with Sarah Connor as this just like avid average waitress struggling through. And, you know, he, he also loves as a director to like show us a character who starts off knowing basically nothing but is a fast learner and can be resourceful and figure things out, which I love. I love to see that.  Alex:   All of his movies are about some progression of becoming butch.  That's true.  Alex:   With the Sarah Connor one and from the first one in particular with Rose, the lead in the abyss, it kind of is always a bit of a hard-ass.\",\n",
       "  \"Trauma gives you great muscles.  Alex:   I mean, I don't know what he intends, but there's so much imagery in Terminator 2 of this woman seeing her past feminine self, getting burned to death, like literally burned to death. And so the only way that she can survive the way the world is, and the way humans are to each other. And this whole movie is a comment on how humans just can't fucking get their shit together and be cool to each other. The only way she can survive is to be what she has become. And even that's not great. Like even that's messy.\",\n",

       "  \"I don't think they would let a skinny, angry cop in though.  Alex:   And his mother, right? Like, it's like a, three-way, it's a three-way fight for this kid's affection.  I also love that like the T1000, maybe this is strategic. Probably it is, but I love that he chooses to merge initially with a cop and now he can move freely around society. Just like having car chases and killing people.  Alex:   He becomes LAPD, which wasn't commentary on anything.  Not at 1991.  Alex:   That's like machines, machines will kill you and they'll do it by dressing up like a cop.  If only Sarah Connor had mentioned that theme. She used to be like, as I watched the T 1000, I reflected on police brutality because for those of you in the back row who can't, you know, hear the dialogue over the Twizzlers.  Alex:   It's the reason, obviously also why all of us are terrified of that company that releases cute killer robot dog videos all the time.\",\n",

And he's programmed to care about your needs, which is like interesting to note that that is what distinguishes him from his flesh counterparts.  Alex:   The fact that he's an engineer puts into context the line or the exchange that John and Arnold have about what T 1000 can and can't do. And one of the things T 1000 can't do is replicate complicated machinery.\",\n",

And he can get one of his hooks into the car and then he gets thrown off, but we get to see him fall and roll over his hooks a few times and they make the cutest little sound.

It's like, you all are fucking around with technology in a way that's going to be real bad because you're doing it in a thoughtless way. And it's going to land us in a nuclear Holocaust. Also, uh, maybe be cooler to each other. Like these are the two things that are occurring.  Be excellent to each other and listen to your son or else he'll love a robot more than he could ever love any human. And that's not great. I mean, the other thing that I love about James Cameron's vision of masculinity and I mean, love in a complicated way. Like, I, I, I feel. I just feel like James Cameron, who has been married like five times, is expressing something interesting in the fact that Sarah Connor is watching her son and the Terminator, and she's like, he'll always protect him, and he'll die for him. And then in Titanic, you know, the major plot hole that people are annoyed by with Titanic is like did Jack have to die though? Like, that was a pretty big fucking piece of wood though. Wasn't it? And like, I think they myth busted it and they were like, yeah, if they both got there. If they put some life vests under it, which were very available because of all the corpses floating around, they could have totally, both been on it. So, and what I think people don't get is that that's not a science thing. It's a screenwriting thing because James Cameron cannot imagine a heteronormative relationship that doesn't end in trauma for everybody. And that he, I think he feels like Jack Dawson is this beautiful, heroic being of pure love because he is like, you know, the Terminator in Judgment Day because he appears in this troubled teen life and is like, “I'm here to love you and die for you to save you”. And, you know, and a boy and his robot I guess, were to believe that they couldn't have a long-term future together, or, you know, he has to die because he has to destroy his robot chip that would give the technology to the people who would use it to bring about an apocalyptic future. So like that's better expressed through screenwriting than in Titanic. Um, but, but I just feel like in those storytelling choices, there's this basic idea of like, but these relationships are impossible in the long-term, obviously. You just have like four action packed days and then die for someone. And that's love.\",\n",
       "  'And the only way for them to be uncomplicated is to die.',\n",
       "  'I did not know this about you. I think it could happen in Wisconsin.',\n",
       "  'I think this is what   Joe Exotic   thought, right?',\n",
       "  \"Oh my God, do I wish my dad was the Terminator. That would be incredible. Like today, right now, I could be like, “Dad, did you listen to my show that I put off this week?” He'd be like, “Yes, I enjoyed minute 47”.\",\n",
       "  'This was also your argument against the   Stepford Wives   scenario, which is that ultimately these men are going to wither from like lack of emotional connection with these bots.',\n",
       "  'Also, Mick Jagger says that.',\n",
       "  \"Well, we need unconditional love and then also to have boundaries and for someone to have a personality, but I think unconditional love plus personality is an attainable human thing. Yeah. I also feel like, it seems like the Terminator is like a Furby though. Maybe over time he could develop a personality, not the Furbies ever did that because it was all lies. But we were told that that would happen.  Alex:   We develop our personalities in part, by obviously our chemical makeup, all of the things in our opportunism, right? Like how are we going to get from point a to point B? And if the Terminator’s only goal is to keep John alive, like does his personality just entirely formed to serve that purpose? That's exciting. I want to see that movie.\",\n",
       "  \"I feel like this also speaks to the issues with sustainability in Titanic, because like, I think another reason I love Jack Dawson is that he's like the highly rare and prized manic, pixie dream guy. Cause he basically like all of his attributes are like designed in a lab to be able to like sexually awaken and emotionally liberate this protagonist character that we have.  So like, he is like an advanced Terminator made for Rose DeWitt Bukater. So like, you can also see why in the long term, like he needs to develop a personality of his own. Like that's the same problem Zoe Deschanel has in   500 Days of Summer  .  Alex:   With Cameron's own personal inability to maintain a relationship for more than whatever, three or four years, we are seeing that across the board in these movies. And we're seeing that because he has an unhealthy, probably an unhealthy relationship with sustainability and long-term relationships. That's also like a positive thing.  Although he is doing well now he got married with the lady he cheated on his girlfriend with when he was making Titanic and they've been married for like 23 years. So hooray. Right.\",\n",
       "  \"And that woman he cheated on was Linda Hamilton. Anyway.  Alex:   It's a good recognition that just like some relationships last for as long as you need them to in the way that they're supposed to. Right? Like you grow in the ways that you grow and then it's over and your dad has to throw himself into molten metal.  Ideally.\",\n",
       "  \"No, Mike, it's going to happen in my next relationship, actually.\",\n",
       "  \"But it’s so overdetermined that they can't express that in five minutes. So they just have to have them stare at each other because they both have this like cosmic realization that they are MFEO. And like the movie doesn't trust itself to show them actually clicking in a way that's significant enough to justify everything that's just happened. Sleepless in Seattle, like the relationship that is actually depicted in that movie is between Meg, Ryan and Rosie O'Donnell and between Tom Hanks and his son. And those are lovely relationships. Like it's a lovely father son and like friend relationship and like, Oh no, I'm engaged to the wrong person. I have doubts, movie. But like the central love plot is like a maypole that those are like wound around as an excuse to be there.\",\n",
       "  \"That sounds like something you would watch on a plane.  Alex:   but Jason Matsoukis and Andrea Savage are in it and they are not primary characters, but they play an older married couple. I mean, they've been married for like 10 years and their chemistry is, it's like a turn-on. You're like, I didn't know this was possible. Well, I do, now that I'm married to someone, I feel that way. But like, or you're like, I didn't know that this could be possible on screen. It's really magical when it happens.  That's how I feel about Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep in Julie and Julia.\",\n",
       "  \"Right? That is like a pretty weak movie structurally, but there are just these parts where you're like, let's watch. . First of all, Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep, just eating each other alive. You know what I mean? The lunch break sex in that movie. And they're both in their fifties. I think at this point, Stanley Tucci was around 50, I think Meryl Streep is around 60.  Alex:   I think they’re naturally super horny people too. They just exude horniness, which is great.  They certainly do. And they are certainly expressing that in this movie. Honestly, I think what happened in that movie is that Amy Adams kind of got short shrift because she got all the crappy parts of marriage to play and they were like, here's your story. You get to be disappointment and getting tired of each other. And this is an excuse to have all the conflict crammed into your parts, so that Meryl Streep and Stanley two kicking guess, fuck each other and eat cakes.\",\n",
       "  'Bye everybody. Say, bye.',\n",
       "  \"How many times did you shout that? I'm going to guess 41.\",\n",
       "  'And that his life is saved initially by the fact that he liked ducks. Like he has, what is happening. His son is on his little trike or something.',\n",
       "  'And he ducks.  Alex:   He gets hit or something and goes down.  First of all, we kill a lot of cops in this movie. Second of all.',\n",
       "  \"All right.  Mike;   That's the real, that's the real Terminator three. It should have just been one of these cops going through years of physical therapy.  Alex:   We haven't talked at all about Miles Dyson and miles Dyson throws away-  With very little convincing, honestly.  Alex:   With little convincing he's like, I'll throw away my life's work and do the right thing and the most refreshing way to do it.  Well, if I were him, I would be like, how am I to know that a rival company didn't just hire an amputee to pretend to be from the future. Like that's honestly what my first thought would be.  Alex:   Absolutely doable to fake what happened.  I mean, if they can make that movie, then they could probably do that, so.  Alex:   And like this mean lady is trying to kill me, but then like her son is here and she's nice to him for the first time.  How do I know these aren't just a bunch of racists with a robot arm.  Alex:   The one very nice, and this is, this is clearly like a foster child thing, like from John's experience being a foster child. But when Arnold does the thing where he opens his arm up and shows and shows Miles. John takes the little point and says, will you show me your room? I loved that so much. Ah, it's such a nice little detail. Okay. So Sarah Connor's thesis about the Terminator is this'll be a good dad because it's not as CIS human man. Is that the thesis of the movie, about dads with the exception of Miles Dyson, who can be good.  It's nice that he's able to do masculine things with my son, but the fact that he's not bringing my son into the culture of patriarchal masculinity as it is that he just like is a man who listens and has car chases.\",\n",
       "  \"No exactly. It’s masculine but like without, cause to me, there's like the masculinity of fixing a car and then there's like the patriarchal toxic, like impacted over generations, masculinity that my dad has of like, I'm not going to tell you how to notice a problem and fix it. I'm going to demean you for 45 minutes and prove that I'm bigger and smarter than you and this car is an excuse which is why I don't know a thing about cars and why they stress me out. And he does that because he had a dad who raised him as a male child and nothing good came of it the entire time.  Alex:   And passed the curse on like that thing that comes out of Jason and Jason goes to hell.  It's like drag me to hell. It's just a slime bar from mouth to mouth between generations.  Alex:   Patriarchy.\",\n",

Could he like turn them into little bullets, you know, for like shooting down those ducks?',\n",

I think I want to marry someone like that. Yeah. I think this relates to just like my attraction to people who I think in a way that is similar to me, and this involves me embracing who I am, are like very intelligent and attuned in some ways. And like fundamentally clueless about other things in a way that's also nice because like, if you just don't care about a lot of areas of human life then, like you don't put pressure on people, you're in a relationship with about it, perhaps for no reason. So yeah. I want to marry the Terminator.\",\n",
       "  \"No, because you can ask him to be emotionally present and then he will do that. I mean, I don't actually want a robot from the future because I think that that would be setting myself up for failure. He's a character who is fundamentally tragic because he is a robot.\",\n",
       "  \"And is therefore freed of the kind of, I dunno, I feel like I see James Cameron imagining, like what would allow him to be the kind of protagonist that he wishes him to be, type of a thing. And I think that's one of the things that makes Jack Dawson so compelling. And with this one, he's like a character who has no pride, no self-regard, like no ego, really. You need to have some ego, but like who basically is able to be fully in a relationship and like that's- and to live fully for another person. And I think that's what makes it unsustainable along with the future war aspect of it. But also, you know, this is, I think like I would imagine that this might be James Cameron's fantasy of like being 100% for the other person in a relationship when really he would like to be like 51% as opposed to whatever percentage she has managed to be on this marriage.  Alex;   Yeah. The Terminator, he fills the fluids in your car, but he doesn't give you a hard time about not doing it.\",\n",

That's my relationship with this man. And I was like, Oh, that really changes your attraction.  That was all I could think about when he was running for governor. And I remember someone pointed this out online and it became like the defining thing is that like he's, he was naked. He was fully naked in a very lingered on and wonderful way in the start of the Terminator. And then he's naked again in this. And like, I think a less sort of cinematic way, but it's just nice that he's naked again. And I imagine when this came out in the theater that everyone was like, “Whoo!” You know, cause like here he is, he's naked again. This is how he time travels. He’s got to be naked. Yeah. And when he was running for governor, I remember there was actually a thing on rotten.com where they had a picture of him taken by Robert Mapplethorpe. That was just like fully nude. This is the governor of California. And I was like, well, this is a new experience for all of us as Americans and we're not, and you know, once you cross the governor dick-line, you don't come back. And honestly, like, it's definitely weird, but it's also, I think, way more positive to have a governor who has, like, I don't think he did a good job as governor, but in theory, it's a better job to have a governor who has just, like publicly had their Dick photographed by an arty photographer than someone who's gonna do all sorts of weird covert stuff with it, for lack of having it photographed in the 70s.\",\n",

But my impression of him from pumping iron, which I find honestly meaningful to me in my own pursuit of putting together like a life that I wanted to have. He is someone who found a career that he was perfectly suited for. And excelled, partly because of his self-knowledge, you know, and just like his absolute joy in being, just in bodybuilding and like going out and winning and like greasing himself up and posing when you pose, like you got to hear that accent of his, which is wonderful. And, uh, and I love Conan the barbarian. Yeah. Just his utter joy, at just the act of like lifting heavy things and like changing the shape of his body in different places is just like, I'm very bonded with him as he was in pumping iron.

Like Christian Bale loves doing this. And like Vincent D'Onofrio gained like 70 pounds for   Full Metal Jacket   and stuff like that.

I love the story of how James Cameron made Terminator 1, ultimately after years of like working on Roger Corman films and like during lunch breaks, when he was building alien spaceship sets out of McDonald's boxes, he would tell his fellow workers, including Bill Paxton, the story idea he had about this robot from the future who tries to kill a pregnant woman. Um, so like that whole evolution is wonderful, but you can also, yeah, you can come into Judgment Day having seen nothing before and enjoy it a ton. And I think you could, I would recommend watching it if you want to actually feel a lot of adrenaline and like some fun action sequences and be taken out of the present moment and then end on a note that gives you a sense of convincing hope for humanity.
