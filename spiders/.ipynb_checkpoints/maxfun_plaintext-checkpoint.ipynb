Two percent of the population has vanished and Nora lives in Mapleton, New York. Not the Midwest! She’s the only person in town who’s kind of lost her entire immediate family. When you started to explore the character of Nora, she was—in the pilot, she’s not—she doesn’t seem as central as she becomes later.

And so, it just became a bigger part of the piece. And I didn’t expect it to continue to grow to the point where I would get to finish it out in that spectacular fashion. So, I was really flattered, of course. Because I didn’t work that much those first four episodes! And then episode six came and that was the first time in my life I’d ever been basically in every frame of something for—you know—a whole shoot. I’d really only done a scene here and there up until that point. And so, there was a lot of pressure ',\n",

Like, you can kind of imagine it being a pretty—a pretty real idea of what the world might look like if this very, very kind of fantastical event happened. But as it goes on, it kind of gets more and more surreal and strange and, to me, kind of cool and interesting. Does it change the performance at all, as the show gets kind of more bent? Does it call on any different skills or is it all just Nora is now in a different kind of situation?',\n",

He wrote that book shortly after 9/11. And so, the first season’s grounded in the book in a way that the rest of the seasons just aren’t. There’s a—there is a lot more humor and it kind of loosens up a little bit. I mean, Tom’s books are very funny, but that’s not what our season one was really like. And so, I always say, when you—when you come back to shoot a season, it feels like putting on a wet bathing suit. Like, I know this is my bathing suit, but it’s really uncomfortable. ',\n",

It was really liberating. And I have to say, Nora Durst did feel like a character who was capable of anything. And so, nothing ever felt uncomfortable to do or out of—or something that she wouldn’t attempt or didn’t feel out of line for her. And it was such a joy as an actor, because it did call on so many parts of me and so often women’s roles in particular, I think, are very narrow in their scope of expression. And so, for me to have Nora Durst be at once, you know, dark and sad but also filled with rage but also funny but also very physical—it was—it was such a challenge and it was so much fun to be—to be pushed in that way and to be asked to do those things. And so, it was really just a fun ride. You know. It’s as fun a ride as it is to watch. And of course, you know, unfortunately it’s feeling more grounded and realistic than ever. ',\n",

There’s a lot of just economic hardship right now among actors and people who work in all facets of the business and most of the theater companies are not gonna survive, because we live in a country that doesn’t support the arts. So, we rely so much on ticket sales and grants and—you know, the Trump administration, every year they were in charge, tried to diminish the funds for the museums, for the—you know—operas and for public broadcasting and, you know, there have been a few republicans who have managed to keep them from entirely eliminating that funding, but that’s changing now too. So, I’m really afraid for my theater community. And right now, you know, people keep asking me sort of, “What do you envision is next?” It’s like, there’s—right now there’s no next. There’s too much pain. And, in addition to that, we have these institutional conversations happening about what are the ways that, as liberal organizations, we have failed in the Black Lives Matter movement and—you know, just sort of bringing forward the voices we have a responsibility to make space for. There’s room for everybody. But we—you know, it shouldn’t be—this shouldn’t be a—these resources are not finite. You know. Art is not finite. Love is not finite. There’s space. But institutions haven’t necessarily made that—made those choices very consciously. So, you know, there’s a—there’s a bigger struggle going on if we even do get to come back. And of course, I also say, the way arts function, they’re a necessary component of any society and they are ultimately gonna tell the history of this moment. And that means that new companies will start, and younger and more vital voices will start to emerge and there probably had to be a big shift like this. And so, something amazing will come out of it. I’m just not the person to say what it’s gonna look like or what it will be. But right now, it’s just a lot of, like, very real pain and very real… just material lack for people who can’t work. And a lot of my friends are—you know, they’re gonna be forced out of the business. You know, in Europe, every small town has a theater that’s subsidized by the government. And they grow up seeing Chekov and Shakespeare and Shaw and you know, they—the actors that work in Europe are on a salary. And that’s all they do. And they don’t have to do eight shows a week. They work in rep and so they get to be artists. And in America, there’s a sort of shame around saying, “I’m an artist.” We have to say, “I’m an artist, but I also—I’m also working on this or that or this podcast. Or I have this other thing going.” We’re not allowed to claim it. There’s a real—I don’t know. The attitude toward the arts is getting more and more dire. ',\n",

I think what he does is really astonishing. And he’s very willing to take a chance on a lesser-known actor if he thinks they’re right for the part.

[Music fades out.] music “Huddle Formation” from the album  Thunder, Lightning, Strike  by The Go! Team. jesse thorn It’s  Bullseye . I’m Jesse Thorn. Carrie Coon, the actor, is said to exude a Midwestern pragmatism. At least, that’s how one  New Yorker  article described her. I guess you can say it’s in the way she carries herself. As a performer, she’s confident—never timid. Usually warm, not always. You can see it in some of her most iconic roles. As Nora, in  The Leftovers , she’s angry and kind of tightly wound, traumatized by the loss of her family. On season three of  Fargo , where she played Police Chief Gloria Burgle: brave in the face of danger but also baffled at humanity’s capacity to be so violent and cruel. She’s starring in the new film  The Nest The Nest  was directed by Sean Durkin, who previously made the acclaimed film  Martha Marcy May Marlene . In  The Nest , Carrie plays Allison. Allison is married to Rory, played by Jude Law. Together, they and their two kids move from upstate New York to an estate outside London, where Rory grew up. Indirectly, the move causes their marriage to crumble. I say “indirectly” because—as you see in the film—the new home doesn’t create any new issues for the couple. It just brings up their existing problems. Before we get into the interview—which is conducted by the wonderful Linda Holmes from NPR’s  Pop Culture Happy Hour —let’s listen to a little bit from the film. In this clip, Allison has just learned that her husband has received the job offer that will take the family to the UK. sound effect Music swells and fades. clip Allison ( The Nest : This would be our fourth move in ten years.  Rory [Softly.]  Don’t look backwards. Look forwards. This is a fresh start.  Allison : This was our fresh start. This was our permanent move, remember?  Rory : Yeah, well. Things don’t always work out as planned.  Allison [Interrupting.]  Yeah, things never work out the way we plan.  [Sounds of shuffling.] Rory : I moved back here for you, to be near your family.  [Beat.]  It’s not working for me. I… I don’t know what else to tell you.  [Beat.] Allison : Oh, for  [censored]  sake, Rory. sound effect Music swells and fades. linda holmes Carrie Coon! Welcome to  Bullseye carrie coon Thank you so much for having me. linda This is a— carrie I’m such an NPR nerd. linda Oh! Good! Well, perfect. That’s a—that is the perfect place to start. You know, listening to that clip, it’s a very tense marriage. carrie Mm. Aren’t they all, right now?  [They laugh.] linda Yeah, that’s right, these people are sort of cooped up together. They’re relocating to London, but they’re not even—they’re, yeah, that’s true. They’re not even stuck in the pandemic yet. They’re just very, very tense. What did you like about that role and that kind of marriage as a thing to play with? carrie Oddly, the marriage felt—to me—egalitarian in a way that marriage movies don’t always feel. And it was also motivated by factors that didn’t include catastrophic events like a divorce or the death of a child or infidelity. It was really about marriage and it was about the unwritten rules of a marriage, the tacit agreements we make in a marriage, about renegotiating a marriage when things aren’t working, or walking away from it—you know, that’s often what those stories are about. And so, I really loved that it was about those dynamics and I just had never seen anything done quite that way. And it also felt like a true lead in a film. I wasn’t the wife who was supporting the husband’s story. It was a story about these two people. And frankly, I’d—I just don’t get invited to those parties very often, either. So, it was flattering to be asked and I—it was really specific, and it felt very real to me. And it reminded me a little bit of the marriages I had grown up around. Not the tension!  [Laughs.]  The egalitarian part. linda Yeah. It’s interesting that you mention that, ‘cause I think if I were trying to describe to someone kind of what this movie is about, I think that’s the only thing I would really—you sort of wanna say, “Well, it’s about this marriage. It’s about this family where they move and then they have to just kind of figure out what comes next.” And as you say, it doesn’t really have that big plot incident. And it is, in that way, I think an unusual structure.  [Carrie agrees.]  Why do you think there aren’t more scripts that get made that are like that? carrie Well, I think often smart scripts don’t get made. And we had the benefit of, you know—Sean had such a wonderful debut with  Martha Marcy May Marlene  and so people were hungry for his second feature. And so, we were able to get the funding we needed to make it. But often, scripts that are smart and specific don’t make it into production or they don’t get distributed. So, it’s not that I don’t occasionally read them. It’s just they never get made.  [Linda agrees.]  Which is too bad. linda It’s surprising to me to hear you say—I mean, maybe it shouldn’t be surprising, but it surprises me to hear you say that you don’t necessarily get a lot of opportunities to play leads, ‘cause I feel like—as somebody who follows and writes about television—I would say, “Oh, you know, she’s one of the sort of most interesting and lauded actresses working in television.” I’m surprised that those opportunities aren’t plentiful. carrie Well, you know what’s not plentiful is the scripts. So, there are probably five or six great movies with female leads that get made every year. And now think of the first 12 actresses you can—you know, that you imagine seeing featured in a film. They’re not me.  [They laugh.]  So, unless we start making more scripts like that, I don’t get the opportunity to play those parts, ‘cause I’m sort of at the end of the list  [laughing]  of actors that might—you know, you might ask. Because that’s just the reality of the business. They need to get money to make those films and someone’s international popularity matters so much. Doesn’t matter if you’re good casting!  [Laughs.]  It matters if you can get the movie made. So, unfortunately I just don’t get that chance very often. linda Yeah. You know, I was—in preparation for this, I was reading a profile of you, in the  New Yorker , and it has a subhead that says that you have a certain Midwestern pragmatism.  [Carrie chuckles.]  I lived in Minnesota for ten years and I’m wondering what you think it means when a  New Yorker  profile says you have a Midwestern pragmatism. carrie [Laughs.]  That’s a great question. I think it means—there is something of a… a willingness to be straightforward. My agents always joke that I’m never excited about anything. They—they’ll call me with good news, and I’ll say, “Yeah, no, I’ll get excited when I sign a contract.” I’m just very, very practical! And because I understand how this business works and, you know, that way disappointment lies, I think there’s a kind of  [laughing]  protective impulse, maybe? Because of course, my people tend to be pretty emotionally reserved. They’re very stoic. Our family motto that’s a joke is, “We’ll handle it.” Just sort of whatever is happening we just say, “Ah, we’ll handle it.” You know, nobody wants to talk about how  [laughing]  or how we got there. So, I don’t know. I’m nice.  [Linda laughs.]  I’m easygoing.  [They laugh.] linda ‘Cause, I mean, I think in your case it does mean something. As opposed to when—something like “Midwestern” often just means, like, white and polite. Do you know what I mean? carrie Right, yes. Some sort of cliché. Well, I appreciate that. I’m glad you think there might be some meaning in there for me somewhere. linda [Laughs.]  But I mean, I think it means something—not just that in your work it does, but that when they say it, it does. Did you grow up in the Midwest? Are you Midwestern? carrie I did. I grew up in Ohio. In fact, my entire family is still in my hometown. My parents grew up down the street from each other. I have three grandparents in their nineties and all of my siblings are there, now. In my town. Or outside of it. linda What part of Ohio? carrie The northeast, outside of Akron in a town called Copley. So, it’s—we grew up in a rural area outside of an urban area. linda What kind of a kid were you? carrie [Laughs.]  I have this idea of myself that is apparently not accurate. I imagine this very quiet, observant girl. She’s thinking about everything. And my mom would say, “No, no, no. You were so bossy and so loud.” Apparently no one was surprised but me  [laughing]  that I became an actor. But my sister was adopted from El Salvador and I felt a great responsibility for, you know, her—integrating her into the family and into the world. And so, I was really, I think, very controlling. linda What was the first acting that you did? carrie There’s a beautiful theater in my town—in Akron. The Akron Civic Theatre. It’s an atmospheric theater. It’s one of those that has the clouds and the stars projected onto the ceiling, in that magical way. And my friend took me to see a play when I was ten. And it was  Babes in Toyland . And there were kids my age onstage. And I thought, “What?! How do they—? What!?” So, I came home, and I got our little local paper and I looked up the Weathervane Community Playhouse where, incidentally, my grandfather had done a couple of plays after World War Two. And I asked my mom if I could go on auditions. And she said no  [laughing]  because there were five kids in my family and my parents worked full time. She does not remember this. She says that that is fictional. However, I was interested in it. But I didn’t actually act until I got to high school and I played a very small Sister Bertha in the  Sound of Music , just way in the background. I’m sure singing all the wrong notes. And then I ended up getting the lead in  Our Town  my senior year, when I was waiting for soccer practice to start. And I did a—you know, a woeful production of  Our Town , at my high school. But I knew it was a good play and I felt my power. I’m a middle child, so I was obviously really hungry for some attention. So, when I had an audience in my thrall, that was it. I was really compelled by that information. But I didn’t actually get—go full-on into acting until I went to graduate school, after undergrad. And I got into University of Wisconsin at the very last minute. I was the very last person that they took. Ten actors over three years. And, you know. linda And what’s the—what’s the path from there to Chicago, right? carrie Well, my last year of my three-year program, I did  ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore , with a gentleman named David Franks who was running the American Players Theatre out in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Which is an outdoor classical theater and amphitheater. It’s about 1,100 seats. And he invited me to join their apprenticeship program that summer. And we also organized a program where we invited casting directors from around the country to come and audition us, to see if we could get more work and agents and things. And I ended up getting an agent in Chicago through that program. And then one of the directors, who I had worked with, gave me my first play in Chicago. So, James Bohnen hired me at Remy Bumppo Theatre and so it just—all the directors I was working with were based out of Chicago. I’m a Midwesterner. I had just gone to school in Wisconsin. So, it just made sense to transition there since I was getting a foothold. So, I ended up doing—you know, doing a few plays and starting to go out on commercial auditions and eventually got a guest star spot on TV. But then—you know, then  Virginia Woolf  happened, and I didn’t stay there very long. linda Talk a little bit about that  Virginia Woolf  performance, which I know was very huge for you. carrie It was huge. Well, in Chicago, generally plays are cast about a year in advance. So we all know, as actors, what every theater company is doing. They’ve all announced their seasons, so you can look at the season and know there are three or four parts that I could get if I’m really lucky. And so, I knew that Honey was one of the only ones in my age range that would be auditioning that season. And I had been into Steppenwolf. Erica Daniels, who was the casting director there at the time, had actually been one of my judges at the URTA auditions. But I really felt connected to Honey and I was really— [sighs]  I worked on it in a way I’d never worked on an audition before and  [chuckles]  I got it! And I really felt very possessive. I felt like it—that—it felt like the right time for me to get that thing. I was ready, you know, I was ready to step up into that space and take ownership of it. linda And that’s the show where you met your husband, yes? carrie Yeees!  [Laughs.]  Yes, it is. Unexpectedly for both of us, yes. linda Yeees! You are married to the wonderful actor and playwright Tracy Letts. Who— carrie [Dreamily.]  I am. I like him. linda [Laughing.]  You know, I think a lot of people like him.  [Carrie laughs.]  If there is anybody out there who is thinking, “I’m not sure if I know who that is,” you might know him as Saoirse Ronan’s father in  Lady Bird , a variety of other wonderful things. I have to ask you, ‘cause I read about this, did you really get married in a hospital? carrie We really did. We truly did. We both had a—you know, Tracy went out to LA in his thirties and couldn’t get arrested, and so it was interesting. After  Virginia Woolf , he actually started to get his first television offers.  Homeland  was the first job that came his way. So, after  Virginia Woolf  happened, we were both working a lot. And we were apart a lot. And we had registered to get married and in Illinois I think you have 60 days to get married or else you have to reregister. And we had no time to go back and do all the paperwork again. So, I was filming  Gone Girl,  and I was coming home on a Friday night and Saturday was our—the expiration date for our registration. And he was gonna leave to do  Homeland , like, the following week or something crazy. So I said, “We have to go Saturday and get married.” And so, I got in at about 1 a.m. and he opened the door and he just looked terrible and he said, “I do not feel well.” And we go to the emergency room. He’s sweating. He goes into surgery and, on Saturday, he has emergency gallbladder surgery. And our registration is dead! That was the last day! But on Sunday, I thought, “Eh.” I brought our rings to the hospital and I said, “Is the chaplain around?” And I was on the phone with my mom in Tracy’s room and I brought this little sundress that I cast off on a chair. And there’s a knock on the door and this woman pokes her head in. She says, “I’m Robin! I’m a Lutheran!” We’re like, “Okay!” So, I said, “Mom! I gotta go! I’m getting married.” So, I was in Tracy’s T-shirt and he was high as a kite. You know. He had—he’s sober 27 years, so he hadn’t had  [laughing]  any drugs in his body for a really long time. So, we went through this improvised, very slow  [chuckling]  ceremony in our room. Tracy, off the shoulder, you know, hospital gown. We took some pictures of our grippy socks and our hands, ‘cause the rest of them were really terrible. And then she brought us some grape juice and some challah bread and then Tracy went to sleep. So. Yeah.  [Chuckling.]  It was great. linda Wow! How do you—how do you feel about that being your wedding story? carrie I feel great. I never—you know, my parents had a modest, Midwestern—you know, modest wedding. My parents are not materialistic, so I never dreamt of some big production and I never had any pressure to have one. And, at that point in my life, I had done a lot of dressing up in some very magnificent clothing. So, I wasn’t hungry for any, you know, day that was my own. I recognize that for some women, it’s—it really is the most important and special day, and they don’t get that kind of pageantry in their lives. But I didn’t need any more pageantry in my life. So, I never planned to have a big wedding. We thought about maybe getting our families together for a small backyard party. But, you know, it just never happened because we—once we got married, we were just back on the road again. linda Yeah. It’s interesting. You have probably the best excuse I’ve ever heard for anyone who says, “Why didn’t I get to come to your wedding?” carrie Yes! But my dad was like, “Oh, you had to drug him to get him to marry you?” My brothers, too. They’re like, “Ohh, okay. That’s the only way he would do it, huh?” linda So, I think  Gone Girl  is the first thing I remember hearing a lot about you in, was  Gone Girl . Which, of course, was David Fincher. That was sort of a significant pivot from doing more theater to doing this film. Right? carrie Mm-hm. Yeah, it was really easy.  [Beat, laughs.]  Just kidding! Well, what had happened is I had—I had—we’d just had the Tony Awards. I had booked  The Leftovers  pilot and I’d already shot the pilot. And I went out to LA and HBO wasn’t sure they were gonna release me to audition for Fincher to actually even be considered for  Gone Girl . And then eventually HBO worked it out. And so, I immediately—in that August, after shooting the pilot—went out and started shooting almost immediately in Cape Girardeau, in Missouri. And then wrapped that in February and started, immediately, on  The Leftovers . I think I even overlapped a couple of weeks. So, I came from the theater and then I went to Fincher film school before I—before I got into doing  The Leftovers . But they came out in the reverse order. So,  Leftovers  started before  Gone Girl , you know, opened. So for me, it was weird to see my work backwards, ‘cause I thought I got better.  [They laugh.]  But it was great. I mean, Fincher really—I adore him. We got on really well. And I just—I really relate to—his sense of humor is right up my alley. It’s very dry and very dark. And he taught me—he would say, “Look at the monitor. You see what I’m doing? This is why I need you to glide out on your right foot.” And he just taught me a lot about being on camera. ‘Cause I didn’t even know the vocabulary yet. jesse Even more with Carrie Coon still to come.

She’s starring alongside Jude Law in the new film  The Nest , which is available to rent online now. Her interviewer is our pal Linda Holmes, who’s the host of NPR’s  Pop Culture Happy Hour . Let’s get back into it. linda For people who haven’t seen  The Leftovers —HBO show based on a Tom Perrotta novel. If you haven’t seen it, it takes place three years after this global event that they called the Sudden Departure. Two percent of the population has vanished and Nora lives in Mapleton, New York. Not the Midwest! She’s the only person in town who’s kind of lost her entire immediate family. When you started to explore the character of Nora, she was—in the pilot, she’s not—she doesn’t seem as central as she becomes later. Is that an accurate—is that an accurate sort of sense of the story?  [Carrie confirms.]  Did you have a sense then that she would eventually be that? Or is that something that became clearer as the three seasons of the show went on? carrie That absolutely became clearer as we went on. I think Tom and Damon became invested in the Nora/Kevin relationship and they recognized that there was something about it that felt really central to the show. And so, it just became a bigger part of the piece. And I didn’t expect it to continue to grow to the point where I would get to finish it out in that spectacular fashion. So, I was really flattered, of course. Because I didn’t work that much those first four episodes! And then episode six came and that was the first time in my life I’d ever been basically in every frame of something for—you know—a whole shoot. I’d really only done a scene here and there up until that point. And so, there was a lot of pressure  [laughs]  to deliver that episode. And then, yeah. It kept growing from there. linda Yeah, one of the things I find so fascinating about that show is that, you know, as I said—it starts off in a situation where it kind of, other than this Sudden Departure—which is a pretty vague “other than”—but other than that, it is a pretty grounded show. Like, you can kind of imagine it being a pretty—a pretty real idea of what the world might look like if this very, very kind of fantastical event happened. But as it goes on, it kind of gets more and more surreal and strange and, to me, kind of cool and interesting. Does it change the performance at all, as the show gets kind of more bent? Does it call on any different skills or is it all just Nora is now in a different kind of situation? carrie I think it is Nora in a different situation. You know, the first season’s based on the book and Tom Perrotta was exploring, in his very special way, collective grieving. He wrote that book shortly after 9/11. And so, the first season’s grounded in the book in a way that the rest of the seasons just aren’t. There’s a—there is a lot more humor and it kind of loosens up a little bit. I mean, Tom’s books are very funny, but that’s not what our season one was really like. And so, I always say, when you—when you come back to shoot a season, it feels like putting on a wet bathing suit. Like, I know this is my bathing suit, but it’s really uncomfortable.  [Chuckles.]  So. It always felt a little strange to start and we never—the way Damon was working, we sort of never knew what was going to happen. We didn’t know we were going to Texas or Australia ‘til very close to when it was time to leave. I usually got just a few days with an episode before we were shooting it. And when you contrast that with somebody like Noah Hawley on  Fargo , I had—you know—six episodes before we even started the season. So, it was just a really—you just had to accept the unknown and the uncertainty of it. And that was a lot of fun. It was really liberating. And I have to say, Nora Durst did feel like a character who was capable of anything. And so, nothing ever felt uncomfortable to do or out of—or something that she wouldn’t attempt or didn’t feel out of line for her. And it was such a joy as an actor, because it did call on so many parts of me and so often women’s roles in particular, I think, are very narrow in their scope of expression. And so, for me to have Nora Durst be at once, you know, dark and sad but also filled with rage but also funny but also very physical—it was—it was such a challenge and it was so much fun to be—to be pushed in that way and to be asked to do those things. And so, it was really just a fun ride. You know. It’s as fun a ride as it is to watch. And of course, you know, unfortunately it’s feeling more grounded and realistic than ever.  [Chuckles.]  ‘Cause a lot of people have been watching it during the pandemic. linda You’ve talked so much—you talked so much, when you were discussing, you know, being a young kid who was interested in theater and visited the local theater. You seem like you’re a person who really is kind of still of theater communities. I’m wondering how—I’m wondering what you think theaters need from people right now. carrie Well. The theater is decimated. And my community is really suffering. There’s a lot of just economic hardship right now among actors and people who work in all facets of the business and most of the theater companies are not gonna survive, because we live in a country that doesn’t support the arts. So, we rely so much on ticket sales and grants and—you know, the Trump administration, every year they were in charge, tried to diminish the funds for the museums, for the—you know—operas and for public broadcasting and, you know, there have been a few republicans who have managed to keep them from entirely eliminating that funding, but that’s changing now too. So, I’m really afraid for my theater community. And right now, you know, people keep asking me sort of, “What do you envision is next?” It’s like, there’s—right now there’s no next. There’s too much pain. And, in addition to that, we have these institutional conversations happening about what are the ways that, as liberal organizations, we have failed in the Black Lives Matter movement and—you know, just sort of bringing forward the voices we have a responsibility to make space for. There’s room for everybody. But we—you know, it shouldn’t be—this shouldn’t be a—these resources are not finite. You know. Art is not finite. Love is not finite. There’s space. But institutions haven’t necessarily made that—made those choices very consciously. So, you know, there’s a—there’s a bigger struggle going on if we even do get to come back. And of course, I also say, the way arts function, they’re a necessary component of any society and they are ultimately gonna tell the history of this moment. And that means that new companies will start, and younger and more vital voices will start to emerge and there probably had to be a big shift like this. And so, something amazing will come out of it. I’m just not the person to say what it’s gonna look like or what it will be. But right now, it’s just a lot of, like, very real pain and very real… just material lack for people who can’t work. And a lot of my friends are—you know, they’re gonna be forced out of the business. You know, in Europe, every small town has a theater that’s subsidized by the government. And they grow up seeing Chekov and Shakespeare and Shaw and you know, they—the actors that work in Europe are on a salary. And that’s all they do. And they don’t have to do eight shows a week. They work in rep and so they get to be artists. And in America, there’s a sort of shame around saying, “I’m an artist.” We have to say, “I’m an artist, but I also—I’m also working on this or that or this podcast. Or I have this other thing going.” We’re not allowed to claim it. There’s a real—I don’t know. The attitude toward the arts is getting more and more dire.  [Chuckles.]  Even though we’re great consumers of it! But I don’t think people understand what would happen if it was gone. linda Yeah. I do wanna talk a little bit about  The Nest . Where was that shot? carrie We shot the American side up in Toronto for about a week. And then we took a little break and then we went over the pond and we went up outside of Oxfordshire and we shot in a manor house up there that had been in the Churchill and Spencer family for, you know, 400 years. So. linda It’s a nice—it’s a nice house. carrie It is! And there are a lot of weddings there. We actually made it look shabby. It doesn’t look shabby. It’s very cool. And, you know, there’s medieval architecture in it and you’re shooting a scene and one of the owners will pop through a bookcase to grab their reading glasses. So it’s a pretty unusual space. linda Oh, so they were—they were still there! They were living there. carrie They were! Yeah, they were—they have their sort of apartments. You know. They use the rest of the house for events. And they kind of sequestered themselves in the smaller part of the house. But they were lovely, and they were around and there were horses onset. So, everybody was having a great time just out on the grounds and taking a walk and—it was beautiful. Just beautiful. linda You’re acting with Jude Law in this movie. I just saw him in the HBO series  The Third Day carrie [Gasps.]  Yes, I can’t wait to watch that! linda Yeah! And in both, he’s kind of this, like, raggedy husband—if I can put it that way.  [Carrie laughs.]  And I’m always interested in how people feel like that transition from, like, your twenties to your thirties to your forties works, because for him—the thing I remember about him, when he was very young, was just that he was so beautiful. Right? Not that he wasn’t also a good actor, but that he was so beautiful. And now, he’s kind of playing these, like, grimier… like, grimier dudes. These raggedy husbands. And I’m wondering what do you—how do you think that that path is different for women? ‘Cause I know it’s different for women. carrie Yeah. Yeah. Well, the character parts for women start to dry up when we get most interesting. Because ingénue parts—you might be young and beautiful, but they’re not gonna last forever. And if you can’t transition out of them, then you’re gonna have a very short career. And they’re not as much fun to play! You know. There’s a lot of naiveté and, you know, moony eyes and it’s not very interesting. It’s the—it is the kind of, you know, nasty, schlubby husbands and villains that are more fun. Their motivations are more interesting and more complicated, generally. At least, the way they’re written. So, I’m not surprised to see Jude trafficking in that territory. Yeah, for women, I just feel like maybe TV is shifting this conversation a little bit. We’ve certainly seen very interesting parts for women on television. My own parts included. We see, now, movie stars coming to do television, because that’s where the more interesting roles are, because—again—there aren’t that many scripts made every year that have interesting, powerful female parts and the same two, three, four women are gonna get those parts. linda It’s interesting that you say that about the parts in television, ‘cause I do wanna talk a little bit about  Fargo . I feel like it’s one of those shows that comes back almost for the purpose of giving, like, cool parts to people  [chuckling]  if that makes sense.  [Carrie confirms.]  Like, it’s a real—it’s a real actor’s show. And it— carrie Yeah! Jean Smart! Come on! linda What was the appeal of  Fargo , for you? Did I—have I just described the appeal of  Fargo [laughing]  for you? carrie Largely. Well, one of the appealing parts was that I met with Noah and then I—they offered me the job, which  [laughing]  is not normally how those parts would go for me.  The Leftovers  I had to audition for. So, that was one of the first times where somebody said, “Hey! We would like you to play this part!” So, yes. That was very enticing. But, in addition to that, the way that Noah is entering our current political atmosphere and socio-economic atmosphere obliquely with the stories he’s telling outside of time, the way he gives us distance to process things that are happening in our world, but with, you know, the sort of cushion of entertainment is, I think, maybe unparalleled. I think what he does is really astonishing. And he’s very willing to take a chance on a lesser-known actor if he thinks they’re right for the part. It’s all about whether he thinks they’re right for the part. And every now and then, he does get just someone in his mind that he thinks—you know, and he almost builds a character around them or he just pictures—you know, like Andrew Bird, right, is in this season. He’s just like, “Yeah! I just thought he’d be good at it.” He’s never acted before, but Noah just has an instinct. And he tends to assemble just casts of people who are—who are there to tell a story. You know. There’s not a lot of prima donna behavior on a  Fargo  set. And yes, he was leaning into my Midwestern pragmatism!  [Linda laughs.]  And the legacy of  Fargo —you know, to have the cop, the lady cop. So, it’s fun to be part of that legacy. I mean, Frances McDormand is part of that legacy! That’s the kind of club I wanna be in! linda Yeah, and you know, you talk about Frances McDormand. What is it like to take on a role that has at least echoes of a performance that’s really iconic and beloved? carrie You can’t think about it or you won’t get out of bed.  [They laugh.]  Well, what’s wonderful about a well-written script is that everything you need is on the page. And Noah Hawley’s writing is so specific. It’s really specific. And specific writing is much easier to act than something that is vague and general. So, when you have specific writing and then you add onto that a dialect, a cop uniform, a 15-pound belt, a winter coat, a heavy pair of boots, you’re practically doing it  [laughing]  without—before you even open your mouth. So—so, a lot of—I have found that the—as I’ve gotten older, my process has become a little bit more outside-in. I think I would have classified myself as sort of an intellectual actor. You know, a nerdy actor who liked to read a lot of things. And now that I have a kid and so much less time,  [laughs]  I focus a lot more on—you know, how are—how are the ways I’m being remade, externally, and can I be present in the moment? Which is basically what my job is, even if I feel underprepared. But yeah, you can’t think about those performances that came before you, because thinking about a performance isn’t active. If you’re playing a character, they’re just a person and they want something. And your job in a scene is to try to get that thing. So, you know, that stuff’s in the back of your mind. But it’s really all just decided on the internet.  [They laugh.] linda I feel like a couple different times in this conversation I’ve asked you sort of what draws you to a part and you’ve been trying to tell me.  [Carrie chuckles.]  To some degree, you take parts that are  [laughing]  available. Do you know what I mean? Not you, specifically, too—but, like, that actors do in general. And I even remember like—I hear—I remember hearing Paul Rudd say the same thing. Saying, like, people sometimes think that you have, like, infinity roles to pick from and you’re picking them just based on some very specific algorithm. Do you think people misunderstand how much acting is, in some ways, like other jobs? carrie Yeah! Except we get rejected more. We interview more and we get rejected more.  [Laughing.]  Otherwise, it’s just like other jobs. I’m like, “Oh! You had—you had two job interviews this year? I had 27! And I got none of them!”  [They laugh.]  So, yeah. It’s a little bit—it’s a little bit different. I love—you always hear stories of, like, families saying to their newly graduated actor, “You know, they’re shooting a film up in Cleveland. Why don’t you do that one?”  [Laughs.]  I’m like, “Yeah, oh, that’d be great, if I could just call somebody and get a job.” But yeah! It is largely—and that’s why you also see actors having to make shrewd decisions about the kind of work they do. You might see this—your favorite indie actor is suddenly in a big—is in a Marvel movie and you thought, “I didn’t think that person would ever do a Marvel movie!” But if that person doesn’t do a Marvel movie, then that person is not allowed to do the independent film that they love, because that independent film needs money and that person—that actor has to have a strong enough profile to justify carrying that movie for investors. So we have to make really shrewd decisions about the kind of art we make, sometimes. Until we get to a certain place where, you know, we have infinite resources and… you know, we’re Meryl Streep.  [Chuckles.] linda Right. I think there are lot of people who don’t necessarily know that that is the way that movies get made. You know, the script can exist, but that nothing happens until you attach a famous person. Often. carrie Yes! That’s right. There’s so many wonderful scripts that are in a—you know, on a shelf collecting dust because they couldn’t get somebody big enough to sign onto them. It’s really sad! There are these beautiful stories that don’t get told. linda When you think about the things that you would most want the opportunity to do, what do those things look like? carrie It’s so funny. I always—I always think, “Well, I don’t know yet because I haven’t read it!” I want to be challenged. I want to make scripts about women that look like the women I know. You know. That have the same level of complication as the women in my life. I like to do things that are physical, so I would absolutely do something that was just, “We’re gonna go out in the jungle and jump from tree to tree.” And I would say, “Yes, I’m gonna do that.” So, some of it is just what kind of challenge is it. You know, I get a lot of scripts about dead children and I’m like, “I did that one already!” I’d like to do something else! But a lot of the women’s stories are pretty narrow in their scope. Like I said about, you know, the kinds of things we’re allowed to do. So, I don’t know. I guess it’s—that—this is why you see all these actresses starting production companies. Because then they get to curate the kind of scripts that are gonna get made. Elisabeth Moss is doing a marvelous job picking up some kind of obscure, really interesting, really complicated stories and she has the star power, right now, to get that stuff made. You’re gonna see—you know, Rachel Brosnahan is doing the same thing. She’s picking properties and it’s the only way we have any control over what material we can participate in, out in the world, and create opportunities for other people, too—that aren’t necessarily being vetted at the top level. linda Carrie Coon, thank you so much for coming on  Bullseye carrie Thank you so much for having me. I’m—I feel that this is a little arrow in my quiver. jesse Carrie Coon. Her film  The Nest  is available to rent online right now. Go check it out. And when Linda Holmes isn’t helping us out, she hosts the great NPR podcast,  Pop Culture Happy Hour , which is super-fun. She’s also a book author. Her latest book is a novel, called  Evvie Drake Starts Over . It came out last year. It’s great. I loved it. I was just thinking about it yesterday, how great it was. Go check that out, too. music Bright, brassy music with light vocalizations. jesse That’s the end of another episode of  Bullseye Bullseye  is created from the homes of me and the staff of Maximum Fun, in and around greater Los Angeles, California—where it was briefly colder, so I went and got my sweaters from the garage. Then it was 92 degrees outside. The show is produced by speaking into microphones. Our producer is Kevin Ferguson. Jesus Ambrosio and Jordan Kauwling are our associate producers. We get help from Casey O’Brien and Kristen Bennett. Our interstitial music is by Dan Wally, also known as DJW. Our theme song is by The Go! Team. Thanks very much to them and to their label, Memphis Industries, for sharing it with us. If you wanna hear the latest about what we’re up to, you can keep up with the show on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. We post all of our interviews there. And I think that’s about it. Just remember: all great radio hosts have a signature signoff. promo Speaker Bullseye with Jesse Thorn  is a production of  MaximumFun.org  and is distributed by NPR.\""

Fair enough. James— biz I—we are so excited to have you here. And just so everybody knows who James is—besides delightful— james Thank you. biz —uh, he’s an actor; a comedian; a Marvel correspondent; and host, writer, director, dancer, and choreographer. He is also  [through laughter]  the host of Maximum Fun’s  Minority Korner , which is a podcast that takes an introspective look at the world through an intersectional lens. James? Thank you so much for joining us and I hope you’ve got some dance moves that’ll help us— crosstalk James : Yeah! A five, six—  Biz : —dance our way to success!  [Laughs.] james A-five, six, seven eight! Let’s get into formation, as Beyoncé told us to do.  [Biz laughs.]  I—  [Laughs.] biz Love it! james But it’s--y’know, dance can actually be very, uh, therapeutic, you know? To channel the pain and the energy. I actually—to plug something else—I teach Zoom dance classes on Saturdays. Uh— biz Oh, no. crosstalk James : Yeah! It’s—it’s true! Let’s do it!  [Laughs.]  Yeah!  Biz One Bad Mother  listeners? Get ready! We are going to a Zoom class!  [Laughs.]  I love it! james It’s, uh, in honor of Pride Month we’re doing Lady Gaga and Rihanna’s new jam. I—just because we can’t Pride physically together, we can Pride together in our homes. And, y’know, just channel a lot of the, uh… pain that we’re experiencing and just sort of, uh, have an outlet for that and dance together. biz Well, now I’m in love.  [James laughs.]  Before I ask you how you’re doing, James, I just wanna take a moment to do something we’ve been doing since the pandemic? And feels—every week—more and more important to do. First? We wanna say thank you to all of the, uh, front line… essential workers. All the people who are out there helping to not only keep us safe during this pandemic, but to help work on and find ways to… uh, end this pandemic or at least slow it down ‘cause my children need to be back at school, people!  [James laughs.]  Uh—  [Laughs.]  Selfish! Thank you guys so much for that. james 110%! I’m just gonna give some snaps to that!  [Snaps.] biz I will take the snaps!  [James laughs.]  I also wanna say that… we are recording this on a Friday. We are coming to the end of—what is it now? Two weeks—ten days—of peaceful protests in our country. Supporting Black Lives Matters? Uh—and I—again—want to thank all of those who are able to be on the front lines? Of this? Who are protesting. Who are… using peaceful demonstration means. Who are looking out for each other. I think—again—when I say the things that like make me like people again? And like them? Is when I see… people… really… relating and connecting and… picking each other up! james Yeah. biz I know that it can feel like… does this matter? Is this helping? Is this gonna be the time that we take another step forward? And I just—I don’t know. I’m just here to say thank you to everybody who’s stepping.  [Laughs.] james Yeah. biz Let’s just keep stepping! james Keep stepping! Keep on stepping! That’s, uh, it’s—it’s what—it’s not that—it’s what we have to do. There is no other option. Like, there’s no… you don’t just get to sit back and eat bon-bons and, y’know, watch Netflix. Like—  [Laughs.]  You can use that as a tool? To catch your breath? But that can’t be—it can’t just be escapism. It can’t just be being comfortable because that’s how we got ourselves in this situation in the first place. biz Woo! I can’t wait for us to talk.  [James laughs.]  In the topic. So everybody, we—we see you. And—as always—along with seeing, let’s make sure we’re really listening. We’re really listening. Finally, I just wanna give a shoutout to Theresa? Who is… still taking time off and I hope she takes all the time that she needs to be with her family. We love you, Theresa. And you’re doing—you’re doing a remarkable job. With that said—James? Here’s a loaded question! james Okay! biz How are you?  [Laughs.] james Oooh! Yeah. I—you know, oh, man, that’s a lot. How much time do we have? Um, we—  [Laughs.] biz Forever, if you want! Whatever!  [Laughs.] james I’ll answer in this moment. Because it’s honestly—it’s—it’s—it’s sort of moment-to-moment. And, um… there’s a—a heaviness that I—I feel? I feel—it feels, uh, like there’s just this heaviness. But at the same time I guess I feel cautiously optimistic in this moment? Because of the—what I’m seeing, um, specifically non-black people get in formation—to quote Beyoncé, if I can. Y’know? Um, and doing it from—I think—an authentic place? And I feel… seen? For the first time? I—I feel like last time when this happened, it felt like… there was so much time that was wasted with like arguing the merits of like Black Lives Matter. And I feel like… I’m not having to have those conversations. And I feel seen. And… um, in some ways it’s kind of a vulnerable feeling? biz Ooh! Okay. james Um, because it’s like you—you see my struggle. My journey. That I’m not making this up. Y’know? That it’s—it’s—it’s sort of this—this background radiation that every black person has always walked with? Um, it’s interesting that George Floyd was—y’know—killed with this knee—we’ve all sort of felt that pressure of that knee our entire life and existence— biz Oof. james —and now everyone, um, can see it. So… I’m sad. Um, it’s Breonna Taylor’s—it would’ve been her 27th birthday. Y’know. She was also shot and killed by police just sitting in her own home. An essential worker? One of the ones that we’re just praising about. We’re in the middle of a pandemic? So… yeah. I—I’m—and I’m trying to just give myself grace because it’s like—I’m—we’re in a—take the worst parts of the last, like, hundred years. We’re experiencing them all at once. It’s the 1918 pandemic; the Great Depression; the Civil Rights movement; all happening at once? biz Oh, wait. We sent men into space in America. crosstalk James : Oh yeah! That happened too! Yeah!  Biz : Don’t forget that one! I thought that was like— biz —such a, like—  [James laughs.]  —little historic cherry on the top of like history coming back! I was like, I’m not—I’m not missing this! Oh—oh, are we gonna send a rocket into space? All of these other things  [through laughter]  must be happening!  [Laughs.] james It’s all there! So it’s the, uh, I don’t wanna say the greatest hits, but there’s certainly the hits that happen. And so I’m just trying to give myself as much, uh, grace as I possibly can? While still… uh… being active and engaged. But, um, thank you for asking. It, um… it’s—it almost feels like a funeral hopping? ‘Cause I’m getting a lot of, like, white folks coming to me? And they’re asking me like—how are you doing? And I—I can take that on? Not every black person can. So you have to sort of learn how to dance with each person because they’re each experiencing it differently? Um, but I—I have appreciated it because it’s an attempt to try to be active. So. Thank you. Um, how are you doing? Huh? There’s a lot going on! biz First I’m gonna say—that’s very generous of you.  [Laughs.] [James laughs.]  To be—to be, uh, willing to do that dance. Uh— james A lot of therapy and a lot of, like, self-help and meditation have gotten me to this space? So.  [Laughs.] biz Yessss. I did—love the therapy. It is helpful. Um, I’m all—I mean, I’m alright? Let’s get real. I’m healthy and I’m white.  [Laughs.] crosstalk James : Fair. Fair. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Biz : I think—y’know, like— biz I’m a woman. That’s not as good. But—y’know. There ya go. I am looking forward to us having a chance to—to talk about this. But… that said, it is deeply—it’s—it’s—I think every day… over the last… couple of weeks specifically—and we’ve—look. We’ve been dealing as best we can… and as mindfully as we can on this show… since we’ve started. james Mm-hm. biz With… inclusion and learning and—and trying to figure out, like… where our voices can be helpful, y’know. And—uh, and when they can’t.  [Laughs.] [James laughs.]  Just have to—to shut up! Which I— james It’s a healthy place to also be! Like, know when to lead and know when to follow. Like, you get—some—I think the best thing I’ve ever heard, sometimes being an ally—and I had to do this, too, as, y’know, I—y’know, may be a queer black man, but I also at—do have male privilege. And so… I… being an ally is like being the intern. You’re there to listen, support, and get the coffee. So.  [Laughs.] biz That’s right! That’s right. But that’s exactly right. But I thought that that actually would be a really great place? To segue into? What we are gonna talk about today. Which is… parents being the front line against… uh, racism. music Banjo strums; cheerful banjo music continues through dialogue. theresa Please—take a moment to remember: If you’re friends of the hosts of  One Bad Mother , you should assume that when we talk about other moms, we’re talking about you. biz If you are married to the host of  One Bad Mother , we definitely are talking about you. theresa Nothing we say constitutes professional parenting advice. biz Biz and Theresa’s children are brilliant, lovely, and exceedingly extraordinary. theresa Nothing said on this podcast about them implies otherwise.  [Banjo music fades out.] [Biz and James repeatedly affirm each other as they discuss the weekly topic.] biz James. james Yes. biz I would like to start… with… talking a little bit about  Minority Korner . Tell us a little bit about the history of the show. And—and why you started it and what’s come out of it. james Yeah! Thanks! Um, so it started with, uh, Nnekay FitzClarke, who’s been on this show before. biz Yesssss!  [James laughs.] james She’s literally—she’s, like, my best friend. My sister. We’ve—went to college together. I’ve known her for, y’know, ages at this point. Y’know? Honestly, it actually really started around the time—I’d say about six years ago—this show’s been running since 2015 in June. And it was mainly because we were listening to a lot of, y’know, podcasts but there wasn’t any podcasts that were talking about intersectional sort of issues. You know? We love talking about news and history and pop culture, but Ferguson was happening and some of our favorite shows weren’t addressing it. And it was like, this is affecting me! Ferguson was the first time—with Michael Brown—I realized I was a second-class citizen in this country. And that is—what an awakening to finally sort of come to ‘cause I was spoon-fed these ideas of, well, y’know, Martin Luther King happened. Waved a wand. Racism was over and then Obama! We did it!  [Biz laughs.]  And, um—  [Laughs.]  Y’know? That was the finish line. Woo! That was—and that wasn’t the case. And so we were just always having these conversations and we’re like, oh, we should be recording this! And then we did. And, y’know, we talk about… y’know, pop culture. News. History. Just whatever’s going on in our lives but it comes from a voice that isn’t hard—or at least it really wasn’t hard—too much back then. Now there are other podcasts with, y’know, kind of a similar matchup as us? And I’m grateful for that? There should be as many of those voices as possible. And I think that’s the other side and somewhat heartbreaking thing is that we started this podcast five or six years ago in response to, like, the awareness. Because this was always happening. Y’know? Since the really incep—y’know, since, y’know, 1619. Since, y’know, even the history of the police that black folks have been disproportionately affected and—and—and treated and killed and murdered and lynched in this country. And that’s always been happening. But, y’know, here it is. We started this podcast in response to… everybody coming on the same page and being aware of what was happening? And here it is happening again. And it just breaks my heart so much that George Floyd’s last words were “I can’t breathe” and we heard those already. And… y’know, with Christian Cooper! Who, y’know, it could’ve turned out differently. He was just out there birdwatching. And that was the first time I saw—I think every black person sees themselves in these instances? But I saw myself in Christian Cooper. He’s black, gay, activist, worked at Marvel, and I’m like—that could’ve been me. So, um… that’s kind of the inception of  Minority Korner ? It’s still going strong. Uh, Nnekay has—she’s—she pops in and out. She has, y’know, joined the troupe of mothers. She’s on the front lines so she’s got a lot of—a lot of focus taking care of her, y’know, little baby girl! biz Yes. So… on this show, we have talked—we talk a lot about how parenting… unites us. There is a shared… parenting experience. Nobody is free from their kid taking a shit in the tub. Okay?  [James laughs.]  This is gonna happen to you one day? No one’s gonna tell you this. This is… this is a—an equalizer! That—that said!  [Laughs.]  That doesn’t mean we share the same parenting experiences. james Mm. Mm-hm. biz Parenting being a shared experience. Sharing the same parenting experiences. So… when I—I hear us say that we’re on the front lines? I still think there are different lines that we are… we are hitting. And so… and again, this goes back to what you said at the beginning about all of your white friends coming up and being like—are you okay? james Yeah.  [Biz laughs.]  Yes. Sure. crosstalk Biz : Are you—are you okay? And can I—how are you?  James : How are you doing? What can I do?  [Laughs.] biz What can I do? And I—I’ve already told you—I said it before, hopefully on the show—I don’t think that is your job to answer, per se. crosstalk James : Thank you. Thank you.  [Laughs.]  Appreciate. There’s a thing called Google that, uh… that’s at your fingertips!  [Laughs.] Biz : I think—yeah! I just—wow, what the fuck! I know! Google it! Google that shit!  [Laughs.] biz Yeah! Being like, pick up a book! Um—  [James laughs.]  Just—but you have said that you were very willing to come on. And chat with us. james I am willing to be your  Dangerous Minds  teacher. Y’know? I will be—like, imagine—‘cause they always flip it the inverse, that it’s, y’know, these POC kids who need a teacher? No. I’ma be y’all’s black teacher—  [Biz laughs.] crosstalk James : Turning my chair around and being like—let’s get real. Y’know? I’ma do that to you. Yeah. You are the inner-city kids and we need to have a conversation.  [Laughs.]  I’m willing.  Biz : That’s right! Woo! Mr.! Mr.! That’s right!  [Laughs.]  I am the inner-city—  [Laughs.]  You have to teach me— biz Oh my god. They call me Mr. Arthur!  [James laughs.]  Okay. Um—  [Laughs.] james Yes. Yeah. biz Alright. So… I find… in the first steps… towards… helping parents navigate this… probably very specifically white parents—  [Laughs.]  Navigate this. We spend a lot of time trying to convince you that we’re not racist. Which I think is a real waste of time. james Yes. biz So… can we just move on to… james Great. biz To what’s next? Yeah. james Yeah. And I think—I think it starts with making a commitment—I think this is for everybody—um, you know, I’m also—I am also looking at this from an angle, too, I’m a—I am a One Bad Guncle. Uh, that’s a gay uncle. crosstalk Biz : Oh, I love it!  [Laughs.] James : Uh, keep that pure, people.  [Laughs.]  Um—0 james So I’m also thinking about the children in my life that I have. And I think, uh, regardless of race—and I think you put this so well—everybody has a collective responsibility. Right? I think that at the end of the day we all want equity and equality in this country. But we all have different degrees of responsibility. I wanna live in—in—into what that means in raising our children and also our own personal responsibility. Right? And so I think—um—what has to be different this go-around is making a commitment to this. Right? So starting off with yourself that, like, every day? You’re waking up with some sort of mantra of—what will I do to help end systemic racism in this country? And it’s not just enough to be like, oh, I’m not racist, but it’s anti-racism. Right? It’s like— crosstalk Biz : Yes! I love—yeah!  James : —taking down racism. james And, y’know, dismantling anti-blackness because that’s what we’re seeing here in the country. So I think it’s like—starting with yourself? And then educating yourself. Um, I think taking in… sources of… of… of black media? Whether that’s books—like, even, y’know, if you’re, like, oh, I don’t think this is for me—no! Watch a show or a TV show or a movie that has an all-black cast. Like, we have to… broaden our horizons following black bloggers. Documentaries. Books. There’s so many resources, um, so starting with yourself and then, y’know, when you move into, y’know, the children—like, all of the parents—I—I love all the parents. The parents? Like, I literally—they are our front lines because that’s the future. And I think that we really can make a commitment… that… we’re going to end police violence within our generation. In the same way that, y’know, if we look at this as like a pandemic, uh, the folks that came before us ended polio! They strived to end it and they did it. And we can do the same thing, but it’s a daily commitment and practice to it? And… I think first and foremost is checking in with yourself and you’re going to have these conversations with your children and—and there’s not a one-size fits all? All of your kids are different. I—I encour—think parents should be vulnerable about their feelings? If you’re feeling angry or you’re feeling sad, whatever that is? But just kind of organizing your feelings in a way that you can present that to your child? Because, um… whatever you model is how they’re going to also pick that up as well. And that’s why I think it’s okay to be vulnerable. If, y’know, they see dad crying over… what’s happening… whewf! What an image. Y’know? biz I think that’s a—such a wonderful approach. Tell me what your thoughts are on this. We’re raised with a narrative… that I think what’s different about then and now… is our narrative didn’t necessarily have the history behind it. Didn’t have—right? Like, it’s not enough—now I—I was raised in, like, the buckle of the Bible belt. I mean, Alabama.  [James laughs.]  Okay? james Yeah! biz The ‘70s and ‘80s. james Wow.  [Laughs.] biz So, y’know, it—oh, yes! crosstalk James : What a time!  [Laughs.] Biz : I lived—lotta stories! biz Uh, and there’s—it definitely shaped who I am. And I was lucky to have my parents. But, y’know, their parents were racists. I mean, full-on! james Right. But—but look at the key thing that you said that I wanna focus on? Is your parents. Right? Your parents moved the needle in you that much forward! And you’re doing that same thing. biz And with that needle movement, I think… when you hear people saying how is this gonna be different—as parents… what we can do to make it different is to not just say—everybody’s equal.  [Laughs.]  Y’know? Like—and we’re—we’re all the same. It’s okay. That we need to like… tie in… the… the history with it. Why we even have to say this. Right? And so… I wonder, like, how… how do we begin with that? In—like, I guess it’s like, how do we navigate this with kids? james Yeah! Well, I think what you can—I think what’s great is like I’m a huge advocate of like books.  [Laughs.]  Y’know? And—or even media. Because sometimes like I maybe don’t have the words but this can? And so you find what’s appropriate for like—there are literally, like, books for ages 3-5 with dealing with, y’know, racism or even privilege. Like, I think privilege is, y’know, very key? And you can find sort of ways I think to talk about it with your children of—y’know, if you wanna talk about like injustice. Of like, y’know, you can start talking to your child about like, uh, when—talk to me about when you had an experience that you felt was unfair. And then you can kind of bring that to… y’know… what’s going on to, y’know, how it happens to—pertains to—y’know, black people. Or, y’know, um, calling out, y’know, what these police cops did and why that was wrong. And that they did it because of the melanin of these people’s skin. Right? And then children can sort of ask questions. And it’s at different levels and different, y’know, sort of—kids’ levels. But, y’know, I think, um… tapping into the history of it is so key. Y’know, I love Black History Month? I think it’s great? And I think it should also spill into the rest of the year! biz Of every month?  [Laughs.] james Because—yeah! Exactly! Because black history is American history! Like—slavery is so tied to the foundations of this country. To, um, the economic, like, success of this country and our still-dependency on cheap and sort of free labor. And then you have the treatment of just what emanated from that. Laws and segregation and there’s, y’know, just so much—you don’t have to like—  [Laughs.]  Sit little Johnny down and put all of this on him—  [Biz laughs.]  —but I think that’s what the key is that—it’s that—remember I said in the beginning, it’s a commitment? biz Buckle up, little Johnny! james Here we go! It’s gonna be a— biz Here we go! james —you’re doing summer school at home— crosstalk James : And this is what we’re doing!  Biz : This is what summer’s gonna be!  [Laughs.] james But not a bad, y’know, little summer school program! Of like, um, and I—understanding that it’s a process. That is, you’re not gonna have one conversation and be, phewf! That was tough. Done with that. But this is literally sort of a commitment and you kind of look at, like, what are your—every family has its values and its mission statement. And however it is—  [Biz laughs.]  —that you approach that like understanding that in our family, we work towards being kind to other people. Uh, we look towards, uh, y’know, justice for other people. And dismantling systems of racism! It’s part of your family’s mission. And if we know that then we know and it leaves that space for this conversation to continuously, uh, be open and finding new media and sources and navigating the conversation. It’s gonna be awkward and clunky! You know what else is awkward and clunky? Talking to kids about sex. Right? Like, it’s—  [Laughs.] biz Yeah! Exactly! Yes! Yes. Exactly right. And that is a conversation that has to happen more than once! crosstalk James : Yes! Totally! Yeah.  Biz : You don’t just say— biz Y’know. And it—I think what’s also similar to it—we were talking about the—you were talking about, um, the bon-bons and the Netflixing and… moments like this… are… especially when they’re layered? Like what we’re going through right now? There’s a lot of layers. And I think it’s fair… y’know… I’m a big believer in—you could have multiple things going on and they can all carry equal weight. Okay? They’re—they all—right? So you have all this going on and it is, in fact, overwhelming. And… and if you’ve got kids, you’re already fucking tired. And so—  [Laughs.]  So—  [James laughs.]  —you’ve been home with them for many months! Uh, and so the idea of… Netflixing and just wanting to not be part of it. When the Me Too movement was at its peak, that was a very easy place for me to feel very connected as a victim of assault and as a woman. And so it was… easy for me to know when I needed to step out and let somebody else speak for me because I couldn’t do it anymore. And then… to step up when somebody else needed me to step up so they could take a step back. ‘K? And I feel like in… this situation… which I am a step away from—you wanna speak up. And you wanna teach… your kids to speak up. james Mm-hm. biz I do not also want to look like a complete asshole— james Mm-hm! biz Who’s like—Dear Black People, I don’t understand, but I understand. Right? Like—  [Laughs.] crosstalk James : Yeah! Totally! Yeah! Well—  Biz : Like—I don’t—like— biz I feel like that makes me look… like, not helpful? james But—but actually you know what? I kind of want to challenge something that I don’t—and again, like, this is just me. crosstalk James : Um, and my opinion.  Biz : And this is just me! james This is just me and my opinion and my idea. Um, I’m okay with, y’know, I think—uh—don’t be afraid of looking like an asshole. Because if that prevents you from doing anything, I—I think—once—someone will let you know that you’ve stepped out of line. Right?  [Biz laughs.]  And, oop! Okay. Sorry. And now I know where that boundary is. Right? And then if you don’t have someone in your life—what I’m talking about—a black person to let you know that you’ve stepped out of line?  [Biz laughs.]  Then there’s your first  [through laughter]  thing to do!  [Biz laughs.]  You need to go do some outreach so you have those people in your life that can help you, um, ‘cause everybody benefits from diversity. Just having—it helps you in that sort of situation. So I—I think, like, um, and that’s why I just say it—grace has been my theme and motto for this—since the pandemic started. Because I think—and just in general, as human beings, it’s gotta be messy. You’re gonna step on toes. It’s kind of like—a dance. And we have to learn how to do this dance with each other and that every person that you’re dancing with, too, and you’re working with someone on an issue or talking with someone or engaging with them, they’re all gonna be different. So you just have to check in with them about—oop! Oop! Where am I dancing with you on this one, too? And I think, too, y’know… I think everyone has to find their activism. I think we all have to… be activists. In the same way that everybody needs to be a feminist. Like, being a feminist is about believing in—that women are equal! And working and striving towards that! And making mistakes and getting back up and, y’know, moving where the movement sort of goes. And I think activism has to be—and it can take so many different forms. It can, um, y’know—being with your children and talking to them! That’s activism! If it’s taking to the streets; if it’s donating; if it’s, y’know, being involved in social media. Having conversations with people in your circle is one of the most important ones? And I think it’s okay to be—I think sometimes we—we’re—we love being so comfortable. I mean, we have—Netflix and chill, right? We love being comfortable and we have— biz Yes! James! I love being comfortable!  [Laughs.] james It’s—of course! It’s cozy! Let’s be in our cave and hibernate. Let me put on the onesie and let’s hang out. biz Yes! Just… yes!  [Laughs.] james But being comfortable is how we got here and if we, y’know, I guess my biggest fear and why I say I’m cautiously optimistic—is that we have all this—the anger and the sadness and this frustration and the minute the news cycle changes to something else and we’re not seeing these images and we’re not, uh, we have very short attention spans. And so—hold onto this feeling. You know? Put it away. Journal it or something. And that’s why I say it has to be a daily commitment. And pushing yourself to your uncomfortable limits. It’s okay to be uncomfortable. It’s okay to have these uncomfortable conversations, because it’s like—I’ve  [through laughter]  not experienced this, but giving birth. I imagine it’s one of the most painful things that you—  [Biz laughs.]  —people have ever done. Or like, when you go through like—we’re going through major surgery right now. And painful. And it’s—we can’t shy away from that pain. We have to dig even deeper. ‘Cause you know what? I—it’s gotta get worse. It will. But—for the better. Right? Digging deep and—and—yeah. biz Well I think the surgery… comparison… is an interesting one because when you’ve had major surgery, uh, in theory there should be a recovery time. Something Americans are not very good at is recovering anymore. We will get you right out—oh, did you just have a baby? Goodbye! Go back to work! Right? james Yeah! Oh my gosh, yeah! biz Like, or did you just have open-heart surgery? Well you get to be here for three days. Now get out! So I—I think… I think you’re convincing me that parenting is going to be helpful.  [Laughs.] james So helpful! Oh my gosh! biz Because I think when the news cycle switches… and our focus goes somewhere else… if we are still—as parents—having the conversations. Making sure that our… y’know… the books we have in our house reflect diversity. Have, y’know, that the kid shows we’re choosing to watch, activities we sign up for. And I—and I understand that for… I have always grown up in very diverse communities. Okay? I mean, hello. I’m from Alabama. Um—and—  [Laughs.] [James laughs.]  That is… diverse! It freaks me out when I go to cities. I remember the first time I ever went to like some city in Maine and like I’m walking around and I kept thinking—I cannot put my finger on what is weird about this. Something is really weird. And then like ten minutes later I was like, oh my god, there’s  [through laughter]  no black people here! And— james It’s startling!  [Laughs.] biz It is startling! james [Through laughter]  And it should be startling for people! biz But it should—well, it should be. And I think—but I think, though, that it’s very… it is a comfortable place—speaking of comfort!—for me here in California or when I was home in Alabama or when I lived in New York or Atlanta or any of these places that I am very used to seeing diversity around me all the time. james Right. biz That has afforded me a sensation of… not being scared of—of people. james Yeah! Yeah! Right! biz I am not—  [Laughs.]  Like, I’m not! That’s never crossed my mind! Right? And so… then I realized that that is not the case for people… all over our country. Where they do not live in diverse communities. And so… while it’s very easy for me to say—go find a diverse Girl Scout troop in your neighborhood—  [James laughs.]  When that’s not an option, I think what you were saying about the TV shows; uh, making sure you’re listening to programming—whether it be podcasts or radio or music—music is something that I—we love music in our house? And I—it really is one of the easiest ways to start talking about it? Like, oh! Do you—do you like this, uh, singer? We were listening to like Miles Davis and I was like, oh, do you—do you like this? This is great! Fun fact—  [Laughs.] [James laughs.]  When he was recording this, he wasn’t allowed into a building through the same door. Right? james I love it! biz And it was like— crosstalk Biz : It was really simple! Yeah!  James : But just that history! james And that’s what I was gonna say is that you can dive—music is such a great, y’know, not just the surface-level things but diving even deeper to the history of it? I love that you do that? Because it’s also like—y’know, we can’t just look at the… uh, the symptoms of the things that are happening. We have to look at the cause. Right? If I’m bleeding, we don’t just go, like, oh, you’re bleeding! We, like, oh, what happened! Oh, someone punched me in the face. Like, that’s—now we’re looking at—  [Biz laughs.]  —well, why did this happen? Y’know? Oh, ‘cause they’re racists. Oh. Why are they racists? Because they’re afraid. Now we start unpacking, right? You just kinda keep… digging until it’s literally the roots are rotten. We have rotten roots in this country. Y’know? They—talking of going to the police; they talk about one bad apple. Well that apple orchard—it’s—it’s full of rotten roots so we need to, y’know, get at the root of things— crosstalk James : —and—and—and clear that out.  Biz : Yeah. It’s hard to be a healthy— biz —apple if the tree itself is infected. Right? Like, if we are gonna do… an apple—  [Laughs.]  Metaphor.  [Laughs.] james Yeah! I—let’s go with it. biz You’re right! If the tree itself is—y’know—is—is bad, then—then we gotta—y’know. Johnny Appleseed that shit, like, in different ways. Right? james Yeah. biz I do think we should come up with some examples. Like, what are these smaller ways? Because it’s easy to say— crosstalk Biz : Y’know.  James : In the big, abstract… yeah. biz Right! It is abstract! So I—let’s—let’s kind of… delve into some ways that can be… helpful through our—maybe our own experiences. I mean, like, if you— what were some things that like your folks, uh, or that friends of yours or you’ve seen other parents doing that you’re like, oh! That’s not a bad idea! That—that works! james Or even, like, my fantasy wish list for when I like have a—my children? It’s like, I’m gonna, um, I’m going to adopt two and have one. I have this theory—  [Biz laughs.]  —for every—‘cause like there’s all these—‘cause I’m gay, I don’t have to biologically have children, y’know? But I want one. Just to see—like, I wanna create something and see what it would look like, y’know?  [Biz laughs.]  There’s just that? But I have to go adopt some children. And what if I need a bone marrow transplant? So. Y’know.  [Laughs.] biz Yeah. I know. Selfish, selfish. crosstalk Biz : Anyway. Now you—  James : Gotta think about it! biz Now you know why we are all having children!  [Laughs.] [James laughs.] james You just have—they’re just walking donors. crosstalk James : Just walking donors.  Biz : Yeah. Donors everywhere.  [Laughs.] james Keep a liver good, little child! Alright. Um… yeah! So I think—again—I think one of the first things—I think what we were just talk—trying to itemize, uh, these things, y’know. First, checking in with yourself. Um, and—and broadening your resources. Like you said, or just going towards, y’know, uh… uh… non-white media of all different facets and sources. And sometimes that doesn’t even have to be, like, when we get to, like, books for your kids? Sometimes—like, it doesn’t all have to be, like, oooh! The struggle! crosstalk James : Sometimes it can be just—  Biz : Well right! Yeah!  [Laughs.] james —a protagonist that happens to be a non-white dude! Like, that’s also helpful!  [Laughs.] biz One of our favorite—‘cause I do like to do shoutouts to people who are doing good work—uh, OurShelves? We’ve had them on a couple of times? They’re a book club for kids and they just send books featuring diverse people! In them. james Yeah. And I think when we’re looking at—what I love about that is that like, y’know, I—we—like—our children aren’t gonna be exposed to this no matter what? And so it’s sort of like getting… y’know… we’re just—I… I don’t wanna open up this can of worms. biz Ooooh! james I was gonna say—it’s sort of like, y’know, you get your shots when you go to the doctor! Y’know?  [Laughs.]  Um— biz We like shots.  [Laughs.]  On this— james [Through laughter]  Okay! biz This show—this show, we’ve been pretty clear on this show about a lot of things. Alright? And one of those things is—the shots. james But yeah! You want your children to be, y’know, strong and immune—like, get their immunity to, uh, what’s going on so you give them a little bit of these dosages of—of reality, essentially, and it equips them. And, um, so I think like that. Like, continue doing, like, having conversations—then having conversations with your children and remember it’s an ongoing conversation? And then also, too? Expanding that then towards your community? Um, having conversations with the people in your, uh, social network? Like, sometimes you gotta put out fires on social media. We gotta, like, let this, y’know… we gotta nip it in the bud. And it doesn’t mean that you—at least challenge it—you don’t have to spend all of your day on social media? But use your platform for good! It doesn’t have to be—people vote with your—their dollars, too. And when I see people who, y’know, I follow on social media who are standing up and saying something? It makes me want to continue following them. When I see that they’re not? I’m like, girl, bye. I don’t have time. Y’know? Um, and something, too, like, I—I just—this is a bit of a tangent or a derail, as we say here— biz I like it! james Uh, let’s go off the rails! But like when—hashtag #BlackoutTuesday—once everybody figured out what the fuck we were supposed to be doing with it—  [Biz laughs.]  —there’s a lot of confusion! We’ve learned about how algorithms work and why we use hashtags? It was a learning lesson for all of us?  [Laughs.] biz I was like, ohhh! james What—I’m doing it wrong! crosstalk Biz : What is happening?!  James : And here’s— james Here’s what I love about it? Is we adjusted. We made a mistake—like, let’s be okay with we’re gonna make mistakes and we adjust. But we don’t take it personally. And like, oh, my feelings are hurt or I did it wrong; I give up. It’s like, whoops! Sorry. Made a mistake. Let’s recalibrate. Right? And by the end of that day, I—my feed was filled with either a black square so then all I saw was black excellence? Like, stories about uplifting black people? Black history, um, things—action items I could be doing, that people could be doing. It was just—wow. And so to continue doing those, um, doing those things? Your workplace—I want to give snaps to my part-time, uh, job—I work in the tech industry and it’s not a shitshow? Um—  [Biz laughs.]  My CEO is a black woman, which is like—and it makes— biz What?! james I know! crosstalk James : In the tech industry!  Biz : Is this Narnia? biz Are we in Narnia?  [Laughs.] james Am I in the upside-down world? crosstalk James : Like, what’s going on?!  Biz : Where are we?!  [Laughs.] james Um, but they—like, we’ve created these town halls where we’re speaking about these issues. And especially for those of us who are—a lot of people are—like, 25% of the country’s working from home. So, like… our home lives and our real lives are blurring so much. And when I saw I feel seen, now I know that my colleagues know that when I’m coming into a meeting I’m coming in with all of my black queerness experience. biz All of this. james And just ‘cause I’m able to sometimes, y’know, smile or I’m able to… um… y’know… any success I have isn’t because there’s not an unjust system; it’s because I’ve pushed through  [through laughter]  this unjust system. Y’know? And so I think, um… I think gone are the days where talking about like race and sexism and homophobia as taboo subjects at work? No! We are humans, right? Like… there’s no such thing as identity politics! My identity informs my politics. It informs—  [Biz laughs.]  —my life! So I think it’s okay for creating—like we do with our children, making it so that it’s not taboo and that we can have these conversations. ‘Cause when we shine a light on these things they’re not done in the dark, right? And we—people are then able to make, y’know, mistakes and we can say, op, nope, we don’t say that. Or we’re not doing that. Um, and also, too, there are groups for white people specifically to talk about racism. And— biz Yes! That’s why we don’t actually have to… crosstalk James : Come to us?  [Laughs.] Biz : Ask every person— biz —that we see on the street. But—but, y’know. Let’s all be careful that we—  [Laughs.] james Go to the right group. crosstalk James : ‘Cause there’s some groups where it’s a bunch of—  Biz : Go to the right group. Yeah.  [Laughs.] james —white people getting around and they’re talking about race and so, just be careful which group you’re in. When they start putting on a hood you know you’re in the wrong place. Right?  [Laughs.] biz Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s—yeah. Make sure—whoa! Yeah. Do your research, guys!  [James laughs.]  That could be really tricky! Yeah. james Yes. And I think just knowing that it is a… a—a process and again I think it just goes back to making that commitment that I really do believe that we can—before, y’know, we take our last breath, which will be like 150 years from now? I’m wishing that for us ‘cause we’re gonna have that? We’re taking care of ourselves. Um, that we’re gonna look back and be like, man, wasn’t that crazy? That, like, police used to kill people! Like, they don’t have to! There’s a—signs of it in other countries where that just doesn’t happen. And so, um, y’know—and—and even taking your children—you could—taking them to a protest, depending on what, y’know, their ages? And y’know, doing it during the day. Like, we don’t need to shield them from this ‘cause who do we want our children to be? We want them to be leaders in this world! We want them to be making the world a better place and if they’re silent; if they’re passive; if they’re, um, complacent; if they’re participating in any of this, y’know, systemic racism then that’s—I know that no parent wants that. Um, and so I think on the flip—on the end of this, it’s always sort of giving your children that sense of hope. That yes, there are these bad things that are happening and this is what they are; um, I’m gonna protect—I’m going to, uh, make you—make sure that you’re gonna be living in a safe environment. But um, we in this family make a commitment to—to ending this. And—and we’re going to. Because we believe in love and equality and equity for all. biz Growing up where I grew up? In my time? I can remember having those thoughts as like a, y’know, teen. That this is gonna be done. By the time I have kids? This will be done. And it’s not. And… it… it’s—and—y’know, there are a million reasons as to why it’s not. And it would be very easy for me to say on the pessimistic side of—how the fuck is this supposed to happen? But—that said—I see, y’know, what’s different is that the crowds that are marching and that are protesting, it is filled with… the kids of—I mean, I had my kids late. So I mean—  [James laughs.]  —like, the kids of my generation, like, they—that I grew up with—those kids are out marching. And speaking. Because to them… it does make total sense. james Yeah. biz That this is wrong. james Yeah! Yeah. And I think—I mean, we—like—change can be… incremental? And I think tons of people get frustrated with it and, y’know, sometimes I believe, y’know, I’m fighting for a future I will never see? Just because the folks that came before me did that? And I think that, um, everyone has their role to play. Like, even to our listeners that—your listeners out there who, y’know, are—are… um… who are black! Um, I know how exhausted and tired and frustrated you are. And so I say—and—and to know, for people who are not black? Like, know that they’re tired and frustrated and exhausted. And so to allow—give that space? And so to give yourself that space, too. And… take your breather. But also, like… we also have the work to do as well. And in—what I—and what I mean by that is that something that’s been helpful for me is finding someone in history that has—can be my guiding light. My spirit guide. And for me it’s been Harriet Tubman. Because— biz Ooh! Yeah. james —she—if you haven’t seen that movie,  Harriet ? It’s so phenomenal. Please watch it. It is amazing. I\\xa0mean, this woman, like, freed herself and then came back and freed hundreds of people. Never lost a soul. And then was a spy for the Union Army! And so then, even for myself as like, oh, man, it’s so challenging, y’know, being black in this, y’know, racist country—but then I’m like—  [Biz laughs.]  —well, I have Netflix. Right? Like, I have an air conditioning house. Like, she did so much for me. So again, like, I—I encourage like—especially ‘cause of the generational trauma is real for black folks and then the trauma that you’re experiencing now? So I wanna be aware of that, but just to—I also, y’know… find that strength to—to—to find your inner Harriet Tubman.  [Laughs.]  Is what I’m saying.  [Laughs.] biz Oh, god, yes. Yes! No, I think that’s very fair. And I—I think—yeah. I—yes. Yes! Yes. Watch me say yes. james Yasssss!  [Laughs.] biz It sounds like something that you keep hitting on in the steps that we can take is… forgiveness and patience. james Mm-hm. biz And so I—I just wanna wrap up in saying… thank you for… bringing your grace?  [Laughs.]  That you are giving yourself? Onto the show. And for all of us… if you are afraid to step forward to speak up because you’re scared you’re going to step in it? As the queen of stepping in it on this show? Very often? The thing that we can continue to do besides all of that work—when we are taking a look at ourselves—is looking at the beauty of learning? james Mm. biz And… apologizing when—even if your intent was not to harm? I don’t mean, like, just running around—sorry!  [James laughs.] [Through laughter]  I mean, like—like, we all have kids. We all know when we’ve said to our kids—that is not a real apology. Right? Like—you’ve gotta make eye contact when you do it. But… really taking an opportunity if we step in it, um, to say… oooh. That—that was not my intention. james But keep on stepping, right? crosstalk James : Like, you said that in the very beginning of this show!  Biz : But keep on stepping! Yes! james And like—I love that you said—I know you’re trying to wrap it up here, but you just get me talking. But like the—I love the forgiveness and patience and activation. Like, it’s just, y’know, staying active and—I think you said it just so wonderfully in the beginning of this show, like, we just have to keep on stepping even if it’s small steps or big steps. We just keep on… trip-tropping along. Keep going. biz I know. Trip-trap-trip-trap—it’s like my mother, who always said—two steps forward. One step back. Two steps forward. One step back. And those backsteps fucking suck. james Yeah. biz But! The new steps… are—hopefully are going to be wonderful. I just—I just hate that we are still here, James. But I am glad that you are here with me. And I’m glad to have you here. james Yay! biz And I will continue to ask questions. And… try and take the right steps and I appreciate you being lovely enough to speak with us here. Everybody? Keep stepping! james Yeah!

You can share some of your own by calling 206-350-9485. That’s 206-350-9485. biz Genius fail time, James. Genius me! clip [Dramatic, swelling music in background.] Biz:  Wow! Oh my God! Oh my God! I saw what you did! Oh my God! I’m paying attention! Wow! You, mom, are a genius. Oh my God, that’s fucking genius!  [Biz and Theresa repeatedly affirm each other as they discuss their respective genius moments of the week.] james My genius was… that… I… volunteered at work to facilitate a discussion around racism! And what’s going on! I—  [Biz laughs.]  Yeah. I—I stepped up and volunteered and I helped to lead a discussion. I was grateful that it happened. And that I… um, sometimes have been wanting to withdraw ‘cause I am sad and I’m heavy and I’m hurt? And I’m finding my ways to… uh… push forward and stay active and engaged in my—in—in the way that I—the way that I can! biz That is, in fact, genius!  [James laughs.]  I—I had backup peanut butter on hand. I’m just kidding!  [Laughs.] [James laughs.] crosstalk Biz [Through laughter]  I’m sorry!  James : Hey, we all— james You know, we all have our geniuses in our own way. crosstalk James : My—don’t compete. Be unique. Um—  [Laughs.] Biz : No, no. No, no. I—  [Laughs.] james Gonna try to self-help you! biz I know you’re not being amazing at me, James.  [Laughs.] [James laughs.] james Oh my god, I love that!  [Laughs.] biz Oh, alright. So, yes. You are, in fact, doing an amazing job and once again—thank you! james Yay! biz For doing that! Just because I wanna continue to be a really great person, I am having these discussions with my kids. Uh, right now. Very specifically, I would love to keep my kids from having to know about any of this. I—y’know—it—it is… they are hard discussion. And they’re different. Katy Belle’s ten; Ellis is six. However, Ellis’s whole kindergarten class was about being, uh, citizens of the world. And they were already talk—I mean, sometimes—  [Laughs.] james Oh my god! biz Ellis would, like, Ellis would like bust out on me sometimes where he’s like—  [Laughs.]  Like, Katy Belle will be like—you can’t do that. You’re too young.  [James laughs.]  “Age is not a limitation. To what I can or can’t do.” And I’m like, what the fuck  [voice becomes high-pitched]  is happening? crosstalk James : Yes! I love that! That gives me such hope! That’s insane! Oh, I love it.  Biz : So, y’know. My—oh, I know. I know. I know. They’re— biz They are good kids. But like… it’s a hard work and I am doing it and… it—I have to do it and we all have to do it and so I hope that’s really everybody’s genius this week. And every week going forward. There ya go. james Yeah! caller [Answering machine beeps.]  Hi! I’m calling in with a genius. I… have been running out of pandemic activities to keep my four-and-a-half-year-old occupied. Um, she loves being in water. She loves playing in water. We live in a small apartment. We do not have a backyard. We do not have  [through laughter]  a pool. Um… there’s only so long she can stay in the bathtub. Um, because she has eczema! So… I realized that I could put out a little tub of water and all of those—we do have, like, a tiny little, um, balcony so if I just—all of those toys that were sitting out there getting dirty that she’s been asking me to clean—  [Biz laughs.]  —that I haven’t had time to clean? I realized I could just squirt some dish soap into the tub and pour some water in and throw all those dirty toys in there for her to clean herself! Gave her a scrub brush and she went at it happily! Playing in the water and cleaning her own toys. Now, she is… inside. Happily scrubbing away at the dirty dishes. In the sink. And having a grand ol’ time at it. And I… am sitting down—  [Biz laughs.]  —having a cup of tea. Calling you. Feeling like I’ve just unlocked some secret parenting badge. I don’t know how long this is gonna last for? But… I’m going to enjoy it  [through laughter]  while it’s happening. Thank you so much for everything that you—Biz and Theresa—you do for us. Um, you’re both doing an amazing job. Thanks again! Bye. biz Alright. You are doing… a very good job. Sadly? Children cleaning dishes will not last past—  [James laughs.]  —into the tween years. Sadly. They’ll start asking for money. But what you’ve done right now is you have really turned that—I like to call it, the, like, Cinderella/Sleeping Beauty knob? Where it’s like,  [singing]  Work is fuuunnn! Work is fun!  [Laughs.] james Yeah! crosstalk James : That’s so—that’s brilliant!  Biz [Through laughter]  I get to do work!  [Laughs.] james I’m taking notes. For when I get my adopt—my two adopted children and the one that I have. Like, that’s exactly what they’re doing. And then they’ll just be conditioned to the work and it’s not total— biz Yes! Conditioned! james Later we’ll have to spin this somehow… um… yeah. biz James?  [James laughs.]  So much is about spinning and bribery. So much. And—yeah. I also just really love the idea of whoever’s in the balcony below in the apartment? crosstalk James : Yes. Yes. It’s just a great image!  [Laughs.] Biz : Just getting that water? biz Just getting that water. You are doing a very good job. And we are all trapped inside. You are doing wonderful! Good job! Failures! clip [Dramatic orchestral music plays in the background.] Theresa [In a voice akin to the Wicked Witch of the West]  Fail. Fail. Fail. FAIL!  [Timpani with foot pedal engaged for humorous effect.] Biz: [Calmly]  You suck!  [Biz and Theresa repeatedly affirm each other as they discuss their respective failures of the week.] biz Fail me, James.  [Laughs.] james Okay. Yeah. This is great. ‘Cause I don’t want everybody—everyone’s like, oh, James, he’s, y’know, so perfect. I’m not! Um— biz Yes, we are. Dreamy James is perfect. james At first I was gonna give—I don’t—was gonna give, um—at first my failure was gonna be, like, oh, I—y’know, I’ve not been going out to the protests and I feel like I’m not doing enough. But then I went with my—going back to my genius I did with what I—I could. So then my actual failure has just been, like, it’s not—it’s just something that I’m not doing in general? Listen. I said I’m a One Bad Guncle and that—I mean that. Um, I have… I don’t really know how many nephews and nieces? One of—my stepbrother just keeps having kids. I can’t keep track.  [Biz laughs.]  I couldn’t pick them out of a lineup. I—I know some of—that there’s—some names and I can maybe put them to? Um, I have one nephew that I adore—little Theo—uh, he’s just the world. But I have all these other ones that I just like—  [Biz laughs.]  —I have one that’s like 18. I think—he’s not gonna listen to this. He’s a little shit. Um— biz Yeah. No. james And you know what? This is where my failure is—I don’t like him. And—  [Biz laughs.]  —my failure is—I’m putting this out on blast? I just don’t! He’s just ungrateful. Um, all I can do is just, y’know, hope for the best for him that he finds his way, but he’s a little ungrateful shit. So I’m— biz 18-year-olds sometimes are.  [Laughs.] james I’ve—I’m not a good uncle. Because I think he’s—  [Biz laughs.]  I’m—I wanna just tell people, I don’t like him!  [Laughs.] biz Yeah. Yeah. No, you’re doing a horrible, horrible job. Of being a Gruncle! Wow! Wow! crosstalk James : And listen—his birthday’s coming up? I’m not gonna wish him a happy birthday! Nothing! No!  Biz : Not gonna send—shit!  [Laughs.] james Nuh-uh! Not gonna—nothing! And I’m gonna—I’m gonna know it’s his birthday and know I’m not doing a damn thing. You know what I’m gonna do? Do something for myself. So. crosstalk Biz : Oh, good! Good! Spend that money on yourself!  James : Yeah!  [Laughs.] biz That’s right! I… once was a person who was on top of things. Uh, I… was very good at many, many things. Including—I thought reading an email! In fact, I am one of those smug people who were like, I know you’re not gonna read this but I’m gonna put information in it.  [James laughs.]  Right? Like, I’m like a smug email writer. And the kids are signed up to do online art camp. james Yeah. biz See how that works, guys. james Okay. Yeah. biz And I’m supposed to pick up some art supplies. And… I have read the email. Multiple times. So Wednesday I went by the school to pick them up. No one knew what the hell I was talking about. So I said, oh, no. No, no. It says—it says I’m supposed to pick it up! So I reopen the email and I say—oh! Tomorrow. Today’s not Thursday. It’s Wednesday. It’s-that’s me! Haha! And I leave.  [James laughs.]  And then today… yesterday I couldn’t go back to pick them up so I was like, oh, Friday. I gotta go pick—so I go. And… they’re—they’re still not there. And I look at the email and—and—I’m not even supposed to pick them up at that school! It’s definitely—it’s some other location. james Oh! biz And I don’t… like… like, with such confidence! I thought this was supposed to be what I was doing. And I don’t wanna go to that other location! That other location is not near me.  [Laughs.]  It’s not—  [James laughs.]  It’s not close. Y’know? Like, being out in the world is very stressful. crosstalk James : Yes! Oh my gosh!  Biz : Uh, y’know. And so— biz It is—I’m gonna still—I’m gonna make a third trip tomorrow. To go pick up… these dumb art supplies. james Wow. biz And they better be worth it! They—there better be some things that I don’t have laying around this house. In those bags. That’s—yeah. james If it’s just some crayons and some chalk— biz If it is?  [Laughs.] james —heads are gonna roll, school system! biz I’m just gonna—that is right! Unaffiliated summer camp! caller [Answering machine beeps.]  Hey,  One Bad Mother ! I’m calling with a fail. I’m actually driving home from my fail as we speak. Uh… so this is an outdoor mishap. We were… going out for a walk. It’s the first walk that I’ve managed to convince my two-and-a-half-year-old to take with me, like, for five days. Uh, I was just really itching to get out. I was like, you know it’s finally nice outside. So I took her out for a walk to this place with a pond. We’re walking around the pond. She wants to throw rocks in the pond. She’s done this before. It’s been fine. I give her rocks to throw. Um, she walks up to the edge of the pond and just falls right in. And this was like… the dirtiest, scuzziest, nastiest pond?  [Biz laughs.]  Like, you can see all the algae and guck and grossness just all over it?  [Laughs.] [Biz laughs.]  So she’s just immediately covered. Her hair is covered. She’s screaming. She’s pissed off. And… I pull her out. Now I’m covered.  [James laughs.]  And this is basically my kid’s worst nightmare because she’s like one of those “don’t get dirt on me ever” kids.  [Biz laughs.]  And so I have to race her back to the stroller, which is now also covered in pond water. And, uh, take her back to the car seat, which is also now covered in pond water.  [Biz laughs.]  And now we’re going to spend the rest of the morning getting a bath and changing clothes and not going on the walk that I wanted to go on.  [James laughs.]  And hopefully she’ll go on it again with me sometime, but we’ll see. She tends to hold on to negative memories about a place, so. Hooray!  [Laughs.]  Yeah. That’s my fail. I hope you guys are all doing better than me today.  [James laughs.]  Thank you. Bye. biz Yeah. No. That’s—that’s—that’s horrible. You’ve done a horrible job. You’re—you’re—A—why would you even go outside? That’s such—that— crosstalk Biz : How grandiose! Grandi—  [Laughs.]  Yeah. That’s right. That’s right!  James : Also, a bad start from the get-go. It’s a pandemic.  [Laughs.] biz That’s right. You—we are teaching our children to be scared inside as much as possible. And—and I guess—so I guess on some levels you’ve taught them that the outside world is a dangerous, horrible place. james Scary place.  [Laughs.] biz Yeah! And… yeah! Just… I… yeah! Why would you try and do anything nice like that? That’s… crazy. On the plus side—your child will never throw stones! Ohhh! james There ya go! Ooooh! crosstalk Biz : Thanks! Thank you!  James : Love—well done! biz You’re actually doing a really wonderful job. But at the same time, don’t ever leave your house again. music “Mom Song” by Adira Amram. Mellow piano music with lyrics.

Griffin McElroy:  Embedded in each episode of  My Brother, My Brother and Me  is a micro-clue that will lead you to 14 precious gemstones, all around this big, beautiful blue world of ours.  Travis McElroy : So start combing through the episodes—eh, let’s say—starting at episode 101 on.  Griffin : Yeah, the early episodes are pretty problematic, so there’s no clues in those episodes.  Travis : No. No, not at all.  Griffin : The better ones—the good ones? Clues ahoy.  Justin McElroy : Listen to every episode repeatedly in sequence. Laugh if you must, but mainly, get all the great clues.  My Brother, My Brother and Me : it’s an advice show, kind of, but a treasure hunt, mainly.

It's I, John Hodgman of the  Judge John Hodgman  podcast.  Elliott Kalan:  And I, Elliott Kalan of the  Flop House  podcast.  John:  And we've made a whole new podcast! A 12-episode special miniseries called  I, Podius . In which we recap, discuss, and explore the very famous 1976 BBC miniseries about Ancient Rome called  I, Claudius ! We've got incredible guests such as Gillian Jacobs, Paul F. Tompkins, as well as star of  I, Claudius  Sir Patrick Stewart! And his son! Non-Sir Daniel Stewart.  Elliott:  Don't worry, Dan, you'll get there someday.  John: I, Podius  is the name of the show! Every week from  MaximumFun.org  for only 12 weeks. Get 'em at  MaximumFun.org , or wherever you get your podcasts.  [Music fades out.] biz So guys… seems like the new format of the show for a little while is going to be me having the, uh… delightful honor of speaking to great people. More of a… guest weekend than just a guest moment like we usually do. And normally at this time, I would say that we always have somebody special on every week and that’s, uh, a mom having a breakdown. But… as I have given this week, uh, a great deal of thought—usually, guys, we record on Mondays. And it’s like the start of the week. And now I am recording on Fridays and… that really—I have found—puts quite a different lens on the show and where I am when I come into the show. And I just feel like… the entire country is having a collective breakdown. At the moment. And… so… instead of… listening to a call this week, I’m just gonna go straight to how we wrap it up on this show. Because I think we all need to hear that this week. What did we learn this week, James? This week… well… there’s the blatantly obvious things we have learned. james [Laughs.]  Yeah. We learned that— biz Racism? Bad!  [Laughs.] james Racism—bad. crosstalk James : It’s still here.  Biz : Racism, bad. Yeah. Still here! james Still here! And that like I think we learned like what we all now need to do. Like, there’s an awakening in that, y’know, being anti-racist and being an activist are necessary commitments that we have to commit to! biz Yeah. If you—I mean, it is… no different than any of the other difficult conversations that we will have to have with our children. We cannot avoid talking about death with our children. We cannot avoid talking about sex with our children. We cannot avoid… talking about… inequality in our country with our children. Because it’s there. james Yeah. biz Guys? It is incredibly hard right now. We always say on this show—we never know what’s going on in somebody else’s life. And as parents we have usually honed in on that when it comes to the mom having the breakdown at Target. The kid screaming on the bus. The woman crossing the street with all the groceries and five kids. Before we assume the worst, we should assume the best because… we don’t know what’s going on at home. We do not know if—I think about that—as silly as that call was with that—the genius with the mom and the water and the tub, how easy it is when people… come out and say—I’m struggling with something. My kid likes—how do I pass the time? Well, aren’t I helpful! Let me give you all the things that are totally fine without taking into account that your child might have eczema. There might be a fear of water. There might be, y’know, not the space available to do the things that I have the space available to do. This is exactly… like… this larger… context that we find ourselves in now. We cannot continue to make assumptions about people. We need to check our assumptions before we pass judgment. james Mm. biz What we should be walking out there with is the idea that we are all trying our best and we all want the best for our children? And we all want our children to be… safe. Okay? That said? We are not experiencing this world the same. And… that is something we need to—to say to ourselves and to say to each other. james Mm-hm. biz Okay? Many things can be happening at the same time. I can completely acknowledge that, uh, people of color are walking through this world differently than me. james Mm-hm. biz I am—I am concerned every time my child goes outside of the house but god, it is not the same. My kid can wear a hoodie. ‘K? My kid can go birdwatching. My kid can do fucking anything that they want on some level because of the color of their skin and I think that is unbearable that someone else doesn’t have that same privilege. You are all… doing this under a pandemic? And you’re all doing this with kids in your house. And like, under normal circumstances, James, I can sit here and tell, like, our listeners—god! You’re tired.  [Laughs.] james Mm-hm. biz God! Somebody is touching you all fucking day and it’s too much.  [James laughs.]  Somebody’s talking to you all day and it is too much. You are trying to do all of your jobs and your work and there are children there. And they don’t care. james Right. biz And, y’know, there’s guilt. And there’s stress. And there’s tired. And there’s worry. And there’s fear and there’s no sleep and there are babies screaming all night long and there is poop in the bathtub and no one cares that you got your kid to sleep last night. All of this—all of this is a big old soup that we are living in right now? And I encourage us to go out and continue to… not be a jerk. james Mm-hm. biz Don’t assume anybody is—I know that James is not being a better person at me. He just is.  [James laughs.]  ‘K? Um… those people who are able to protest and are able to be out there and are able to speak up are not doing it at you? And we really have an opportunity when we feel like there’s nothing for us to do. When the times are dark and scary. I—I… think that James has helped remind us that we do have something we can do. We can teach our children to go out… and be better. James? Thank you so much. For joining us. A good place that everyone can start is going and listening to  Minority Korner james Yesss! biz Because they are having these discussions—  [James laughs.]  —they’ve been having these discussions! james For years!  [Laughs.] biz Um—yeah! I mean… y’know. So go and check that out. That will be a good resource for where to go next. james Yeah! biz Okay? james Thank you for having me! This has been such a delight. I’ve enjoyed this conversation so much and I just also want to—I encourage—like, thank you for the work that you’re doing. And the other parents. The other listeners. I know you’ve got a—there’s a great community here at MaxFun. And so I—like, everybody just keep going. Keep going. Keep going. We can do this. We will do this. Uh, your children are gong to also do this. Um, and just to keep going! Keep going. Keep going. Breathe. Dance. Keep going. So thank you! biz That’s right. Theresa? Wherever you are and I’m pretty sure it’s the sixth level of Hell, I know that you are doing a very good job. Uh, we see you. Uh… and… I’ve got your back. As long as you need it. Um… James? You are doing a very good job. You are… doing more than you have to do and I—I really appreciate it. james Mm. biz Everybody? We are going to continue to be here. We will talk to you next week. Byeee! james Bye, y’all! music “Mama Blues” by Cornbread Ted and the Butterbeans.

       "'sound effect [Three gavel bangs.] monte belmonte Welcome to the  Judge John Hodgman  podcast. I\\'m summertime... less fun-time guest bailiff, Monte Belmonte, filling in for the actual bailiff, Jesse Thorn. We are in chambers this week to clear the docket! And now, the Webby Award–winning host of the  Judge John Hodgman  podcast, Judge John Hodgman. What a thrill it was, Judge John Hodgman, when you included me in that Tweet!  [John chuckles.]  To tell me that this podcast had won a Webby! And then I go online and watch the Zoom Webby Awards, and there is none other than Monica Lewinsky giving you the award. john hodgman Yeah. monte It was really—it was fantastic. john Yeah, Monte, thank you. That—that I did not predict. I did not know that Monica Lewinsky would be... virtually presenting me with the Webby Award. But! The name of the show is  Judge John Hodgman , but as you know, Monte, there are a lot of people on Team  Judge John Hodgman . Obviously Bailiff Jesse Thorn, who can\\'t be with us today. Obviously you, Monte Belmonte, and Jean Grae, and all the other great guest bailiffs over time. Of course Jennifer Marmor. I can see you guys! We\\'re in this new era where— monte This is weird! john Yeah! Where we\\'re podcasting and we can see each other. We could have been doing this the whole time! monte I know! john But I see Monte. You\\'re up there in Northampton, Massachusetts. Well, Turners Falls, right? monte Right. It reminds me of when we would do this in the studios of WRSI. crosstalk Monte:  And could see each other.  John:  That\\'s right! We could see each other. monte And that was really fun. john And you\\'re sporting, I noticed, your Wagon Wheel T-shirt. The Wagon Wheel being a great, uh—a great drive-in restaurant and ice cream place up there in Gill, Massachusetts. How\\'s the Wagon Wheel doing, Monte? monte Doing takeout. Ice cream— john Doing takeout? monte Yep. john Yep. monte They\\'re figuring out how to do it as safely as they can. They weren\\'t one of the first adopters of the new model of eating out, but they have made that transition, and it\\'s going great. I—as far as I know. It\\'s too crowded for me to go there most of the time, so I guess that\\'s a good sign. john And you\\'re still broa—first of all, they make a very good black bean burger. Tell you that. monte Yes. And they make their excellent homemade ice cream. john Yeah, that\\'s right! And by the way, how are things up there at WRSI, the River? 93.9 The River, in Northampton? Are you still spinning the wheels of steel every morning, giving the news? monte I am! And it has become this strange dystopian future that I\\'ve read so much about— john Yeah. monte —in years previous, where I continue to wake up at two o\\'clock in the morning, continue to go in and do my show, and now people\\'s listening habits have changed— john Right. monte —and also, people have really made it well-known how important having this kind of communal... campfire of a radio— john Mm-hm. monte —how important that is to them in a time like this. And I\\'ve adapted to that, and changed the way that I do the show. I\\'m doing a lot more call-in/request–type stuff. I\\'ve developed these quaran-themes  (quaratine + themes) , like every day of the week, to help remind us what day of the week it is. As a— john Yeah, that\\'s the hard—that\\'s one of the hard ones. monte So it\\'s like Michigoss Monday, where I play like, a lot of Weird Al stuff! And then it\\'s like, Tear It Up Tuesday, a punk and soul dance party. And then like, it goes on from there, where... uh, it\\'s a gravitational force that I think people are used to, and usually our slogan is \"Different is Good,\" but we\\'ve kind of jokingly said— [laughs] —\"Same is Good!\" In the midst of all this, where it\\'s like, it gives people this sense of familiarity and community. john Right. Right. monte When they can\\'t have that in the same way that they\\'ve been experiencing it previously. john You don\\'t do weekends, right? You\\'re only Monday through Friday. monte Only when I have to. Yeah. john So you can\\'t do... Skaturday.  (Ska + Saturday.) monte Well— john The all-day ska programming. monte If you wanna do it with me on one of these days in the stay at home order, John Hodgman, I would do Skaturday with you. crosstalk John:  I\\'m—I\\'m afraid that—  Monte:  As somebody who went to go see the Mighty Might Bosstones at every opportunity I could at an under-18 show when I was a kid—  John:  Right.  Monte:  I—yeah. Let\\'s do it. john I\\'m afraid 24 hours of ska would push even Northampton over the edge. monte I think probably. john And there is Jennifer Marmor, super producer Jennifer Marmor up top, silent as always. Or are you—are you hooked up to your mic? I can\\'t remember now. monte She\\'s muted, I believe. john Nope, silent.  [John and Monte laugh.]  Purely muted. You\\'re wearing a lovely linen shirt you mentioned. And speaking of the news, of course, uh, we recorded this a week ago. This is coming out June 10th, 2020. And of course, a week ago we are in the midst of now several nights of coast-to-coast protests against police violence, specifically against people of color, specifically Black people, in this country and around the world. And, um, it\\'s upsetting. And we\\'re not gonna dwell on it dramatically in this episode. And who knows what the situation will look like when you actually hear the sound of our voices? But... I have been sharing a couple of links that you might find useful, and we\\'ll have links for them in the show page at  MaximumFun.org , and on the  Judge John Hodgman Instagram . One is—uh, I created a custom Bitlink for it, I didn\\'t make it up. It\\'s  Bit.ly/GETYOURFRIENDS . All capital letters, GETYOURFRIENDS. And that\\'s just a link to a  Rolling Stone  compilation of links to various—it\\'s a really—uh, I just happened to find it in  Rolling Stone , a really great collection of links to various bail funds, various local protestor support organizations, various policing reform organizations, including Reclaim the Block in Minneapolis, and they\\'re places that you can donate money to if you have the means to do so. And they also offer you lots of opportunities to support those organizations in other ways. It\\'s important that we all be part of this... struggle, one way or the other. And as well, another link that I\\'ve been handing out is a link to—on Medium, that came out a couple of years ago,  75 Things White People Can Do for Racial Justice . This was put up on Medium by Corinne Shutack. And it\\'s an incredibly thoughtful list about all sorts of—if you are a non–non-white person—that\\'s to say a white person—and you want to support, and get engaged, and be—and make anti-racism part of your life, lots and lots of concrete ideas of how—of books you can read, activism that you can train in, and organizations you can reach out to. And it\\'s a lot of valuable stuff. So that said, I just wanted to put that out there before we move and settle some really... petty, silly disputes.  [Stifles laughter.]  Because like all of us, we deserve from time to time just wear—what are you wearing, Jennifer Marmor? Just a simple linen... top? For yourself? Yeah! We all need to wear a simple linen top for ourselves sometimes. Take a little break, and wrap our minds around... the bad ideas of weird dads. And what things are sandwiches and what aren\\'t sandwiches. And in this episode— [laughs]  truly one of the most puzzling conundrums about playing the game of Twenty Questions that I\\'ve ever come across. So, Summertime Guest Bailiff Monte Belmonte... Why don\\'t you start us off? monte Speaking of sandwiches—which, I think you are now the arbiter of everything sandwich-oriented—here\\'s something from Katie May. john I wish that—if only that were true. If only that were true. monte [Laughs.]  You\\'re the Mayor of Sandwich, Massachusetts, which is  not Hotdog , Massachusetts. john No, I am not—I am not—I\\'m not the major, I\\'m not even the selectperson of Sandwich, Mass— monte You\\'re the judge of Sandwich, Massachusetts?  [Pause.] john No—oh!  [Laughs.]  Yeah, there is a town in Massachusetts called Sandwich! I forgot that!  [Monte laughs.]  No. The—I wish I could get the BLT to the city in Sandwich, Massachuetts. But I am not so honored. It is still—the debate over the sandwichness of hotdogs...  [exasperated]  continues! Even though I fully settled it on this podcast years ago!  Bit.ly/...JJHOTDOG (JJHo + hotdog, \"JJ Hote-dog\") [John laughs, Monte cracks up.]  —J-J-H-O-T-D-O-G, all capital letters, if you wanna hear my final ruling on why a hotdog is not a sandwich. But I do love sandwiches, and I love thinking about \\'em and talking about \\'em! So tell me, what\\'s the dispute? monte This comes from Katie May. She has a dispute with her husband about sandwich-making. And she says: \"One of us thinks mayo and lettuce go on the sandwich before grilling. The other things hot mayo and wilted lettuce are an affront to all that is holy. Please help.\" And you have asked for clarification on what type of sandwiches are in question, and Katie May said— john Yeah. monte \"I\\'m a vegetarian, so for me it\\'s cheese and veggies. For him, it sometimes includes sliced ham or turkey.\" john So I also dug a little deeper into this question with Katie May, and determined that the grilling they\\'re talking about, Monte, for your clarification, \\'cause I want your take on this— monte Okay. john I believe it is a panini press. monte Not grilling. john Well, in New England, a grilled cheese is not something that\\'s been pressed in a panini. monte Oh, yeah. john It\\'s been—something that\\'s been buttered on both sides, and... and, you know, cooked in a skillet. You know what I mean? monte Right. john But this is a panini press situation. And... would you put mayonnaise... on a panini that you are grilling? And would you put lettuce on a panini you are grilling? monte Mm. john And while I can see you—  [Monte laughs.]  —and I can see the utter disdain on your face, I\\'m—I will remind you this is a audio-only podcast. monte And audio-only court. Um, absolutely not. john Yeah. monte I am a huge proponent of mayonnaise. I— john Well... monte You wanna put mayonnaise on your cereal— john Right. monte —I\\'m gonna back you on that. john We\\'re two white guys from New England, of course mayonnaise is  [inaudible] monte Yeah. We are mayonnaise! We are the living embodiment—you are what you eat! And we are mayonnaise. Maybe I am Hellmann\\'s. \\'Cause you reach for the Hellmann\\'s, you reach for the best.  [Laughs.] john There is very—very little distinction from my midsection right now, and what it looks like when you open a fresh jar of Hellmann\\'s. That little—that pasty-white swirl of fresh mayonnaise. monte Right. If you could take the mayonnaise jar and burn a very small portion of the back of it, that\\'s how I look right now. Because I went and sat by the Connecticut River over the weekend, so... I\\'m like burned mayonnaise. john Are you saying mayonnaise burns red like your skin? monte No, it doesn\\'t, but... you know. john [Inaudible.] monte No analogy you can take so far. At any rate, you put mayonnaise— john Alright, you love—you love mayonnaise. monte Put mayonnaise on things, yes. Not before grilling, no. john Right. There shouldn\\'t—so, if you\\'re making a panini, mayonnaise should not—never be a part of it. If you\\'re— monte Right. I question whether you should call that \"grilling\" in the first place. john Well, now— monte Like, I give you grilled cheese. But if you told me you were gonna make a grilled, like, turkey sandwich? Immediately I would think like, \"Oh, you\\'re gonna put it on an open flame on like a—a back—\" john Who would ever do that? monte I don\\'t know. john You\\'re making up a new thing! monte Alright. Eh... crosstalk Monte:  Nobody puts turkey sandwiches—  John:  Making a turkey sandwich, but putting it on a grill? monte No. But when— john You would never do that, Monte. monte No, I wouldn\\'t. But I gr—I do grill a lot! Like, I grill everything on an actual flame grill in my back yard. john Mm-hm. monte And then yet, at the same time, my children make grilled cheeses, and I—I never do that. john Just as east of the Mississippi, Hellmann\\'s Mayonnaise is called Hellmann\\'s Mayonnaise, and west of the Mississippi it is called Best Foods. monte Oh! john You know—Jennifer Marmor, nodding in solemn assent of that knowledge. monte Nice to know this! john So there is still regionalism within this country, so some people will say \"grilled cheese\" when others would say \"toasted cheese,\" for something that is cooked in a skillet. And I am perfectly willing to allow Katie May and her husband to call panini-grilling \"grilling.\" monte Okay. john Panani-pressing \"grilling.\" Just so long as they do not call grilling \"barbecue.\" monte No. john In which case, get off my podcast. monte Absolutely. john Okay. So... you say no. Katie May is right, husband is wrong. monte Yes, but if you wanna put mayonnaise on it after the fact, I\\'m not gonna stand in your way. john But how are you gonna do that if you\\'re grilling cheese into the panini? You see what I mean? monte If you— [laughs]  if you love mayonnaise so much that you wanna put it on the top of the— [laughs]  of the grilled panini? john Right. monte Again, I\\'m not—I\\'m not gonna stand in your way. john Here—alright, so here\\'s a solution. And I—again, I\\'m not making a ruling yet. monte Okay. john But if you wish, Katie May\\'s husband—if you wanna follow the Monte Belmonte way, and you are making a sliced ham or turkey panini, and you\\'re adding cheese to it, because why wouldn\\'t you if you\\'re grill—if you\\'re putting anything in a panini? Come on. monte Absol—why—you don\\'t even need to grill it if you\\'re not putting cheese on it! john Right. But you have to keep one of the sides of the panini un-cheesed, so that it—so that you can take off that bread and add fresh, cool, Monte Belmonte–style cold mayonnaise. monte What about this? john With the hot hot, and the cool cool. Yeah. monte What if you grill the whole sandwich, both sides—again, I use \"grilling\" loosely here. And then you have—you\\'ve made your own fake aioli, which means... mayonnaise that you bought at a store— john [Stifles laughter.]  Yeah. monte —and truffled olive oil that you bought at a store. john Mm. monte And then you dip the grilled sandwich into a bowl of the cold mayonnaise and truffled aioli. And then you bite it, and then maybe... I want that sandwich. john How about this? This is called the John Hodgman Special. How about you make a ham and cheese sandwich, get a bowl of cold mayonnaise, throw the sandwich away, and just get a spoon and eat that mayonnaise? ...I think that just—a lot of people just threw up. monte Nope! Not this person!  [John laughs quietly.]  Because you are what you eat! john I have to send a message to... my wife. Because there was a panin—there was a legit panini that we had in a foreign country that blew our minds. And I wanna know whether it had mayonnaise on it or not.  [Faint clicking as John types out a message. He reads it out, somewhat stilted as he\\'s making it up and typing it on the spot.]  \"What was in that panini we liked so much? Did it have mayonnaise?\"  [Some more typing, ending with a decisive final tap, presumably sending the message.]  I\\'ll let you know what was in that—this is a little tease! Little podcast tease! Stay tuned! monte Yeah! If you wanna know what was in the panini, you\\'ll have to listen to the end of the podcast! And also... have you tried this timeshare in the Cape of Cod? john We don\\'t have—we\\'re not doing any timeshare ads, Monte! monte Okay. Fine. john I don\\'t know what\\'s going on there at WRSI.  [Monte laughs quietly.]  No timeshare—no timeshares. crosstalk Monte:  We\\'re really scraping bottom of the battle for—at the—  John:  Alright! Here\\'s—here\\'s what I\\'m gonna say. Here\\'s what I\\'m gonna say, Monte. monte Okay. john I agree with you... 99.99999%. monte [Sighs quietly.]  Okay. john But... you have overlooked one of the greatest sandwiches in the world. That specifically involved hot mayonnaise. Tuna melt! monte Damn. Okay. john Tuna melt! monte Can I say that? john Yeah, you can say \"damn.\" monte Okay. john These are challenging times. We need to be able to express ourselves. monte Damn. You\\'re right. Hot... tuna. john Tuna melt—Hot Tuna is a band. It is also an ingredient.  [Laughs.]  In a tuna melt. And how does it get hot? You grill it! And it\\'s—there\\'s mayonnaise in there, man. There\\'s mayonnaise in that tuna. Do you like a tuna melt? Or what you would call a tuner melt? monte Tuner melt! I do. Maybe the—your ruling should say that like, if they would like to hot-grill mayonnaise with turkey, that they have to then start a commensurate band with the same name.  [John laughs.]  So like, \"We\\'re the new band Hot Turkey!\" john Hot Turkey? Yeah. No. I don\\'t wanna hear Katie May\\'s and her husband\\'s band Hot Turkey. monte Hm. john I just want them to enjoy themselves. monte Right. john Um, yeah! I—I have to say... that while I agree with Katie May, that grilling either in a panini or skillet environment lettuce is gross... monte Yeah. john ...I would admit mayonnaise on a grilled sandwich. monte Okay. It seems fair. john The other day, I—I grilled a sandwich. One of the classic grilled sandwiches, or what we say \"pressed\" sandwiches. monte Mm. I prefer that. john I did a—I did a Cubano sandwich. Which is a cl—the classic South Florida sandwich of... roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard, pickles. And I pressed that—because I don\\'t have a sandwich press—I put it in a skillet, and I put a piece of parchment paper on top, and I slammed a cast iron pan on top of that.  [Monte laughs.]  And then I put a kettle full of water on it. monte [Laughs.]  I love it. john And it worked really well. And you know what—you know... what I also did? ...I added mayonnaise. monte When it was grilling? john Yeah. monte Wow.  [Hissing intake of breath.] john And you know what? It—you know what? Worked. Worked good.  [Beat.]  I don\\'t mind hot mayonnaise! I getcha. If it\\'s not for you, Katie May, that\\'s fine. But I think that there is—I think the tuna melt invalidates your argument that it is never allowable. One more thing before we move on, with regard to the grilling of sandwiches, which... during, uh, pandemic, uh, stay-at-home, I have been doing a lot of, obviously, and thinking a lot about sandwiches... Do you know the trick, Monte, of making a grilled cheese with mayonnaise instead of butter? monte No! john Yeah, Jennifer Marmor is nodding her head. monte Well, well, well! john Knowingly! monte My children grill a lot of cheeses. john Yeah. monte So I\\'m eager to hear this. john I think I picked this up from Ken Reid, also a Massachusettsian.  [Monte applauds briefly.]  Host of the  TV Guidance Counselor  podcast. But there is a tradition, and perhaps it\\'s a New England one or perhaps he picked it up just from the Internet, of instead of taking your bread and putting butter on the exterior of the bread and then grilling it with your cheese in a pan, use mayonnaise instead. And it browns really well! And it tastes—it does not taste mayonnaise-y. It tastes super crispy. monte Wow! john When you get that out monte So instead of butter, you just put mayonnaise in the pan. john Yeah. Yeah. monte That seems very easy. It seems dangerous... for somebody who hasn\\'t tried it. john No—no— monte But I\\'m willing to take that risk. john You wanna heat up the pan for a while at low heat. And then I know normally you would put a big lob of butter in there, and it would sizzle around, and you flip the sandwich— monte Yeah. You know how butter\\'s gonna react in there. What\\'s gonna happen if I put mayonnaise in here? john It\\'s—no. This is what you do— monte Am I gonna set the house on fire?! john Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Monte. Calm down. Heat up your thing—heat up your pan. monte Okay. john Low—you know, low-to-medium heat. Get it reasonably hot. It\\'s clean. Take your piece of bread. You mayonnaise one side of it. Put it mayonnaise-side-down in the pan. Put your cheese on that bread. Mayonnaise another slide of bread. Put that mayonnaise-size  (sic)  up. And walk away. And then come back, flip it. You\\'re done! Oh. One last thing. Can this podcast be five hours long and only about mayonnaise, Jennifer? monte YES! john [Laughs quietly.]  I learned this—speaking of Team  Judge John Hodgman monte Yeah. john ...from expert witness Kenji López-Alt! The great food writer, the author of Food Lab. He\\'s got a YouTube channel, he\\'s got recipes all over the place. This is the guy who invented the concept of the reverse-sear steak. You know what that is, Monte? monte No, but this is a cooking podcast now, so I\\'m all ears. john Go—no, you have to go back and listen to, uh,  Judge John Hodgman  verdict number 465, \" Licorice-Adjacent Flavor .\" That\\'s a good one. Kenji López-Alt. Really, really smart, science-based food writer. But not like, wonky science. Not pure science. Like, he is fun. He mixes things up. And speaking of mixing things up... and speaking of mayonnaise, and speaking of—of hot... Kenji López-Alt has a recipe for chicken breasts marinated in chimichurri, which is a parsley, garlic, onion, olive oil sort of pesto that is used as a steak seasoning in Argentina. And mayonnaise. That\\'s it. Go find  this recipe , because it has changed my life. monte Is it on the podcast? john No, that\\'s not on that podcast, but it\\'s on—it\\'s on the Internet. I\\'ve—I discovered it since we recorded. Kenji López-Alt held that back from me! monte Damn him. john Which I consider to be a crime. You pound your chicken breast into the quarter-inch even thickness. You get your chimichurri, you whip it up. Then you take like a quarter cup of mayonnaise, whip that into it, and then you just let it sit in that mayonnaise-y, garlicky, parsley marinade, for like up to... an hour? Or a day! And then you just pull it outta there. You don\\'t do anything. You just throw that right on the grill. Ho—you know. Whatever. Three—three, five minutes total? Depending on the thickness? Maybe six? I\\'ve never had a better food, almost, pretty much. And I—you know what it\\'s all thanks to? Mayonnaise. If you don\\'t like mayonnaise, don\\'t send me letters. What did I say? Okay, so, Katie May. Hot mayonnaise, okay. Hot lettuce, no good. sound effect [Three gavel bangs.] monte Maddie says: \"My husband Nick and I just bought a house next-door to a church with a public Wi-Fi network. Nick wants to use the church\\'s network instead of purchasing our own Wi-Fi. I\\'ll also add we\\'ve been splitting the cost of Wi-Fi with various neighbors for almost seven years, so we have never owned our own Wi-Fi. I believe that what Nick wants to do... is stealing. It\\'s time for us to be adults, and have our own network. I ask that you issue an injunction against Nick\\'s use of the public church Wi-Fi.\" john Monte, I just want you and the listeners to know that I have received the information back from my wife with regard— monte [Audible exclamation point] john —to the panino that we had! monte Panino? Good use of Italian!  [Claps once.]  Hodgman. john That\\'s right. \\'Cause it\\'s one of—it\\'s one panino. It\\'s many panini. monte One graffito. Many graffiti. john Right. And it was one of the greatest sandwiches I ever had in my life, and I will reveal the details after the break! But first—  [Monte bursts out laughing.]  —here\\'s what I have to say to Maddie! Uh, Monte, what do you think?  [Laughs.] monte I think, um, given a pandemic, you can steal the Wi-Fi until the pandemic is over. john Whoa. monte And then you need to get back to real life and be a grown-up. Right now, we are in— john Mm. monte We are in, like,  Beyond Thunderdome  land right now. So it\\'s like, every person for themself, and also Tina Turner. john [Dismayed]  No. No, Monte, no.  [Laughs quietly.] monte Okay? No? So, that\\'s why I\\'m the bailiff. john It\\'s not every person for themselves. We have to be together on this! monte Oh, yeah, right! We\\'re all in this together! Even—yeah. john Yeah. This isn\\'t—this isn\\'t Bartertown!  [Laughs quietly.] monte Okay. Alright. john You know? This is—this is like, we all have to— monte Two men enter, one man leaves! john [Fighting laughter]  No!!! It\\'s not a Thu— monte That\\'s not it? john It\\'s not a Thunderdome! monte I\\'ve been operating  Beyond the Thunderdome  principles this whole time! john What has been happening in Northampton?!  [Monte laughs.]  No wonder you\\'re wearing that suit of armor made of chicken bones, and a weird doll\\'s mask! Have you become a lawless raider up there in Northampton? monte Yes! john It\\'s not the one I remembered. monte You know. These are difficult times. john It\\'s all about doing our best practices, wearing our masks, keeping our distance, following the science news, learning about anti-racism, supporting each other. It\\'s not about all—getting as much free Wi-Fi as you can, Monte! monte But here\\'s the thing! Nobody\\'s going to church right now! So— john NO! monte —when people start going back to the church... then yes. You need to get your own Wi-Fi. But right now— john See—look. You\\'re counting on a return to normalcy of some kind. What I\\'m saying is we need to forge a new, better normal together. Based on principles. monte [Grudgingly]  Alright... john Now, if you wanna eat— [laughs]  three tuna melts a day... monte With mayo! john That\\'s your business. Self care. And I understand your argument! That no one\\'s at that church right now, the Wi-Fi\\'s just sitting there. It\\'s pooling. It\\'s pooling around the pews, they\\'ve got more than they can use. monte Right! It wants to be used! john Yeah. And maybe the church doesn\\'t mind if you use that Wi-Fi! It\\'s church! monte Right! john [Sing-song]  But there\\'s a very easy way to find out! And that\\'s... to ask!  [More sternly]  The church! monte Not hack the church? john Ask— [laughs]  don\\'t hack the church! Ask the church! monte The password is \"Jesus\"! Because I read a bumper sticker that said \"Jesus is the answer.\" So if you\\'re looking for the Wi-Fi password... john No... monte Jesus is the answer. john No. Here\\'s—here\\'s the thing, Maddie and Nick. Maddie knows what\\'s right. This is the Parable of the Soda Fountain. This has come up on  Judge John Hodgman many a time , and it shall come up many a time again. It is one of the great teaching tools in the liturgy of the church of  Judge John Hodgman . Monte... Two pilgrims go—I mean, this is happening in olden times, right, \\'cause people could go to restaurants then. monte Right. john Two pilgrims go to an In-N-Out Burger in California. There is a soda fountain there, offering lo these many sodas. And then there is a button for water, and then there is a button for seltzer. Is it acceptable to fill up your cup with seltzer or water without paying for it? \"Because after all,\" sayeth one pilgrim, \"the cost incurred by the In-N-Out is the soda syrup! Your Doctors Pepper. Your Cokes and Cherries, and all the rest.\" And lo, Judge John Hodgman sayeth unto the pilgrim... \"Maybe! It depends! Just ask them!\"  [Laughs quietly.]  \"Don\\'t ask me! I don\\'t run an In-N-Out! There are more costs associated than you think of in a soda fountain than just the cost of the syrup! There is electricity, there is maintenance, etc., etc., etc. And yeah, it\\'s just water, or just seltzer water. And maybe they\\'re like \\'Go for it.\\' Maybe they\\'re like \\'Here\\'s a cup for you to filleth and slaketh your thirst from my soda fountain with just plain seltzer, if you wish. For I am a Good Samaritan.\\' Or maybe they will say, \\'No, but you can buy a cup for a dollar and have as many free refills as you want,\\' or whatever!\" The lesson of the Parable of the Soda Fountain, Monte, is that there is no reason to talk yourself into taking something that you want for free, when the proper thing to do is to simply... ask. There is no reason to come up with a system, or a scheme, or an explanation, as to why it is okay to take a thing for free, when the avenue is available to you to simply ask and be told yes or no! Especially if the answer\\'s probably yes! It\\'s church! They\\'ll probably say \"Fine.\" Being a grown-up, Maddie—I appreciate that you\\'re wanting to grow up, Maddie. But being a grown-up does not mean... buying your own Wi-Fi. A lot of people try to define grown-up-ness by the fact that they can buy stuff. Like, \"I\\'m a grown-up \\'cause I bought a car!\" No. Being a grown-up means not being a sneak! Not trying to cheat the system! Means going up to the people in the—your world and say, \"May I have this for free?\"  [Stifles laughter.] john And if they say \"No—no, it\\'s mine,\" then you go, \"Oh, I get it. No problem. Thought I\\'d ask.\" We\\'re trying to have a civilization here. We\\'re trying. We\\'re trying really hard. And part of this time is having conversations that are not always comfortable face-to-face with our neighbors. And to a lot of people—including me!—having a simple face-to-face conversation such as \"May I steal Wi-Fi here?\" can feel a little, like, uh, hard to do! But I\\'m telling you, the more you go up to the people in your world, no matter who they are, no matter what they look like, no matter what their background is, and just have the conversation you need to have, even if it does not end with the result that you want, even if they tell you things that are hard for you to hear, you grow as a person from having direct contact with other people. At a safe distance! That\\'s the other complicating factor. Don\\'t go the way... of Northampton.  [Monte cracks up.]  Don\\'t go the way of a dystopian Thunderdome,  Fury Road –type situation like Northampton, Massachusetts. sound effect [Three gavel bangs.] john Now let\\'s move on, Monte, \\'cause I know you gotta— [laughs quietly]  you\\'re taking a run down the Fury Road to the gas farm later, so... monte [Singing, high-pitched] We don\\'t need another heeerooo!

This week we\\'re clearing the docket, and Leslie says: \"My partner spends a lot of time listening to comedy podcasts like yours,\" and I will add the Webby Award–winning  Judge John Hodgman  podcast, \"and laughing hysterically. While it\\'s a minor annoyance at home, it\\'s become a point of debate in public. I\\'ve shushed his cackling on every form of transportation imaginable. Cross-country flights, overnight bus rides in foreign countries, quiet train cars, the list goes on. Am I right that he needs to clam up and stop embarrassing me, or is this acceptable behavior that I just happen to find annoying? How do you tell your loving partner of six years that his face is cute, but not when hyena sounds come out of it? I\\'m seeking an injunction to end this behavior for good, and save hundreds of innocent people from disruptive giggles.\" john [John starts laughing, which builds into cartoonishly over-the-top evil cackling.] crosstalk Monte:  I have—I think—  John:  Is he laughing like that, do you think? Is it a villain laugh? monte I imagined he\\'s laughing like me, and I have a Wicked Witch of the West laugh. john Really?? monte Like, there are people that can recognize me no matter what the circumstances, because they hear this—  [High-pitched cackle, a somewhat exaggerated version of how Monte has cracked up a couple times during this episode.]  —kind of cackle. john Wow! monte And that\\'s like, my legitimate laugh. john I don\\'t like that. monte And there\\'s another person that I know that has a very similar laugh, and so we have actually been confused in public spheres because our cackles are so similar. john I don\\'t like that, Monte. That\\'s—that brought me right back to when  Wizard of Oz  was on television once a year.  [Monte does a more theatrical cackle.]  Stop it! What are you gonna do? You\\'re gonna—I feel like Monte\\'s—I can see you, but I still, in my mind\\'s eye I\\'m picturing you on top of a thatched hut, throwing fireballs at me! Trying to set me on fire, like a scarecrow! That\\'s—I don\\'t like that! It\\'s scary! Which is more—I\\'m gonna answer Leslie\\'s question in a second. monte Right. john \\'Cause we actually do have a recording of her partner\\'s laugh. monte Oh! john I think will—I think will make a lot of difference. monte Okay. john But when it comes to traumatic childhood movies, which is worse?  Wizard of Oz , or  Watership Down monte I— john The Wiz, or the Wat? monte I know for you it\\'s  Watership Down , \\'cause literally any time I see a picture from  Watership Down  on social media, I know it is John Hodgman that has posted it.  [Laughs.] john I\\'m talking about the animated film— monte Oh, yes. john —from 1979 or so. Not the Netflix remake, which I have not seen, because it seems unnecessary, but if people like it, let me know. If you\\'re of an age to know what movies I\\'m talking about, tell us in the Reddit, the  Judge John Hodgman Reddit discussion for this episode , which was more traumatic for you? As a child of the seventies and eighties.  Wizard of Oz Watership Down , or the miniseries  I, Claudius . Alright. Now— monte Oh! I thought you loved that one. I just assumed, \\'cause of  the podcast , but— john I do! I do, but—but if you\\'re a kid who accidentally watches it— [laughs] monte Right. john It\\'s—it\\'s got some heavy stuff. It\\'s got some—it\\'s got some intense—intense scenes. Alright. I don\\'t want you to ever laugh that way at me ever again, Monte. But can I stop you from laughing that way? That\\'s the crux of this issue. I don\\'t like it... but do I—even if I were your partner, your romantic partner in life, your husband, which would be a lovely outcome to an alternate timeline... monte Absolutely. john Would I have the right to say that that laugh—because it scares me so much, causes me damages—that you must not do it? Is it that disruptive? Because that\\'s really what this comes down to. In many ways, you know—Leslie sent this in, obviously, when travel was still a possibility. monte Right. john When ideas like, um... you know, cross-country flights, and overnight bus rides in foreign countries, and quiet train cars—boy—boy, oh boy! Who is—who—who\\'s Leslie? Hercule Poirot? Planes, trains, and automobiles, solving—anyway. Everywhere they go together, Leslie\\'s partner laughs. But that\\'s all done now. However, we are working together. Face-to-face, person-to-person, safely, to build a new and better normal. And will Leslie\\'s partner\\'s laugh be part of that new normal? Let\\'s take a listen. clip [Leslie\\'s partner progresses from quiet giggles to several loud, distinct peals of laughter, back down to giggles. Someone says something indistinct at the end.] john And, uh, we\\'ll listen to it one more time. clip [Clip repeats.] john Now, see, that laugh does not scare or disturb me. It\\'s—it\\'s loud. I\\'ll give it that. But what I find—the laugh is not the problem. It\\'s the weird under-mutter. Did you hear that?  [Monte laughs.]  I\\'ll do my imitation of Leslie\\'s partner. \"Huhh?? Hua— [\"H\"-noises turn into laughter, and then back into indistinct laugh-mumbling, which seems to represent the giggles bookending the louder laughter in the clip.] \" That was the non-laughing, but weird, kind of like,  \"[indistinct murmur]\" , talking to yourself kind of thing that gave it a—a kind of Joker-style menace. Monte, if you were on... I don\\'t know, a cross-country flight, an overnight bus ride in a foreign country, or a quiet train car, and Leslie\\'s partner was over there with earbuds in, making that noise? How would you feel? monte I didn\\'t notice the kind of under-murmur. But that now is all of a sudden disturbing to me. So the out—initial outburst of laughing, to me, seemed very joyful. john Mm-hm. monte But you gave it a dark twist. And now I can\\'t un-hear that under-murmur. john Right. monte Where... they seem like they have reeled in the legitimate expression of joy, and— john So I\\'ve poisoned the well of your judgment— monte Yes. john —with my insight, obviously. monte So the laugh itself, I\\'m fine with. john You\\'re fine? You would be fine if you were in a quiet train car, or an overnight bus in a foreign country, with a guy listening to even the  Judge John Hodgman  podcast, going—  [John and Monte both cackle. John keeps it up for several seconds, hooting cartoonishly.]  Like—like—like, uh, Christopher Lloyd in  Who Framed Roger Rabbit  at the end? monte Oh, yeah. john No. monte Um, no. Actually, no. john Would not be cool. That would not be cool. monte In normal circumstances—like, that\\'s, like, you\\'re at home. You\\'re on a car ride. All of that. I think, yes. Let that bubble up and express itself in the way that it will in your body. john Right. monte But you do need to know your surroundings. So even when I am like, in bed watching something funny and my wife is sleeping next to me, and I know she\\'s sleeping— john Right. Right. monte You gotta reel that in. You gotta try.  [Laughs.] john Yeah! Yeah, I mean— monte I\\'m not always successful. Perfectly honest. john We have had—we have had partners who had difficulty with their partners\\' sneezes, which you think are an involuntary noise, but you can reign in your sneeze in certain public situations. monte I can\\'t, actually. My children have deemed my sneeze the Hamilton sneeze, because it sounds like I\\'m saying \"The issue!\"  [John snorts.]  Like when he says \"The issue on the table\"? That is how I sneeze every time, totally without thinking about it. john You can—you can—look. You don\\'t— monte I could—I could stifle it, but I might blow my eardrums out. john They\\'re not gonna blow your eardrums out. monte I might. john You don\\'t have to laugh like the Wiz—the Wiz—Wicked Witch of the West. monte I do. john But I love you, and I allow you to do it. monte ThThank you. john When you\\'re around friends, Leslie\\'s partner—including Leslie, who frankly... you know, you\\'re presumably your partner\\'s best friend—you laugh... laugh the way you want! I\\'m never gonna try to stifle laughter, especially not in this time. But when you\\'re in public, laughing uproariously—especially with a creepy under-mutter—in a closed cabin of a cross-country flight, overnight bus in a foreign country, or quiet train car, is not only impolite, but bear in mind, droplet city. monte Oh, yeah. john Listen to something else! Listen to  The Fifth Season  by N. K. Jemisin. Listen to a novel. Listen to a podcast. Listen to  So You Want To Talk About Race , by Ijeoma Oluo. Or listen to  Minority Korner  on Maximum Fun! That\\'s funny, though. That\\'s funny. But, you know— monte Can I make—can I make a recommendation? john Take some time, then, to think and—and think and not laugh so much. What? Yeah, you can make a recommendation. monte There\\'s a book called  This Book Is Anti-Racist: 20 Lessons on how to Wake Up, Take Action, and Do the Work , by Tiffany Jewell, who happens to live in Northampton, Massachusetts. And I think it might be an excellent addition to the not-laughing-out-loud— john Yeah. monte —and really taking some important self-assessment in these times when we need to be together apart. john Yeah! That sounds appropriately un-hilarious. monte Right! john Or, you know, listen to something just... fun and low-key, but not comedic. Unless you can get that laugh under control, Leslie\\'s partner. You have an obligation to people in closed spaces around you who are not Leslie, and your close friends. Do not scare them the way that Monte scared me. sound effect [Three gavel bangs.] monte Sorry. john Alright. Let\\'s move on. monte Let\\'s take a quick break.

Here\\'s something from Josh! john Okay, here it comes. This is payoff number one of tease number one. Top of the show, I teased a conundrum regarding Twenty Questions. At the end of the first third of the show, I teased the best panino I ever had. Here comes payoff one! Stand by for payoff two. Go ahead. monte You—any time you wanna do a show on any of our radio stations in Northampton, Judge John Hodgman, you are more than welcome. Here is something from Josh: \"I\\'m—\" john Wow. They call me Chef Tease, of Sandwich, Massachusetts. monte [Laughs.]  I\\'m sorry, that\\'s a— john Cooking up them teases! monte There was a little bit of the cackle right there. john I know, I gotcha. It\\'s fine. But see? You got it under control. You\\'re a professional. monte Right, I—I reeled it in. \"I\\'m seeking the judge\\'s wisdom on a semantic—\" john You wouldn\\'t laugh that—you wouldn\\'t laugh that way on the radio! monte Oh, I do it all the time. crosstalk John:  Do you now?  Monte:  I cry on the radio. I\\'m so unprofessional. john Well, I know you cry. But you do the Wicked Witch laugh on the radio?? monte Sometimes. john Yeah, and you reel it in. You let it go for the podcast. You reel it in for the radio. I know you, Monte Belmonte. You are professional. monte I do my bel—best to be professional, but I don\\'t always succeed. john Alright. Let\\'s hear—let\\'s hear from Josh. I apologize. monte \"I\\'m seeking the judge\\'s wisdom on a semantic issue. My wife and I were playing Twenty Questions. My answer was \\'Amazon River.\\' And my wife asked me \\'Is it on land?\\' And I answered \\'Yes.\\' But that didn\\'t go over very well. How should I have answered?\" john Now— monte I love this question so much.  [Both laugh. Monte cackles a little more freely this time.]  There it is again. john Yeah. There it is. That\\'s good. That was good. That wasn\\'t the same as the one that really scared me, where it— monte Sorry. john Your whole face turned green, too. That was weird. monte Yeah, I know. john So he was playing with his wife, Twenty Questions. The answer that he had prepped in his mind was \"the Amazon River.\" monte Right. john And she\\'s asking, like, \"Is it a famous person?\" \"No.\" Obviously. Uh, \"Is it a, uh, fictional character?\" \"No.\" Obviously. \"Is it on land?\" And then according to my reading on his letter, he had a little question mark after \"Yes.\" So I feel like she— monte \"Yes??\" john I feel like she said \"Is it on land?\" and he said \"Mm, yyyesss??\" monte Right. john Which frankly, I think, in Twenty Questions is a fairly fair—that is to say, playable—clue that the answer is not—is a little tricky. And that gives information to the questioner. monte Yeah. john So I think that he played fair. Right? If he said \"Yyess?\" monte \"Yeeeesss??\" john Because then Josh\\'s wife can start to like, \"Well, wait a minute, how—how can it sort of be on land?\" And then might get to the point where it\\'s like, \"Oh, is it a body of water?\" Right? \"Yes!\" And then you\\'re off to the races. Then all you have to do is name every river in the world, and you\\'re done. monte Right. john And luckily, there—there are only ten of them. So... you get ten qu— monte And Amazon is going to be the first one that you\\'re gonna guess, and probably try to make an order from— john Right. Right. monte —in, you know, an inebriated late-night, uh, decision. john [Laughs.]  So anyway—but that still doesn\\'t settle the question. Is it on land?  [Beat.] monte Yes. john If you were gonna answer that question without the question mark, what would you say? Is it on land? monte [Laughs.]  I have no idea how to answer this question, which is kinda why I love it. john Is the Amazon River on... land? monte I think the only actual answer is the answer that he probably gave in his testimony, which is... \"Yes?\" Like, it\\'s— john Jennifer Marmor, I can see you, but you can\\'t speak.  [Monte laughs.]  What, using only body language, is the an—she— monte It\\'s \"yes??\" john She put her hands palms-up in the, uh, international symbol for either \"Yes??\" or \"I really don\\'t care, can we move on?\"  [Monte and John laugh.]  Well, now she\\'s drawing her finger across her throat.  [Laughs.] monte Oh, dear. john \"Kill this segment.\" No. She\\'s not doing that. monte One of my favorite Twenty Question, like, answers for other people— john Yeah. Yeah. monte —is Twenty Questions, yes.  [John exhales loudly.]  So like, you have to guess that what I\\'m— [laughs] —thinking of— john Whoooa. monte —is Twenty Questions.  [Laughs.] john You\\'re a— monte And that causes all sorts of conundrums like this. john I— monte Which is part of the reason I really love this particular question. Like, \"Is it on land?\" \"Yes??? It is! I guess!\" john Oh, Monte, I\\'m—now—I\\'m so glad that I know that.  [Monte laughs.]  So that I never get tricked into playing the game with you. Whew! You\\'re a little bit younger than me. You\\'re a true child of the nineties, so you got meta in your bones. monte Sorry. john [Stuffily]  \"The answer to your twenty questions is \\'Twenty Questions.\\'\" monte Right. john \"The show is the show of the show.\" monte Right. john \"This is the show of the show.\"  [Monte chuckles.]  Here\\'s the answer! Josh, first of all, I\\'ve established played correctly. But if you want—and frankly, generously, because you gave her valuable information to teasing out the correct answer. However, if you wanted to answer without a question mark, a definitive yes or no... the Amazon River is on land. Yes. Because—  [Both laugh.]  What\\'s at the bottom of the river? Land. monte Wow. john It\\'s sitting on land! It\\'s sitting in a valley of land. It\\'s moving over the riverbed. Which is... soggy land! monte Man. john But land. And you can dispute this if you want, in the Reddit, too. What was the most traumat—which was more traumatic?  I, Claudi —in your childhood?  I, Claudius Watership Down Wizard of Oz , and how wrong is John Hodgman on this one? Go ahead! I know I\\'m right. But the fact is he played correctly. Because by going \"Yes??\"— monte Right. john —instead of \"Yes\"—saying \"Yes\" plainly would be a misdirection to her, a real misdirection. It would be frankly as bad as playing the game and the answer being \"Twenty Questions.\"  [Monte laughs.] sound effect [Three gavel bangs.] monte If only she\\'d asked \"Is it blue on a map?\" I mean, that\\'s actually what we\\'re kind of thinking about here. john [Exhales thoughtfully.]  That\\'s a great way. That\\'s a great way. \\'Cause— monte How el—how would she know to ask that question?  [John exhales thoughtfully again.]  She would not. So I think... I think your ruling is correct. john Monte. Side show. monte Yes? john Alright?  [Monte laughs.]  A Maximum Fun one-off. A live-on-Zoom Twenty Questions competition between you and me. monte I love it.  [Cackles.]  Sorry. john We play three rounds, best two out of three. And then maybe we can figure out a way for viewers to qualify to try to stump us. monte Or we could choose in like, the comments. Like, \"I\\'m gonna ask this as one of my twenty questions.\" john No, no, I got it figured out. crosstalk John:  Don\\'t worry about it, Monte, I got it all—I got it all plotted out in my head.  Monte:  Okay. Alright. You know how to do this way better than I do. john We\\'re gonna do this. It\\'s gonna be good. Alright. monte Love it. john What\\'s the name of the game gonna be? Twenty Questions? monte Twenty-Twenty Questions. john Twenty— [laughs] monte And it\\'d be 20 rounds of Twenty Questions.  [Cracks up.] john No. Let\\'s move on.  [Stifles laughter.] monte That\\'s only... 400 questions!  [Laughs.] john Come up with a name! I wanna come up with a name. I\\'ll let everyone know as soon as we can work it out, Monte. This will be a fun thing to do of an evening. monte Absolutely. john With our listeners. Alright. Let\\'s move on. monte A listener named Hannah wrote in about a recent piece of Swift Justice that was issued. The question was whether or not a book is a device. The court decided that a book is not a device. john Yeah, Monte, let—let me read this. Because obviously I get a lot of pushback on my correct opinions. monte Mm-hm. john And this was one—and I normally just say \"Thank you for your input, but I stand by my decision.\" monte Yes. john But regarding whether or not a book was a device, a lot of people pushed back. Lot of—a lot of bookish people in the audience, which I love. And I start—I read this letter and I started to compose an argument as to why I was still correct, even though Hannah, you will learn, is a historian and publishing scholar who dedicates a lot of her time to trying to convince students that books are a technology like any other. But then I realized... You know what? I\\'m wrong. monte Wow. john Here\\'s what Hannah—so I\\'m gonna read this for Hannah. \"I\\'m a book historian and publishing scholar who dedicates a lot of my time to trying to convince students that books are a technology like any other. The desire to distinguish between electronic gizmos like eReaders, and print books—\" Which was my—that was personally my, John Hodgman\\'s, dividing line. You wouldn\\'t call a book a \"gizmo,\" therefore it\\'s not a device. \"The desire to distinguish between gizmos like eReaders and print books not only leads to all sorts of ableism, in that it seems to degrade eBooks, but also reflects an ahistorical tendency to pretend that books were never themselves new media. In fact, there are many moments in history that suggest how device-like these technologies once were. My favorite example—\" This is Hannah, still. \"—is that of Johannes Fust, the business partner of Johannes Gutenberg.\" The two Johanneses, they called them. That was me. monte It was  Two Johannesses and a Baby john Yeah.  [Laughs.] monte Starring Johannes Gutenberg! john Alright, back to Hannah\\'s letter. \"Johannes Fust loaned a significant amount of money to Gutenberg to fund his printed Bible. Just as the Bible was being completed, Fust brought suit against his business partner and got everything, including the Bibles. Fust then attempted to sell the printed Bibles in Paris as manuscripts. The authorities got wind of these uncannily identical books, and Fust was charged with witchcraft! Forcing him to reveal the secret of the Bibles, that they were in fact newfangled devices. That is to say, mechanically printed books. Some scholars have speculated that Fust was the inspiration for the legend of Doctor Faustus and his quest for limitless knowledge.\" monte Hm! john \"Given your established preference for historical accuracy over semantic categories—\" A preference that I don\\'t think is—I have established, but anyway, fine. \"—I may wanna reconsider whether books are in fact devices.\" And I do reconsider it! It is a hair that I split...ed. Right?  [Stifling laughter]  That\\'s the past tense of \"split\"? monte Splitted. john I splitted that hair. That gizmo vs. book hair. I never intended—and I apologize, Hannah—to suggest that books as a physical object were not, indeed, absolutely, historically, massively disruptive technology. And they are—you know, they are—while \"device\" tends to imply, in contemporary definitions, having an electronic component, which books do not, at least not printed books...  [Voice of a disgruntled teenager reluctantly apologizing to his parents]  You\\'re absolutely riiight that even thooough...  [Monte laughs quietly, John veers back out of the voice.]  ...a book is content that we refer to as being readable across many different kinds of devices, the physical thing we call a book is a hinge. It is mechanical. It was an invention. And I apologize. I got it wrong! First—first time in ten years. First time in ten years. I think. That I have admitted wrongdoing. See? I\\'m growing. crosstalk Monte: [Laughs.]  That was very—  John:  Alright! monte That was very big of you, Judge John Hodgman! john Well! It\\'s time for guys who look like me... monte Yeah. john ...to listen to the expertise of others, and adjust accordingly. monte Hear, hear. john So Hannah, thank you for your research. Thank you for that great story about Fust, and books being suspected of being the—the—the—the tools of witchcraft! Do the laugh now, Monte. Do the witch—  [Monte accommodates with a hearty cackle.] [John cries out in despair.]  \"Oh, Johannes Fust, you come to haunt me!\" monte [Laughs.] [High-pitched and menacing]  \"No, I\\'m Johannes Gutenberg!  [Cackles.] john \"Too many Johanneses!\" That\\'s it, the docket is clear! Thank you! For joining us again on another episode of  Judge John Hodgman . Our producer of course is Jennifer Marmor. monte Woo! john Follow us on Twitter. Monte Belmonte is, guess what,  @montebelmonte [Sort of chanting]  M-O-N-T! E! B-E-L-M! O-N! T-E!

[Both laugh.] monte Less like a cheer. john That was better, I thought. And I am  @hodgman . H! O! D! G! M-A-N! H! O! D! G!  [Slight pause, and then rapidly]  M-A-N!

Remember to talk about which is more traumatic in childhood,  Wizard of Oz  or  Watership Down . And how wrong I was about the other thing. But do NOT get in that Reddit and complain that I never revealed the best panino I ever had in my life! \\'Cause I saved it now! monte [Celebratory whisper-shout]  Yes! john To the very end! A long time ago—this is also a story from ancient times. monte It\\'s  American Pie [Singing] A long, long time ago— crosstalk John:  Not  American Pie Monte: [Singing] I once had a panino... john Oh, no. This is a— monte Sorry. john Now I\\'m doubly traumatized. monte Went into Weird Al territory right there. john Which is more traumatic?  Wizard of Oz  on TV,  Watership Down  in the movie theater or on VHS cassette, or listening to your dad at some point sing  American Pie [Monte makes a kind of creaky noise that could be laughter, agreement, or dismay.] [John laughs quietly.]  Anyway. It was not an  American Pie . Because in fact, we were in Venice, Italy. The most beautiful city in the world. Have you ever been, Monte? monte No, I have not. john Yeah. Well, you can\\'t go.  [Laughs.]  You can\\'t go! monte I hear plane tickets are real cheap right now. john Yeah. Can\\'t—you\\'re not allow—you can\\'t go. But I hope that when we forge this new, better normal together, part of that new, better normal will include finally addressing climate change issues that are currently causing Venice tooo disappear beneath the ocean, forever. But before that happens, near the Peggy Guggenheim Museum, there is a little bar called the Corner Pub. It is—in English, the name of it is \"Corner Pub.\" I mean, it presents itself as an Eng—quote-unquote \"English pub.\" But of course inside it\\'s very Italian. They have cicchetti. Cicchetti is the Venetian bar snack which is often just, like, a little piece of lard on a piece of bread, or like a—a toothpick and a huge piece of provolone. And—with an anchovy on it? It\\'s all—everything I love. monte It\\'s just mayo. Grilled. john Yeah, no. And then they have panini. Right? And this panino—I\\'m not gonna bury the lead. It did not have mayonnaise on it. monte Okay. john But it was... you know, long bread. monte Mm-hm. john In a panini press. With arugula, butter, speck—which is smoked prosciutto— monte [Emphatically]  Yes. john —and hard-boiled eggs. monte Oh, my. john And boy, was it good.  [Monte sighs.]  So! I\\'m gonna make one of those for my dinner tomorrow night, I guess.  [Monte laughs quietly.]  But now I\\'m gonna leave you— [laughs quietly] —and sadly leave you, Jennifer and Monte!

       "'dan mccoy On this episode we discuss:  Hawk the Slayer elliott kalan The movie that dares to ask the question—what if you watched your friends play D&D for an hour and a half, but you didn’t get to share their Doritos?  [Someone laughs quietly.] music Light, up-tempo, electric guitar with synth instruments. dan Hey, everyone, and welcome to  The Flop House ! I’m Dan McCoy. stuart Hey, Dan McCoy! It’s me! Stuart Wellington! elliott Over here is Elliott Kalan. Usually I’d waste a lot of time doing some kind of bit where I introduce my name and it takes a while? But we don’t have time for that! Because! I wanted to introduce our special guest star for this episode—an actual, honest-to-goodness, television superstar—that’s right—  [Dan laughs.]  Superstar, I said! You may know her as the creator and star of  The Guild . You may know her as a best-selling author! You may know her—like, you do know her—as Kinga Forrester on  Mystery Science Theater 3000 . The return for Netflix. Very excited to have Felicia Day with us today! Thank you so much for joining us! felicia day Heyyyy! Thanks for having me! crosstalk Dan : Now, Felicia—no, sorry. I—I—  [Laughs.]  Well-it—no! It seemed—it seemed like she had paused, but I—yeah.  Felicia : I’m really—what? What?! What, Dan? I had so much more! I had an opening monologue that I had, like..  Elliott : Dan! Dan! Our guest has barely started talking and you’ve already interrupted her!  [Stuart laughs.] dan I—no. I’m—this is historically my job on the show, is to do things wrong. So. felicia Oh, okay! I’m very good. I’ve never been—I’m usually best unkempt. Like, I wanna be a street urchin for the rest of my life. Every D&D character is “street urchin.” Street urchin. And it’s just so I don’t have to do my hair and makeup. dan No, all I wanted to say was I, of course, uh, am the biggest fan of Felicia from her work on, uh…  Buffy  and  Dr. Horrible . But— felicia Ohhh! dan I would be remiss in, uh, not mentioning that during the quarantine—a lotta people are doing watch-alongs. My friend had a watch-along of—for her birthday—of all of the  Bring it On  movies. And I was delighted—  [Felicia gasps.] crosstalk Dan : —to see her as the goth cheerleader in the second of those films.  Felicia : Ohhhhh nooo! felicia It was—I was a goth cheerleader healed by cheer! Like, I was the goth ballerina. Healed by cheer, basically.  [Multiple people laugh.]  That was… a blast from the past. That was a weird—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —that was a weird… that was a weird job. That’s when I did—that’s when I realized—not realized it? But I did wonder why… the director would hit on everybody.  [Laughs.] dan Mmm. crosstalk Elliott and Stuart : Mmmmm. felicia We won’t go into that, though. dan You’re hearing the Hollywood goss!  [Laughs.]  On this show. felicia Yeah. Exactly. The behind-the—BTS!  [Multiple people laugh.] dan Well, should we explain what we do or do we wanna talk about stuff? crosstalk Stuart : Yeah! We should—we should say what we do!  Elliott : We should probably explain what we do. elliott I mean, Dan—how many years have we been doing this show? dan Uh, it is about  [through laughter]  twelve years, I guess? felicia Wow! crosstalk Elliott : And yet each time—  Stuart : Almost thirteen! elliott Almost thirteen. And each time it’s as if you’ve never done it before.  [Multiple people laugh.] crosstalk Felicia : You have a freshness about you, Dan.  Dan : I think this—that’s—  [Laughs.] felicia Like you’ve never been behind a mic before. And that’s really—that’s really impressive that you’ve been doing this thirteen years.  [Multiple people laugh.] stuart It’s like somebody bonked him on the head and there were little birds tweeting around him and then they pushed him onto a microphone and he just started riffing. Y’know?  [Laughs.] dan Yup.  [Multiple people laugh.] felicia Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet! dan It provides kind of a ramshackle feel to the show. So people think that we’re just their idiot friends! See? felicia Listen. I love—like I said. Unpolished is my specialty. There’s nothing worse than trying to look good. You know you have a booger in your nose. You know what I’m saying? You walk out, you got toilet paper in your shoe. crosstalk Dan : In your shoe?  Elliott : And yet if you’re the guy who points— elliott Or the guy or lady who points to their nose and goes, “Check it out! A booger!” You’re everybody’s best friend all of a sudden. crosstalk Elliott : Like if you can call yourself out on it—  Felicia : Oh! You check— felicia You call yourself on it? ‘Cause I always tell other people and then they get mad at me that I told them and I’m like, did you want to go home and see that was in your nose and imagine all the people that—  [Dan laughs.]  —saw you with a booger in your nose? Then just go over and over and over in your mind all night? I mean, that’s what I would do.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Yeah. See, I would be— stuart I would just stare into the dark corners of the room. felicia Mm-hm! Mm-hm! stuart Thinking about all the mistakes you’ve made and—oh man. crosstalk Felicia : Yep.  Elliott : No, no, Stuart. Get out of that dark place. Stuart! Stuart! Get out of the pit!  Dan : Stuart. Are you—  Stuart : I can’t believe I said that thing!  [Laughs.] Dan : Are you doing your bit from—  Felicia : Oh my god! He’s weeping! He’s weeping! dan —the live show again?  [Laughs.] crosstalk Stuart [Sighs.]  Oh. Okay! So!  Hawk the Slayer , guys!  Elliott : Oh, boy. Uh, well—so maybe, Dan— elliott What do we do? What do we do on this podcast? dan Uh, this is a podcast where we watch a bad movie and we talk about it. Y’know. I mean…  [sort of extends it into a uncertain groan] [Stuart laughs.]  —I always feel bad? That, uh, the concept is baked into the podcast but it’s also prejudging the film? ‘Cause I don’t know what these guys thought of it. But, um, but mostly they’re bad movies. They’re movies that we have been led to believe are not so good. felicia So you don’t, like, do a  Godfather  situation here? Or you’re not, like, watching, y’know— Schindler’s List crosstalk Elliott : Maybe the third one.  Dan : I mean, if— elliott The third  Schindler’s List [Multiple people laugh.]  The direct-to-video one where it’s dogs?  [Felicia laughs.] felicia There was a—really?! elliott [Through laughter]  Yeah! felicia Wow! That’s one that I don’t think people have—I’ll have to look on Rotten Tomatoes! crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. It’s very—very low-rated.  Dan : That’s a real… Schindler’s Twist! crosstalk Stuart : Ohh, shit. So—  Elliott : No. Not a fan.  Dan : What?! What—you’re making a face— dan —as if you were not the person who introduced the idea of a direct-to-video sequel to  Schindler’s List . And yet I—I’m the one who gets, uh, reprimanded. elliott You’re right. Fair point. Fair point. We’re all sinners in this world. Uh— stuart I will say—I think at time of release, this movie was not particularly thought of well by critics? And I think it was a box office bust? crosstalk Stuart : I think it is  [inaudible]  —-yep! I know.  Felicia [Facetiously]  No!  Elliott : This is a movie that came out— elliott —in 1980 and I was curious how well it did. So I looked up on Box Office Mojo by IMDB Pro. Uh, I don’t know why I’m giving them brand name sponsorship. But, uh, the—I looked up domestic box office for 1980 and it was not in the top 68 releases of that year. felicia Wow! elliott That’s as far as the chart goes. Uh— stuart But back in the—back in 1980, they released thousands up on thousands of movies, right? elliott That’s true. That’s true. Uh— felicia They had the drive-in theaters, right? This was, like, number one on Topeka!  [Dan laughs.]  On the west side. crosstalk Elliott [Through laughter]  Oh—not on the east side of Topeka. Oh, no.  Dan [Laughs.]  Oh, wow! It’s weird that they split those—  Felicia : Yeah. I don’t know which  [inaudible]  Topeka’s better, but yeah. dan Split those demos up for the purposes of box office reporting.  [Multiple people laugh.] felicia That’s where—basically where the stars’ families live. elliott [Through laughter]  Yeah. So they all went to see it. Uh, but this movie also—so the movie we’re watching it  Hawk the Slayer . I have a question for Stuart about it in a moment, uh, but first—this actually has a previous  Flop House  connection. In that it was directed by, uh, the director Terry Marcel, whose daughter Kelly Marcel wrote the  Fifty Shades of Grey  movie— crosstalk Elliott : —which we did on this very podcast! So.  Stuart : Oh, wow!  Felicia : Whaaaat?! stuart I can see connections. crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. So.  Felicia : Wait. It was written by— felicia That’s whose—the daughter wrote it and the dad or the mom wrote this movie? elliott No, no. The dad directed this movie. And also I think— felicia Directed the movie. Okay. elliott He may have cowritten it. Let’s see. Let me take a look. stuart Yeah. He did. elliott Yeah. It’s—and he cowrote it and wrote and directed it and then his daughter went on to become a screenwriter as well. felicia So it’s a schlock legacy! elliott Oh, yes. Oh, very much so. It’s, uh, a proud family tradition? I guess is what you’d call it? Now—Stuart, my question for you is— Hawk the Slayer , you were very big on—we asked Felicia, what kind of movie would you like to do? And she said, “Fantasy, please!” And Stuart said “ HAWK THE SLAYER”  in big capital letters in the text. Now what was it about this movie that really had you going? stuart So there is, uh, y’know, I have a couple of connections to  Hawk the Slayer . Uh, it’s mentioned in the first season of  Spaced ? Y’know, the Edgar Wright show? And I remember being, like, “What the fuck are they talking about?” So I had to look it up.  [Dan laughs.] crosstalk Dan : Angrily.  Stuart : And then, uh…  [Elliott laughs.] stuart I used to—when I worked for—uh, yeah. I was really mad at the show.  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.]  Uh, I turned my TV to face the wall!  [Laughs.]  And, uh, when I worked for Games Workshop I had some, uh, English coworkers who were, uh, big fantasy nerds and they also—y’know, they were fans of  Hawk the Slayer  for some reason. Uh, and then the third reason I mentioned it is the exact day you texted me, uh, somebody told me their brother suggested we should do  Hawk the Slayer  for the show.  [Laughs.] ahHh crosstalk Dan : Mm.  Elliott : Wow.  Stuart : And I thought it would be like—  Felicia : Thank you, random person’s brother! Thank you!  Stuart : Yeah, exactly!  [Elliott laughs.] stuart I feel like… I mean, he’s probably gonna listen now. But I feel like I wanted to be surprised and be, like, “Oh my god!” Like, by mentioning it to this other person and then mentioning—y’know. Like, that his game of telephone actually paid off. crosstalk Dan : Yeah.  Elliott : Mm-hm. elliott He’s like, “What kind of power do I have that I spoke it and it came into being?” dan Now… on a similar line of questioning, this is—with some big exceptions—fantasy is not necessarily my genre. But… uh… Felicia, I know that, uh, I mean, one of your first ways of coming to prominence was  The Guild . Is it—and you said fantasy. Is it something that you particularly connect with? felicia Oh, yeah. I live in another world.  [Multiple people laugh.]  My life is a fantasy.  [Multiple people laugh.]  I have read every fantasy novel there is. I have watched most things that are fantasy-based. I even watched the  Shannara  show for a while. And that was—that was wretched. So—  [Dan laughs.]  I will—anything with a sword or a drape—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —or a horse or a turret. I’m willing—I’m like a sucker. I’ll watch a little bit of anything. I am a turret whore.  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.]  So like… and I know a lot about history? So I realize it is just a fictional account… like, it’s literally like if people wrote about our time and it was like  The Jetsons . Y’know? Like—it’s so far removed from reality? Uh, that we’ve created a fictitious universe that is this chivalrous sort of time where women were so happy—  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.]  Terrible. There weren’t dead bodies everywhere. Everyone didn’t stink. But at the same time I love it and that’s my—it’s sort of like a fairy tale sort of thing. So yeah. I—I have watched a lot of—but I did not watch this movie! And thank god for the introduction to it. Thank god, Stuart. stuart Oh, you’re welcome.  [Dan laughs.] elliott I think, uh, we’re gonna have an interesting dynamic here, uh, between those of us who probably enjoyed the movie and those of us who did not enjoy the movie, as one cohost who will be named later texted me multiple times while watching it with his disgruntlement. It wasn’t Stuart!  [Multiple people laugh.]  But we’ll get to that. Let’s talk about— crosstalk Dan [Through laughter]  Okay.  Stuart : Listeners— stuart Listeners, write in!  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Write in with your guesses! Stop the podcast right now. Write in with your guesses. Write, “Was it Dan? Care of Dan McCoy. 123 Any Street, New York City, Brooklyn, uh, 10111111111111111 USA.”  [Multiple people laugh.]  Uh, “Earth, America.” dan I don’t want to give too many spoilers too early. I will say it’s not so much dislike as… boredom. But we’ll get to it. felicia Mm-hm. Mm-hm. elliott Right. Interesting. Well, let’s talk about  Hawk the —let’s talk about the hawk. Which is, I guess, probably should’ve been the slogan on the poster? ‘Cause the slogan on the poster says, uh, “Beyond the edge of darkness, there’s a world of sword and sorcery.” But it should’ve been, “You’re gonna talk about the Hawk.” crosstalk Elliott : That should’ve been the slogan, I think.  Felicia : Yeah.  Stuart : I figured it would be like— stuart “Can you talk the Hawk or will you hawk the talk?”  [Elliott laughs.] elliott [Through laughter]  Exactly. felicia That’s even better. That’s even better, dude.  [Dan laughs.] elliott Yeah. Uh, “Some people walk the walk. This guy talks the Hawk.” crosstalk Felicia [Through laughter]  Talks to—  [Laughs.] Elliott : And people are like—  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott —“Wait. So he talks to hawks?” “No, no, no, no, no. That’s not what it’s about.” felicia And with  Ladyhawke  coming out, I think that was probably later. That totally owes all of it—all the hawk-dom— crosstalk Felicia : —is owed to—this.  Stuart : Uh-huh. And then—and then the third movie in the trilogy, uh,  Hudson Hawk crosstalk Elliott : Yeah! Exactly!  Felicia ! Exactly! Exactly! felicia It was just, uh, a generation of hawk-dom. And this was really the—the bird of the decade. crosstalk Dan Look Who’s Hawking; Look Who’s Hawking 2 Elliott : Yeah. In the ‘80s? People—people loved hawk—  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] elliott That was the story about a baby who got into falconry, right? dan [Through laughter]  Mm-hm. elliott And the baby was holding like a little glove with a little baby falcon on it? Which—  [Dan laughs.]  —now that I think about it, is kind of the plot of  Kes  which is a terribly sad movie. Okay. So.  Hawk the Slayer . We open with an opening title that has some kind of epic myth stuff that, y’know, just say basic stuff. We don’t need to get into it. I didn’t write it down. Uh, because quickly we are introduced to the villain of the piece—that’s right—Voltan the Dark One! Jack Palance wearing a helmet that covers half his face because they—I guess—didn’t have the makeup budget for his heavily-scarred face to be onscreen for more than a, y’know, the minute at the end of the movie. Uh, Voltan is infiltrating a castle. He wants his dad’s secret, ancient power. And how would you describe the room that his dad is in?  [Felicia laughs.] felicia It’s probably where Trump takes a poop.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Yeah! That’s a great—yeah! It’s got gold—shiny gold walls, and there seems to be some kind of dry ice hot tub just in the middle with like gold statues over it?  [Dan laughs.] felicia I love this more than anything int his scene? Is the two—there’s two sort of gargoyles on either side of the hot tub? And they have this look like… they’re a kid from 1980 doing a headshot?  [Multiple people laugh.]  It’s like that cute… it’s the cute little two fists under the chin going, “Heyyyy!”  [Multiple people laugh.]  So I actually re-watched the whole sequence just looking at the gargoyles’ face. elliott It feels so much like they wanted a creepy gargoyle but all they could get was like little angel statues? And they were just like, “Paint ‘em gold. Stick ‘em on the hot tub. What are ya gonna do? Come on.” stuart Yeah. I, uh, this is the kind of room that if I was, uh, playing a game of  True Dungeon  and this was the last chamber, I would not be super bummed about it? But I wouldn’t be very happy.  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] felicia I’ve done  True Dungeon . That’s amazing. crosstalk Felicia : That’s a good reference, too.  Stuart : I figured somebody would appreciate it.  [Laughs.] felicia Ten people and me!  [Dan laughs.] elliott Not me, Stuart! Thumbs down to that reference! Not in my wheelhouse! stuart So Voltan is fighting his dad. Right? And they look roughly two years apart.  [Dan laughs.] elliott And Voltan seems older than his dad. And now this is— felicia Yep. elliott I think the main issue with casting Jack Palance as your villain but then deciding that the villain and the hero should be brothers. Because Jack Palance by this time—let’s see—this is 1980. He was 61 years old at the time. And— dan Oh my!  [Stuart laughs.] elliott He is—and, uh, you do not want a 61-year-old hero. Uh, and so you end up with some very old brothers. He looks to be about—a little bit older than his dad. And uh, he wants the secret to ancient power. Uh, and his dad is like—“No way!” And while he’s arguing with his dad, Hawk is—is this when Hawk—one of the times when Hawk is riding on his horse for a very long time? felicia Yeah. It’s like, exterior darkness. Interior light. He’s—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —So he’s, like, two time zones over but somehow just arrives. It’s amazing. I’m like, “What? Why is the castle in midnight and then he’s, like, it’s golden hour.”  [Dan laughs.]  It didn’t make any sense. elliott No. It’s—and, uh, they do—I don’t remember if they do it here, but they do—a number of times, Hawk will be riding on his horse and they will just cross-dissolve to him riding on his horse and then they will half-dissolve.  [Stuart laughs.]  Him riding on his horse with the image of him riding on his horse. And it’s like—it felt like they were—they really wanted to make the most of this Hawk, uh, riding horses footage. felicia Hawk on—but there’s always a lizard watching him. crosstalk Felicia : You notice that?  Elliott : Yeah! A lizard or a snake! Yeah!  [Laughs.] felicia And there’s a disco! It’s disco lizard! So basically disco lizard watches Hawk ride through the woods!  [Multiple people laugh.] dan As long as we’re talking about Hawk riding through the woods—which is approximately 90% of the movie—I also would like to say that every exterior in this movie is, uh, a patch of the woods that basically looks like the other patch of the woods we just saw? With, uh, about, like, let’s say ten smoke machines on overdrive making this in the background. elliott And often Halloween adventure skulls.  [Stuart laughs.]  Just tied to trees. felicia Yep. Yep. elliott There’s so many bones tied to trees in this movie! But anyway. Hawk shows up. Uh, Hawk bursts in—too late! The dad is dying. Voltan… left? I guess? And the old man gives Hawk his magic stone that he kept in an amulet around his neck. Voltan couldn’t crack that code. But maybe— felicia Or—  [Laughs.]  He couldn’t get the sword off the wall, either! He didn’t really try. He just was like—  [Stuart laughs.]  —dad, you’re dead. I’m outta here.  [Dan laughs.] elliott [Laughs.]  Uh, and the stone goes into the—so the handle of the sword—which is called the Mindsword for reasons that are never really explained. I guess ‘cause you can control it with your mind. It’s a hand and the hand opens up and holds this glowing stone and his dad is like, “Now you’ve got the power. And… you’re gonna use this.” And Hawk wills the sword to his hand and it floats over. And that’s when—  [Dan laughs.]  —we get the title:  Hawk the Slayer —drawn by hand!—as if it is the first bootleg, like—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —EP release of a heavy metal—of, like, a hometown heavy metal band. And it is copyright Chips Productions, which is maybe— crosstalk Elliott [Through laughter]  —my favorite thing that I’ve ever seen?  [Laughs.] Felicia : Yeah! That was my favorite! I was like, chips! felicia [Inaudible]  This is—did they do  Chips  later?  [Dan laughs.]  Or is this just kind of like their side project? crosstalk Elliott : And this is an English—  Felicia : Or is Erik Estrada? elliott This is an English movie so that means it’s copyright French Fries productions. Which is even better.  [Multiple people laugh.]  Um, and I’m gonna go out on a limb right now. I mean, the instant this movie started I was like—“Movie, I’m totally yours.” But then when the theme song started playing I—  [Stuart and Felicia agree.]  —the music is genuinely—is amazing. It’s—it’s— felicia No, no. The music—I actually would—I would listen to the soundtrack. crosstalk Elliott : Yeah.  Dan : I looked up—  Felicia : It is genuinely amazing. It’s disco…tech? Somehow? It should be like— TRON felicia Y’know? Like, it’s not… it’s not appropriate for anything that’s onscreen. crosstalk Felicia : It’s really quite good!  Dan : I tried to—  Elliott : No. dan Yeah. I tried to see whether it was available for purchase, actually. I mean, you can get it as MP3s but not in any other format. But I was like—yeah! It’s like, disco, uh, some of it sounds like the Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade?  [Multiple people laugh.]  Some of it sounds like Ennio Morricone. Like, it’s way different than anything you, like, would see in a modern fantasy film. Or hear. stuart The Morricone comment’s interesting ‘cause I think, uh… reading up on the trivia behind it, I guess they were trying to go for like—they were trying to go for like a Western but set in a—like, a fantasy sword & sorcery realm? And then like— felicia That was clear. That was clear with the long, expressionless closeups they kept cutting back and forth.  [Stuart laughs.]  I’m like, “Are they trying to do a Spaghetti Western? With like—” and I was like “Wow, that would’ve been cool had it worked in any way.”  [Dan laughs.] elliott Yeah. The ways—the only way it works is the music and when they show people shooting crossbows and they—and it’s just like— crosstalk Felicia : Oh, it’s amazing! It’s my favorite thing in the world! It’s my favorite thing in the world—  Elliott : Yeah, those are fantastic. Yeah.  [Dan laughs.] felicia —those crossbows. ‘Cause they’re machine-gun crossbows! elliott Oh yeah. And it’s just them showing the same piece of footage over—like, cut really close together. And when—I’ve never seen an elf shoot arrows so fast. Sorry, Legolas. felicia Oh no. I was like, “Why does anyone have a sword in this world? You should all be using machine-gun arrows or crossbows! Like, they—” I’m like, “Nobody can hold a candle to this one-handed crossbow artist over here!” crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. He’s amazing.  Dan : Well that’s one way in which this fantasy medieval world is better than the real world. dan Is there’s a waiting period for crossbows in this universe. crosstalk Elliott : Oh, I see. Okay. They closed that loophole. That bolt-hole.  Felicia : Ahhh.  Stuart : Oh, okay. Yeah. That makes sense.  Dan : Yeah. elliott Uh, so the, uh, so anyway. There’s, uh, a guy with a crossbow. And his one arm is wounded grievously. He goes to a convent and he’s like, “I’m from a village and Voltan destroyed it. They were laughing!” crosstalk Elliott : And they amputate his hand.  Stuart : A convent that is a very cool map painting. stuart I think we can all agree. Right? crosstalk Felicia : It is. It was pretty cool. Yeah.  Elliott : Oh. Sure. Yeah. elliott And this man is Ranulf. And for a while you’d be mistaken in thinking that he’s the hero of the movie, because it takes a long time for Hawk to come back. For a while this is the adventures of Ranulf looking for Hawk. Uh— felicia Which, by the way—better actor. crosstalk Elliott : Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. He uh—  Dan : Yeah. Well I wanted to say earlier—  Stuart : Yeah. dan —when Elliott was talking about the problem with Jack Palance being the brother. The other problem is—as many years older Jack Palance is? That’s how much more charismatic Jack Palance also is. The Hawk is kind of blank. elliott I mean, by the time this movie came out, Jack Palance had been in movie for roughly forty years? Like—  [Stuart laughs.]  —there’s a reason he lasted that long! crosstalk Elliott : Because he’s got a—he’s got a—  Dan : Look, man. I’m not— elliott ‘Cause he’s super charismatic and he’s got a creepy face! Uh—  [Dan laughs.]  So Voltan, meanwhile, he’s—his face gives him such pain that he has to go to this kind of weird, dark, wizard god who talks through an audio, uh, filtered voice. And who uses— stuart It’s awesome. elliott —light finger lasers to cure him of his pain temporarily. And this is another moment where I was like, “Yes, movie. Thank you. Yes.”  [Laughs.] felicia No. it’s amazing. It’s like the most janky lasiks I’ve ever seen in my life.  [Multiple people laugh.]  He’s screaming and it still doesn’t work! And I’m just like, “What are you doing?! You—put some anesthetic on there, man!” crosstalk Stuart : Yeah. Price of beauty, you know?  [Dan laughs.] Elliott : And they never—they never really explain—  Felicia : Yeah. elliott They never really explain what dimension this wizard is in or how he gets there? He’ll just be talking to his men and go, “I have to go. My face is in pain!” And then he’s suddenly in this kind of… red dimension. Where this wizard hangs out waiting to shoot lasers into his face from his fingers. It’s, oh. It’s so—uh— crosstalk Elliott : But the wizard-  Felicia : It reminds me of, like— felicia —a sound bass person in  Silver Lake . You know what I’m saying? It’s like—totally unaccredited. He has this belief that it’s gonna fix him—  [Elliott laughs.]  —and that belief and cash—a cash money payment is really gonna cure him. elliott Mm-hm. Mm-hm. He’s like, “Well I could go with what “Western” medicine says—\"  [Felicia laughs.]  —with a lot of quotes around it. “But I think the harmonics are what’s really gonna take the infection out of my face.” Uh, so this—this dark—I was calling him a dark god, but later they refer to him as a wizard. Uh, he’s like, “You have to go to this convent. Uh, and do something to lure Hawk out.” Uh, so Voltan and his son—whose name is Drogo—uh—  [Multiple people laugh.]  They go to—uh—although later on it’s revealed that he’s an adopted son. Uh, they go to this convent and he and his son kidnap the head nun for ransom. And they say, “We’re gonna ransom this.” And then just to make it—make the threat super clear, Voltan cuts a loaf of bread in half with his sword, which gets its own shot. Which was—  [Dan laughs.] felicia It’s a ciabatta—it’s my favorite shot! It’s a ciabatta! Y’know? Like—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —it’s one of those, like, it’s a very—either a hamburger bun? A large hamburger—  [Multiple people laugh.]  It’s like—you know what it is? It’s a Schlotzsky’s bun. crosstalk Felicia : Have you ever heard of Schlotzsky’s? Yeah. So he literally—  Elliott : Yeah, yeah.  Stuart : Yep. That’s actually—  [Dan laughs.] stuart That’s actually the kind of roll that we’re using for our sandwiches at my bar Hinterlands, which is now open for to-go service. Oh, so interesting and delicious!  [Elliott laughs.] crosstalk Dan : I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Stuart. You have to—  Felicia : Wow. Sponsored by. dan You have to buy a Jumbotron for that kind of, uh, business message.  [Felicia laughs.] stuart Why? I’m just talking!  [Multiple people laugh.] felicia Listen. If you cut it with your broadsword like that, I’m there. I need to see a broadsword cut and I’ll take that away.  [Stuart laughs.] elliott I mean, I have to assume it’s free if the customer will chop it in half with a broadsword. Right, Stu? felicia No, that’s kind of like a Gyu-Kaku, y’know? You gotta—you gotta cook your own—you gotta cook your own beef, and then at this place you gotta cut your own ciabatta! With a broadsword!  [Dan laughs.] elliott Not a fan of those. stuart I’ll hold the ciabatta and then you’ll carefully cut it in half using your broadsword.  [Dan laughs.] elliott Uh, I don’t know if— crosstalk Elliott : Maybe you should just want to put it on a table.  Stuart : It will probably require… stuart —rolling a critical hit. Probably.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott [Through laughter]  Probably. crosstalk Dan : Now what kind of armor class is on that, uh, sandwich?  Elliott : Is on the bread?  [Laughs.] Stuart : Look, dude. felicia Ciabatta has a five—five? Or maybe—it has a very good saving throw. Dexterity saving throw. It’s a real bouncy ciabatta.  [Multiple people laugh.] stuart [Through laughter]  Yeah. elliott So, uh—so Ranulf, the crossbow guy, he reports to the, uh, to the abbot. Uh, and the abbot, he’s like, “Hey. I was at—I happened to be at this convent and this—and the head nun got kidnapped. What do I do? I’m just a guy with one hand and a magic machine crossbow.”  [Dan laughs.]  And the abbot says, “Get Hawk. He’s done work for us before.” felicia And that sequence I remember because the abbot was on fire the whole time. Like, they shot him in a way that there was a fire underneath him the whole time? So he looked like he was literally standing in a fire the whole time. Which looked uncomfortable. stuart And he’s like, “You need to find this one man. And his name is…  [enunciating dramatically]  Hawk.” felicia Hawk! stuart And then that’s when I raised my fist in the air. I put down the Warhammer miniatures I was painting—  [Elliott laughs.]  —and I put my fists in the air and starting chanting “Hawk!” over and over. crosstalk Dan : Mm-hm.  Elliott . Yeah. elliott Hawk! Hawk! Hawk! Just like in  The Mighty Ducks , but “Hawk” instead of “quack.” Uh, I will mention that the high abbot? Uh, is played by the actor Harry Andrews, who was in a very great movie called  The Hill  with Sean Connery, so it’s a much better movie than this. Uh, but this is a—this is pretty fun. It’s less fun than this but it’s better. Anyway. Hawk— dan There’s some, uh, great British character actors that show up and I hope we highlight them as they— crosstalk Elliott : Oh, we will!  Dan : —as they come. elliott When the innkeeper showed up and I was like, “I know that innkeeper!” Uh, we’ll get to him for sure. Uh, and speaking of great British actors that we’re gonna highlight… Hawk is riding through the woods for a while. It’s not time for the main adventure. Time for a little introductory quest. A woman is about to be burned by two brigands at the stake as a witch. And this is something Hawk does a lot, which is ride through the woods ‘til he comes across an injustice and then kill all the bad guys. Uh, and he managed— crosstalk Elliott : He has—  Felicia : They murder— felicia —a lot of people for being “good guys,” quote-unquote. There’s a lot of murder. crosstalk Felicia : Civilian murder.  Dan : Yeah.  Elliott : It’s—it’s— elliott Tons of murder. And something that I wasn’t ready for but which I found kind of refreshing was how stern and humorless Hawk is. I’m so used to, like, your Chris Pratt or like, um, y’know, Robert Downey, Jr. type heroes in these big movies now these days. To have a hero who is so incredibly humorless and just is like,  [monotonous voice]  “Yes. Well. Stop that or I’ll kill you. Okay? Killing you now. Hm. We’re not paying the ransom. It wouldn’t be worth it. Voltan must die.”  [Regular voice]  It was like, “Wow. This guy’s not even trying to entertain!” dan Especially considering he has that cool, like, Han Solo kind of vest that he wears around. That, uh— stuart And guys? Do you think—do you think I’d look cool if I had a Hawk the Slayer haircut?  [Dan laughs.] felicia Oh, boy! It’s like—it was like a bowl was put on the front to get the bangs and then it’s a party in the back. crosstalk Stuart : Uh-huh. Yup.  Elliott : Mm-hm. A hawk party.  Dan : Mm-hm. stuart Well when I go—yeah. When I go to my stylist I’ll say—okay. First, put a bowl on my head. Now—  [Felicia laughs.]  —push it back a little bit.  [Multiple people laugh.] felicia Yeah. It needs to be a super high bang line. Like—ugh. dan No. Take the soup out first. stuart Mm-hm. elliott Or don’t, if that’s the secret! dan Mm-hm. crosstalk Dan : To what? Silky hair?  Elliott : To styling? Yeah. elliott To soft, silky hair is minestrone?  [Dan laughs.]  Uh, so he’s gonna say—there’s a long stare-down. Very long stare-down. That’s where that Spaghetti Western aspect comes in. Between Hawk and this bad guy. Then there’s a swordfight and he saves this witch. This witch is played by—Patricia Quinn. That’s right! From  I, Claudius . Did I interview her on the MaxFun podcast  I, Podius ? Yes I did! So that’s another little connection.  I, Claudius ’s Patricia Quinn playing here the blind witch who can see all and has magic hula hoops later in. crosstalk Elliott : So that’s  I, Podius , hosted by me and John Hodgman on Maximum Fun.  I, Podius , wherever podcasts are sold.  Stuart : And—and she’s—and she’s—  Dan : Wow. A lotta unpaid-for advertisements here. dan Hey, um, which—who was she in  I, Claudius elliott She was Livilla. She was the, uh, she was the one who… was in love with Sejanus, Patrick Stewart’s character. And, uh, and goes crazy with evil. Uh, and is—gets her comeuppance. But she’s really great in it. stuart Just like, uh, when she was Magenta in  Rocky Horror Picture Show , right? elliott Yes. I guess most people would know her as Magenta in  Rocky Horror Picture Show . Sure. But uh… but I don’t have a podcast to promote off of that. Whereas—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —she did play— felicia Well, next year. elliott —Livilla, where I interviewed her. Uh, so the witch is like, “Hey. Someone’s looking for you. Uh, I know these things cause I’m—even though I told these guys I’m not a witch and I was just trying to cure their pig, I am actually a witch.” Uh, he rides through the woods for a while past a lotta bones. There’s a lot of half-dissolves, like said. And finally… Ranulf is—has had a run-in with some brigands and they’re about to kill him with a— crosstalk Elliott : —hatchet-throwing competition.  Stuart : It’s lousy— stuart It’s lousy with brigands around these parts, right?  [Dan laughs.] elliott It was a dark time. Where the woods were full of brigands and there were no towns or villages? Later on they go to a blacksmith who just seems to have a stall in the middle of the woods? felicia The middle of the woods, yeah. I think they shot in one half-acre.  [Multiple people laugh.]  And they just kind of twirled the camera around. Twirled it around. crosstalk Elliott : They were like—  Stuart : It’s the sort of thing where you like— stuart You toggle onto your map and then you’re like, I guess I’ll put a fucking waypoint out here?  [Multiple people laugh.]  Not near a town. Can I fast-travel? Off of that bone?  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott So—  [Laughs.]  What—wow. I guess I’ll check in on Foursquare at “Tree With Bone Next to It.”  [All laugh.]  That’s the business now! He saves Ranulf and Ranulf is like, “Oh, you’re Hawk! I’ve been looking for you. I’ve got a mission for you.” Meanwhile, uh, Voltan is terrorizing a bunch of people. I think this is the scene where, uh, his son calls a guy a dork? Which—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —I thought was hilarious  [through laughter]  for a fantasy—for— felicia It was amazing! It was amazing! elliott Uh, this is—they’re, uh, angering some guys, uh, at an inn. And the innkeeper—I was like, “I know that guy!” And I looked it up and that’s the actor Roy Kinnear, best known as Veruca Salt’s dad from _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factor_y— felicia Oh, wow! That’s where I recognized him from! I recognize a lot of these people, but I didn’t really know. They’re those kind of character actors you’re like, “Oh, I saw that face but I don’t really know what their name is.” elliott Yeah. He was in a lot of stuff but that’s the thing I know him best from, certainly. dan Yeah. I was gonna say, that’s definitely the big one people—especially of our age—would know him from. But he also, was uh, in  Help! , uh, the Beatles film. So. elliott Yeah. Now would you call that the Beatles’ best film? dan Uh, no. I would not. But it’s pretty good! crosstalk Dan : Y’know, it is overshadowed—it is overshadowed by the fact that—  Elliott : Okay. Good—I mean, it is—it’s pretty racist! dan A Hard Day’s Night  is a masterpiece, but  Help!  has a lot of funny stuff in it. elliott Help!  is fairly racist, as I learned when I was re-watching it with Sammy recently. I was like… I was like, “Oh, there’s a lot of English people playing Indian assassins in this!” But, uh, y’know. dan That’s true. Although it does have Leo McKern, TV’s “Rumpole” in it, which, uh, is wonderful to see. elliott Mm, I know him best as “Number Two.” From  The Prisoner . But uh, or one of many Number Twos. But, uh, anyway. So—  [Dan laughs.]  So Voltan really terrorizes Veruca Salt’s dad and they kill some people. And Voltan—it’s unclear what his power is. He—at first he seems to be kind of like the dark lord who rules over this land, but other times he has to keep introducing himself to strangers and threatening them to like get them to respect him. So it’s—there’re two people eating and Drogo is like, “Stop eating and stand when Voltan is here!” And they’re like, “Who? I’m eating right now!”  [Multiple people laugh.]  And we—and— stuart I hate it when that happens. elliott They mention that they’re slavers. And it’ll come in later. So that’s good foreshadowing. Uh—we have a flashback to Hawk’s wedding day. Uh— felicia Which looks like a douche commercial.  [Multiple people laugh.]  Full-on douche commercial. It’s white. There’s, like, this very badly makeup—the woman has the worst makeup I’ve ever seen in my life. It’s like a child got, like, an eyelash—eyeshadow palette and just smeared it on her face. It’s really bad. I feel bad for this actress. elliott Uh, that actress is Catriona MacColl. Who, uh, was in a bunch of like Lucio Fulci movies? She was in a lot of Italian horror movies. Uh— felicia Oh, cool! elliott And so—but it’s—she doesn’t get much to do here. Uh, other than to, uh, profess her undying love to Hawk. Although apparently she used to be Voltan’s girlfriend? crosstalk Stuart : I love it so much!  Elliott : And this is—  Felicia : Yeah.  [Dan laughs.] stuart She’s like, “Oh, we’re just friends, dude!”  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] felicia Yeah! She totally friendzones Voltan in this scene! And it’s like—I married your brother.  [Dan laughs.] stuart He’s complaining that while he was at war his younger brother was, uh, y’know, like, using his silver tongue. But I’m like, “I don’t know, dude. You’re really old and look like a skeleton.”  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott It’s like—I wanted Hawk to be, like, “Wait, you mean your daughter, right? Like, I’m marrying your daughter?”  [Dan laughs.]  But, uh, the—I mean they—so, uh—Voltan is like, “Hey, Lady Eliane was supposed to be mine!” And it’s weird to bring that up on the wedding day. You’d think he’d bring it up before the actual day of the wedding. Uh, she—uh, Voltan runs off after saying she should be his, and she gives Hawk a little charm for protection. Which is a—kind of like, what, Celtic cross almost? felicia Mm-hm. elliott And we’ll find— felicia But it does come into play later. It is—like, somebody did some work on the screenplay! ‘Cause it’s like, oh, that plays in later! Much later! But it does. elliott Everything they plant has a payoff. Mostly. stuart [Through laughter]  Yup.  [Dan laughs.] elliott Uh, they travel through, uh—anyway. Hawk and, uh, and Ranulf, they go—he’s like, “We’re gonna have to travel through the haunted forest of Weir to get my compatriots for our fighting party.” Uh, and it’s fine. It’s just like—it’s like they’re riding on horseback through like a haunted house forest ‘cause like, little muppet— crosstalk Elliott : —puppet mole people pop out.  Felicia : There’s a little toad that looks like Baby Yoda— felicia —did a lot of meth? And it just keeps popping up and—as a puppet? Like, they cut to this little Baby Yoda meth kid and then they’re out of it. It takes like five seconds for them to go to this—through this haunted house woods, which I love more than anything.  [Elliott laughs.] elliott It really—the buildup for the haunted house woods, I think, takes almost as much time as the actual haunted house woods. And they never get off their horses and it’s almost—he’s like, “I hope you’re not afraid of being looked at by a gross puppet. ‘Cause—”  [Multiple people laugh.]  “—that’s what we’re about to experience.” stuart [Through laughter]  There’s only one puppet but we’re gonna show it a lotta times in different parts of the woods.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott And, uh, they—at the—when they’re  [inaudible]  out of the forest, they’re back to the witch. Uh, kind of—I don’t know why they had to take so much time to get to her? Uh, and she takes them to her magic cave. Where she’s gonna transport, uh, Hawk to get each of the members of his, uh, fighting party. His old buddies. Now, how—which of you guys wants to describe her method of teleportation? What it looks like and how it works? dan Is that the two spinning, uh… hula hoops? crosstalk Elliott : Yes. It is.  Felicia : Yeah. Magic hula hoop magic.  Stuart : Mm-hm. dan Yeah. They’re spinning sort of like—imagine like one hula hoop when it stops spinning, like, on the ground and is kinda like going around on its, uh, on its edges sort of gyroscope style? Like, now put two of ‘em together to— crosstalk Dan : —on top of each other.  Felicia : And they make it, like, neon colors. crosstalk Felicia : ‘Cause that’s completely appropriate for medieval kind of world.  Stuart : Well I think—I think neon is the color palette— stuart —of magic in this movie, as you’ll see. Like in the big climax. crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. Uh—so the—and—  Felicia : Mm-hm!  Dan : Magic looks a lot like stormtrooper, uh, lasers in this movie.  [Stuart laughs.] elliott Or—alternately—it looks like someone is throwing glowing bouncy balls through a door—  [Multiple people laugh.]  —from off-camera! Uh, it’s—the hula hoop magic—the hula hoop magic looks like—if you had a science museum for kids where they’re like, “Inertia can keep this hula hoop standing up! As long as it’s moving.” That’s what it reminded me of. Okay. So, uh, she send them individually to get each of the three members of the party. There is Gort, a giant. Uh, who’s pretty tall, I guess. He’s not, like… giant-giant. stuart And he’s played by the guy who played the Cyclops in  Crawl elliott Is it the same guy? crosstalk Felicia : Ohhhh! Wow!  Stuart : Yup. Yup. felicia That guy’s been in some awesome stuff! stuart [Through laughter]  Yup. elliott And, uh, so he is—and we meet him as he is fixing a merchant’s wagon, and then the merchant won’t pay him. So he breaks the merchant’s wagon wheel again. And he carries a big hammer that I think is supposed to look heavy but it’s—y’know, it’s very clearly made out of a very light balsa-y material.  [Dan laughs.]  And Hawk shows up and is like, “Hey. Come with me. We got an adventure.” And they—and he—wait. But he kills a bunch of people, too! The giant, right? felicia Yeah. There’s a lot of just murder and it’s like, “Let’s go be good guys!” Like, it just—  [Elliott laughs.]  —sequence after sequence, just civilians and brigands who are mildly, maybe, chaotic neutral?  [Elliott laughs.]  But they’re dead. They die. stuart Yeah. There’s a feeling of like… after a couple of situations, you’re like, “I think you’re looking for fights, guys.” Like, “I think you’re trying to make this happen.”  [Laughs.] elliott Yeah. This is—they’re not—they’re certainly not de-escalating. That’s for sure.  [Dan laughs.] felicia Nope. elliott Uh, there’s a point where Voltan is kind of the lesser of two evils. Where you’re like, “Okay, I guess Hawk is mildly better.” But then he goes to my favorite member of the group—that’s right!—it’s Crow, which Wikipedia describes as “A reticent elf.”  [Multiple people laugh.]  So reticent. He wears kind of like a stitched-together, leather, red hoodie—or, like, cloak— felicia It looks like pepperoni. Or maybe—  [Elliott laughs.]  —the inside of a skinned human. I can’t tell. It’s the most repulsive texture on his armor. And I just love it. I love it. And he is my favorite character ever. elliott He is so—they’re clearly going for, like, last of his kind, uh… brooding figure? But mainly what he does—he sits there and he examines arrow points he’s just had made for a long time. He is challenged to an archery contest, which—duh—he wins. But he’s just—he’s a super-fast bowman. Hanging out at the forest blacksmith, uh, just looking—he’s like the kid who hangs out at the skate shop? Just looking at the new boards? stuart Now, is that more of a blacksmith or a guy who makes bows? crosstalk Stuart : That’s more of like—a bow-ier?  Elliott : You’re right. He’s probably a fletcher. stuart A bow—no. A fletcher makes arrows. elliott But he’s making arrows. He’s give—he’s make— crosstalk Felicia : He’s making arrowheads. Yeah. And then it—  Elliott : He is making arrowheads.  Stuart : Oh, okay. But somebody who makes bows is what—a—bowier? Bowsia?  Dan : Now—  Felicia : A bow—a bowier. A bowier? A boughier? Chad Boseman. Yeah.  Elliott : A Chadwick Boseman.  Dan : And this—this raises a good point. dan Which is—did Jessica Fletcher make arrows? stuart Mm-hm. elliott Very good question, and yes, that’s what she murdered people with.  [Dan laughs.]  And then she’d write about it. Yeah. No, that’s—I knew—I worked with someone once and they had two children named, uh, Piper and Cooper. And they were having a third child and I so wanted them to name them Fletcher so all their children would be named after medieval tradecraft. But.  [Dan laughs.]  They did not. Disappointing. stuart Wheelwright?  [Laughs.] elliott [Through laughter]  Yeah! dan [Through laughter]  That famous surname, “Wheelwright.”  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Uh, he wins this archery contest. Uh, nobody, I think is—oh, no. One person is killed. Uh, and— felicia Yup. Yeah. elliott Hawk comes by and they’re trying to hustle this elf and it’s like, dude. Don’t try to hustle an elf wearing a pepperoni hoodie? For—y’know, an archery contest?  [Dan laughs.]  Like, that goes without saying. The minute he pulls back his hood and you see his elf ears, you should be like, “Oh, I’m sorry, sir. I don’t wanna trouble you.” dan Just like Vizzini said—that’s one of the classic blunders.  [Laughs.] elliott [Laughs.]  And the final member of the group is Baldin, a jokey dwarf who we see—who is—he’s about to be sacrificed in a Viking funeral pyre, uh, by this— felicia By Hare Krishnas. Right? elliott Yeah. By this kind of Hare Krishna-y cult. And uh, he gets saved. His—his special ability is he has a whip, which he used—does not use to save himself. Hawk saves himself. Instead, he whips a fish out of the river and then eats it whole. Just sticks it in his mouth. felicia Eats it whole! He eats a—I mean, it’s really the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen an actor do.  [Multiple people laugh.]  This dwarf actor whip the water, take a whole cod or whatever. Trout. And just like a dolphin, eat it. I was just like, wow!  [Elliott laughs.]  There’s no point at which—in this movie I can calm down. ‘Cause I’m always surprised by something that happens.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Oh, yeah. It’s—you have to be, like, “So does he have his teeth in his throat? Like, what’s going on?” Or is it like when Heathcliff would take a whole fish and put it in his mouth and then pull the bones out? stuart It was like, in his audition they’re like, “Uh, I see that you can’t—you didn’t list ‘stage combat.’ Do you have any other skills that might be useful for this role?”  [Elliott laughs.]  And he’s like, “Funny you should ask!” crosstalk Stuart : And he pulls a fish out?  Dan [Through laughter]  He’s like—“You may see that I—\" dan “I brought a cooler with me today.”  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Um, the five heroes, they’ve been assembled. They’re all, uh, Patricia Quinn got them all together. And she’s like, “Well, they only paid me for so much time in this movie. I’ll be back later. Time for you to go to the convent!” They go to the convent to find out what the mission is. They’ve gotta save the head abbess. Uh, there’s another flashback in which Eliane dies saving Hawk from Voltan. Voltan throws, what, a dagger at him? And she gets in the way of it? Um… and— stuart I think he shoots her with a crossbow, actually. elliott Oh, right! I forgot. It’s all crossbows, all the time. Uh, it’s just full crossbows. Uh, we get a scene where—very prolonged scene—where the giant is going to eat a whole chicken and the—  [Laughs.] felicia It’s the longest dialogue in the whole scene! crosstalk Elliott : In the whole movie!  Felicia : And it’s the longest— felicia —movie—I was like, “Is this still going on where the dwarf is tricking the—the giant to give him his chicken?” Which is clearly, like, a Cornish hen. And it—but it just did not end! It’s like, this is the—the director thought, “This is the funniest scene we’ve ever done. We’re gonna let them just riff.”  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Well just, people are gonna be talking for years about the dwarf tricking the giant out of his chicken. The chicken trick scene. The famous  Hawk the Slayer  chicken trick scene. And it goes on for a long time. But luckily, the dwarf manages to pull it off and he does eat that chicken and he eats it with just as much grace and elegance as  [through laughter]  he ate that fish earlier.  [Multiple people laugh.]  Um, just shoving it into his face and hoping some of the meat gets to his mouth. Um—  [Stuart laughs.]  They’re like, okay. They—Voltan asked for a ransom. Where are we gonna get the money for this ransom? And the—there’s a nun there who does not like Hawk and his pals. She knows that they’re trouble. Maybe word got to her about how many people they murdered on the way to the convent. But they’re like, “We gotta get some money. And you know what? Maybe we’ll cause some trouble at the same time!” So they go to the river where the slavers are and, uh, kill all these people and free their slaves, which is a bunch of guys in, like, very surprisingly skimpy loincloths. Uh, and for no reason at all they set up—the giant sets up, like, a torture trap for one of the guys? felicia [Laughs.]  Yeah. I was like, “Who is the bad guy here?” They murder 30 people here! They let the slavers go and then they put like a flail over this bad guy’s face and then his head gets crushed in and then they do like a quip! And I’m like, “Are these—do I like these people? Not really!” elliott No. No. They’re tough guys. But it was a tough time. Again. It was a tough time when Voltan was ruling the airwaves and everybody’s—  [Dan laughs.]  —everybody was doing the Hawk. Uh— stuart I do like that the lead slaver guy who we’re introduced to, like, spilling food out of his mouth. Uh, I like that even at the end—even when he’s face-to-face with a giant—he’s like, “I think I could still win.”  [Laughs.] felicia Yeah. He has a lot of pluck, that slaver. elliott So I—I took—only I’m now looking up—‘cause I forgot to look this up earlier—so the man who plays Hawk and Voltan’s father—uh, the actor Ferdy Mayne—he was three years older than Jack Palance. So I was wrong earlier—  [Felicia laughs.]  —when I said Jack Palance looked older. felicia He’s not the oldest person in the movie. Yeah. elliott No, no. When he was three, he had a child. And that child was Jack Palance. And he was in—a surprising number of actors in this movie were in  Barry Lyndon . I guess ‘cause there’s a lot of English actors in  Barry Lyndon crosstalk Elliott : But he was one of them.  Dan : Have we reached the point— dan —also—I’m sorry. I—where, um, the actor who played, uh, Hercule in, um, in  A Shot in the Dark  is in the movie? Uh, as— elliott I don’t remember. Who— dan As an older man. Yeah. Uh, the guy—apparently this actor—I looked him up after that—the fact. Uh, the guy who played Hercule was actually in more  Pink Panther  movies than Peter Sellers, because he was in one of the posthumous  Pink Panther  films? He was a friend of Peter Sellers’ from the old days and he was in makeup for a lot of the other—like, he’s the innkeeper who’s, like, uh, the—“Does your dog bite?” scene? Uh— elliott Oh, okay. crosstalk Felicia : Ohhh!  Elliott : Alright. dan Uh, he’s also in this movie. Yeah. I can’t remember as whom, though. stuart And I think a few of these actors were in episodes of  Doctor Who [Laughs.] crosstalk Felicia : At least.  [Dan laughs.] Elliott : Oh, oh, so— elliott You’re talking about, uh, Graham Stark. dan Yes. elliott Who played Hercule. So he’s—yeah. He plays, uh, a character named Sparrow, who I don’t remember who that is in the movie! Uh… but yeah. He’s, uh, that’s right. I—you know what? I didn’t recognize him! And I should have. Because I love those movies. Alright. Okay. But that’s besides the point. I can’t feel too bad about it because they’ve got their money. They are—they’ve killed a bunch of people. But Voltan’s son Drogo, his blood is up. He’s like, “I wanna go on more raids! I wanna go leave—I should be doing stuff instead of just hanging out in this tent with you, my dad, Voltan, and this nun you’re keeping in a cage in the corner of your tent. Very strange. It’s like it’s like a big dog carrier cage.” Uh, and Voltan threatens him—and I can’t remember exactly why he threatened him. He’s just irritated? That his son was just talking back to him? felicia I don’t know. I just was—I was distracted ‘cause it looked like Anthropologie. He really decorated the interior of that tent with Anthropologie. Even the cage looks like Anthropologie chic.  [Multiple people laugh.]  So I kinda like that scene. elliott Very flowy. A lot of flowy kind of like… felicia A lot of bold patterns! Yeah. elliott Yes. Yeah.  [Laughs.]  Uh, he—she—and the nun is like, “You know, I can cure your face!” A this point I was like, oh, his face was the problem? ‘Cause he’s cover—he’s got this helmet that covers most of his face and it—but the first time you see that wizard shooting lasers at him, it’s not really that clear what he’s doing. He’s helping him in some way. But uh, he goes, “It’s impossible! I’ve tried! It can only—I can only have the pain taken away,  [dramatically]  and that only temporarily.” And then Voltan’s son is like, “What?! Hawk stopped all those slavers? Hold on—I’ve got a plan!” Cut to Voltan just getting lasers shot into his face by that wizard’s fingers. Like, it’s—and every time Voltan is like,  [screaming]  “Ahhh!” Like, it clearly hurts him to have the treatment. So. I don’t know! Maybe he shoulda had the nun try it! Uh— stuart I do the same thing every time I go to the gym, y’know?  [Laughs.] elliott Yeah. Uh— felicia Screaming. elliott Just screaming. Uh, Hawk and his dudes plan what they’re gonna do. Uh, they are not going to pay the ransom. That’s for sure. Because they’re like, “If we pay the ransom then Voltan’s just gonna kill the nun anyway. So we might as well just not do it and make Voltan come here.” And the nuns are like, “Can you please save our abbess?”  [Dan laughs.]  “Which I think was the quest? That you were given?”  [Felicia laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : And Hawk is so—  Felicia : And why did you kill all those slavers— felicia —to get all the money when you’re not going to do anything with the money? elliott Yeah. Yeah. And it’s—that’s a very good point. And Hawk at this point, it’s clear that his larger mission is to stop Voltan. He doesn’t really care who he hurts in the process. felicia And the only thing I remember is that every time you go to the inn, it looks like it’s like some kind of open… just trough. Of food. There was like a huge thing of small chicken and celery—  [Elliott laughs.]  —like it doesn’t feel like… y’know… a place of worship? It just feels like… kind of a bad, y’know, restaurant. ‘Cause there’s just tables there the whole time. crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. I don’t know—  Stuart : Yeah. Like a dining hall. elliott I don’t know where the nuns, like, say prayers. Unless it’s during meals. ‘Cause it’s—yeah. It just seems to be a place that nuns serve… crosstalk Elliott [inaudible]  food. Yeah.  Stuart : I mean, if—  Felicia : Serve food. stuart If you were nuns who were trying to keep the place you say prayers—I don’t know—separate from where the murderers are? I would probably just keep them corralled near the food trough? elliott That’s a good point. They’re not gonna ask a lot of questions. Speaking of food, uh, the dwarf tricks the giant with food talk again. Uh, and I can’t remember if this is where he tricks him out of food or he tricks him into not eating his mixed nuts in a bag that he keeps. Maybe that’s later. This is, uh, there’s—this is the running gag throughout is that the—is that our—is that Baldin is constantly tricking Gort out of his food. The bad guys, they finally attack the convent. Drogo goes to get the ransom and he steals it. The good guys end up killing most of the bad guys, but the nuns are real unhappy. They’re like, “That was not helpful. Why are you doing this?” Uh. She is not happy with what’s going on. Drogo goes back to Voltan and dies in Voltan’s arms. And Voltan is so sad that he orders his henchmen to fight him so that the can kill them as kind of, like, a sacrifice to Drogo’s honor? It’s very strange. crosstalk Elliott : And his henchmen are looking at him—  Felicia : Doesn’t make any sense. elliott [Through laughter]  And his henchmen are looking at each other like, “Is this… was this part of the job when I started? Hold on a second.”  [Laughs.]  Like, “Do we have to do this?” stuart Toxic masculinity, guys! That’s—it’s insidious. felicia It really is. elliott Well, nobody stopped Voltan when they could. When he first started his behavior. And now he thinks he can get away with anything. Y’know. And it’s just not fair. And he talks later about how like, “No women would be with me!” And it’s like, dude—  [Stuart laughs.]  —maybe that’s your fault. Maybe that’s not on anyone but you. felicia Maybe it’s not your weird pussy eye. Okay?  [Multiple people laugh.]  It’s your behavior. elliott Like, it’s the Middle Ages. Have you seen the other people in this movie? It is not a fleet of dreamboats. I think you could—if you had—worked on your personality, I think you could’ve made it work with somebody. Uh, Voltan goes—he rides up to the convent and announces to the nuns, “I’ll be back tomorrow. And when I come back tomorrow with my men, you better give me Hawk and the gold or else.” Which begs the question—why didn’t he just do it then? Why did he give them a day to like plan? And why did he show up by himself? Maybe he was just—he just wasn’t thinking rationally. He’s just so sad that his son got killed. Uh, the heroes decide theyr’e gonna go on the offensive. Somewhat. Because, uh, the witch—Patricia Quinn—she sends them—she teleports them to Voltan’s like henchmen camp and they just—with magic smoke to cloud them  [inaudible] crosstalk Elliott : —and they just slaughter people!  Felicia : Slaughter. Slaughter! elliott It’s—and this is when you get the most repeating crossbow bolt moments— crosstalk Elliott : —and the most repeating Crow arrow-bolt moments.  Felicia : It’s amazing. elliott Where they’re literally just showing you the same shot cut together real fast. Both crossbows and Crow with his bow and arrow. And it’s amazing. Yeah. It’s great. felicia But it’s—there’s so much smoke and the only thing you could see is the end of Hawk’s sword, which makes him the best target to kill.  [Dan laughs.]  ‘Cause you could see that glowing green sword. But then… it’s okay, because the two guys who have the arrows and the crossbows will just mow down everybody anyways. So who cares. elliott And they never need to load either of these. Like, you never see Crow cocking an arrow. Or knocking back an arrow. crosstalk Dan : Cocking an—  Stuart : He’s so fast! He’s so fast!  Felicia : No.  Elliott : And you never see—and you never see— elliott —the other guy cocking his crossbow! It’s just unlimited shots. It’s amazing. stuart Uh-huh. It’s like, uh, like the—what is it? The Roach? The Punisher Roach in the  Cerebus  comics?  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.]  He’s got, like, twin… twin crossbow bolt guns? elliott I did not get that far into  Cerebus , I have to admit. crosstalk Stuart : Oh, okay. Well, I don’t think it’s—  Elliott : So I’m gonna take your word for it. stuart —now is the time to pick it up.  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.] elliott No, no, I think—I mean, I’ve been hearing so many great things about it!  [Dan laughs.]  Uh— dan You can stop after—what is it? “High Society”? “Church of State”? Whatever one’s later.  [Laughs.] stuart Mmmm. elliott Uh, so there’s—that mist—they go, “Oh, the smoke is clearing! We’ve gotta leave!” But it’s like, “You guys are doing great. Like, you’re destroying everybody. I don’t—why don’t you just finish the job now? You’re at Voltan’s camp. I don’t—anyway.” crosstalk Elliott : ‘Cause the movie  [inaudible] Stuart : They’re like, “No. We gotta go—\" stuart “—we gotta go back and save our game.”  [Laughs.] [Elliott laughs.] elliott Uh, Hawk and company, they go back to, uh, the convent to look for—yeah? stuart Maybe they burn through all their, like, single-use abilities for the day? crosstalk Stuart : And they need to recharge ‘em.  Felicia : Yeah. They’re like, “We need to redo our spells.” stuart [Through laughter]  Yep. dan You’re saying they’re taking a short rest. Is that what the— stuart Oh, look at Dan! Look at this guy! crosstalk Dan : I—you forced me! You forced me, Stuart!  [Laughs.] Stuart : Look at Dungeon Master over here!  [Laughs.] [Elliott laughs.] elliott And here’s where—like, this movie—I’ll just—before we finish the film. Like, it does feel to me like you made a  Dungeons & Dragons  movie. In so many ways. There’s so much traveling? There’s so much, like, assembling and people figure out what their abilities are? There’s a lot of, like, yeah. Resting. Like, attacking and then being, like, “Well, uh… the rules say we gotta stop now. So let’s go.” dan I mean, this is totally a filmed LARP.  [Through laughter]  This is the—100%. felicia Mm-hm. dan For better and worse. elliott Now how would—tell me why for better and tell me why for worse. But say it like the comic strip  For Better or Worse [Multiple people laugh.] dan [Through laughter]  Umm… felicia Oh, god. dan Something about Barkley?  [Elliott laughs.]  Is he a dog? Like— elliott Uh, probably, with a name like Barkley! Unless it’s Charles Barkley. felicia Ohh! dan Or am I think about the dog from  Sesame Street ? Or were they both Barkley? Anyway. crosstalk Dan : Have I distracted you enough?  Felicia : They might both be Barkley. elliott Uh, yeah, possibly! I still want an answer but I guess I don’t need it any more. Uh, but you’re right! I hadn’t even thought about that. It is, like, it is a LARP movie. Uh, the—what was the—why am I forgetting it? The name of that documentary about the LARPing group? Like, Darkon or something like that. It’s like you’re watching their game. Anyway. Uh, the nun—who does not approve of Hawk and his fellows refusing to free the abbess and instead just murdering people left and right—she goes to Voltan and helps him get the drop on Hawk. Uh-oh! Voltan sneaks in with all his men. Well, first she poisons the giant and everyone else that they—with a sleeping draught. felicia Go sleepy! elliott They all go real sleepy and when they woke up—when they wake up, not woke up. I mean, woke up ‘cause it is in the past tense and it happened already. But let’s say “wake up.” Uh, Voltan’s got his sword at their necks. And they got the drop on ‘em. And Voltan—I think then kills that nun? Or does he just punch her? felicia Yeah. He kills her. crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. He just stabs her?  Felicia : No, he kills her, I think.  Stuart : He kills her later, I think. Right? felicia No, I thought he killed her right in front of there! Like, “You won’t be able to see it!” And then she—he, like, kills her and the—everyone’s like, “Nuh-oh you didn’t!”  [Multiple people laugh.]  Even his henchmen are like, “Whoa! Over the line, boss!” stuart Yeah. They’re like, “Before when you challenged our friends for a fight  [through laughter]  to the death—”  [Elliott laughs.]  “—we thought you were a little weird.” elliott But it’s—there’s a couple nuns who look alike and so I thought he killed her and then later on another nun showed up and I was like, “Wait, but is that the same? I don’t know.” But uh—the—but I think he does. The… he goes—then he, uh—Voltan taunts them for a while. And then the dwarf taunts him back. And he stabs the dwarf. Who’s tied up! Even the nun wasn’t tied up. She could’ve conceivably batted the knife out of his hands. Uh, and Voltan’s like, “Ugh! This has made me so mad! I need some more magic face treatment!” Goes to get some lasers in the face. Uh… and the witch uses her magic— felicia This is my favorite movie—favorite thing in the movie. There’s three or four favorite things in the movie?  [Multiple people laugh.]  The hula hoops; the fish eating. But when the witch goes into the convent and attacks a guy with silly string—  [Multiple people laugh.] crosstalk Elliott : Yeah!  Stuart : Mm-hm. felicia And he is incapacitated and wrapped up with silly string—like, literal silly string—I think I’ve laughed harder than any comedy I’ve ever watched.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott She holds up her staff and just shoots silly string out of it and it’s another one of those moments when you’re like, now is when you’re doing that? Like—  [Dan laughs.]  Like, why not— crosstalk Stuart : Yeah. She like sticks the little—  Elliott : —ten minutes ago? stuart She sticks her little wand—which kinda looks like a little blowgun—through a crack in the door. And the guard, like—there’s a couple shots of the guy like eyeballing it and being like, “The fuck?” And like, approaching it slowly? And you’re like—  [Elliott laughs.]  “Dude. I know what’s gonna happen.” But I didn’t know! It was so much crazier!  [Elliott laughs.] dan Yeah. It is a lot of silly string. It’s not the regular amount. felicia No, no! It’s like—like—literally a cocoon of silly string. dan Yeah.  [Laughs.]  It would incapacitate me, this silly string. Is what I’m saying.  [Laughs.] stuart Oh wow! Wow. Yeah. And you’re the hardiest of all of us when it comes to silly string resistance! felicia Yeah. You really have the best saving throw on that one. elliott Now, Dan, what’s interesting is that in this scenario, you are projecting yourself as one of Voltan’s guards. Uh… which—  [Multiple people laugh.] crosstalk Elliott : It’s interesting that you see yourself in that position! Whereas I would be more like—  Dan : I don’t think I was—  [Laughs.]  I don’t think I was— elliott —one of Hawk’s men. Who are not great, but, y’know. dan —identifying myself so much as just expressing that, y’know, like, this—this guard. Who probably got fired for all this. Uh, y’know. elliott Oh, he’s dead, Dan. He’s dead.  [Stuart laughs.] dan [Through laughter]  What?! elliott He got fired from life. dan What?! felicia He dead. elliott He’s dead. He was suffocated by that silly string. stuart Yeah. dan [Through laughter]  I gotta text some people!  [Multiple people laugh.] stuart Oh, wow! elliott ‘Cause when I was watching it, I was like— crosstalk Stuart : Feels performative.  Elliott : Yeah. I’d— stuart You didn’t even know him that well!  [Elliott laughs.] elliott I was—  [Laughs.]  When I was watching that scene, I was like, “Yeah, I’d be the kind of witch that shoots silly string out of a staff. At people.”  [Multiple people laugh.]  I think that’s what I’d do. And I’d have neon hula hoops. Uh, the—uh, the dwarf Baldin unfortunately dies. Even her magic is not enough to save him. But he—as he says—he dies the way he wished: surrounded by his friends. stuart Awwww. elliott And they make a little grave for him. A little grave, ‘cause he’s short! Uh… the witch then—it’s another moment where she’s, like, “Okay. I’m gonna help you. I’m going to—” something about “I’m gonna blind them with a hail of magic” or something like that. “Of lightning.” But what actually comes out is kind of a whirlpool of fake snow and glowing bouncy balls?  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : That are just bursting through the door of the convent at the bad guys.  Felicia : It’s amazing. She’s the best thing in the movie. Yeah. It’s incredible.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott I mean, and she is like—I’m a big fan of her performance in this? Like, she has just the right amount of like mysteriousness? felicia She’s the only one. She’s the only one that has any dignity whatsoever in the movie. elliott She has the best shots. There’ll be scenes where like she’s in the extreme foreground in profile and she’s talking to people who are in the background facing the camera? It’s very Ingmar Bergman-y? Uh… it’s almost like she was like, “You’re gonna have to do better when I’m onscreen. Like, c’mon.” Uh, the bad guys are all blinded, I guess, by this hail of what you could buy—I mean, now I’m realizing a lot of her magic is just stuff you could buy in the gift shop of like a science center. Or like— felicia Or a Spencer’s. elliott Yeah. Or Spencer’s. Yeah. It’s just, like, glowing balls. Glowing hula hoops. Silly string. stuart Well, Elliott, to the uninitiated, that sort of thing might seem like magic.  [Multiple people laugh.] dan Okay. Thank you, Arthur C. Clarke.  [Laughs.] [Stuart laughs.] elliott You’re paraphrasing Arthur C. Clarke’s famous dictum that to a lower civilization, novelty gifts would appear to be magic.  [Multiple people laugh.]  She’s just throwing, like, uh, like aprons with naked ladies painting on them at them.  [Multiple people laugh.]  And so—  [Laughs.]  Trying to think what other stuff you could buy at Spencer’s Gifts.  [Laughs.] stuart Tricking people into thinking that a, uh, that cart actually has a pair of testicles hanging behind it.  [Multiple people laugh. Dan sighs.] elliott So, uh, she—they’re all fighting. Uh, Voltan, uh, takes the giant and the—and the nuns, of which there are now three. I guess that’s all there ever were. Uh, prisoner.  [Stuart laughs.]  And is like, “Hawk, give yourself up or I’ll kill them!” And he’s got some elaborate trap. And Hawk is like, “Okay, that’s all I’m gonna do.” He goes, “Put your sword down! Now take off your vestments!” I don’t know why he has to remove his vestments, but he does. And he’s like, “Uh, well, if you’d like to pray, now is the time before I kill you.” And he kneels down and he holds that cross pendant that Eliane gave him when she was—when she—on their wedding day. And what is revealed inside of it? felicia A little tiny dagger!  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Yup! It’s like a little switchblade cross. Which begs the question—why did his fiancée have that? Uh—  [Multiple people laugh.] stuart Just for cocaine. elliott Oh.  [Laughs.]  Just for cutting up lines? Uh… now he—now this is where I have to admit I was doing the dishes and I took my eye away. So how did he use that dagger cross to—to save the day? felicia He threw it, right? And then he got his sword. Then he pulled the sword across the room and he’s like, “You have the power of the mind!” And then… I wasn’t paying attention at this point. I just— stuart I think he threw it and it cut the bonds on Gort the giant who started bashing dudes. Then he called— crosstalk Stuart : —uh, he called the mind sword.  Felicia : Then he called the sword. felicia And then it’s like, “You have the power of the mind!” And Voltan was, “That’s mine!” And then they start doing something and then blah, blah, blah. elliott It’s amazing at that moment is when Voltan realizes that—that Hawk has the mindstone sword. Which he’s been using all movie! felicia He’s been—and he hasn’t— [inaudible]  back! Like, why is this a revelation! Also, you—he left it in the first scene! He’s—it was right there! elliott Yeah. He could’ve taken it. It’s also—you would have to assume it’s part of the legend of Hawk. At one point, someone’s like, “Huh. Word will get around that someone is looking for Hawk,” when they tell Ranulf that so that—and it’s like, whoa! If that kind of word travels then you’d think the fact the guy has a glowing sword has the end of it would also get around, but I guess not. It’s kind of like the old  Teen Wolf  problem of how did these other high schools—how have they not heard ahead of time that this one high school has a werewolf on its team? ‘Cause you’d think that kind of thing would travel! You’d think at least the coaches would tell each other—watch out for this team! It’s got a werewolf on it! stuart Yeah. You would think some desperate coach would show up to a game with a pistol with a silver bullet in it.  [Dan laughs.] elliott Yeah. Or perhaps those teams just have—all sign NDAs. Before the game.  [Multiple people laugh.]  And they’re like, “Why do we have to sign this?” “Don’t worry about it.” And afterwards they’re like, “Oh, we wish we could tell people that we lost to a werewolf.”  [Dan laughs.]  “Oop! Can’t! Can’t break the NDA! You don’t want the werewolf to sue you!”  [Stuart laughs.] dan I like Stuart’s version, though. Where the—  [through laughter]  this coach shoots Michael J. Fox and then everyone’s horrified. And he’s like, “What?! He was a werewolf! Did you not see it? We were all here!”  [Felicia laughs.] stuart Yeah. Like a real strung-up basketball coach like Ben Affleck in that new movie. dan Yeah. elliott And he’s like, “And I also have some things to say about how you’re putting on a high school play where the Confederates are the heroes? ‘Cause that’s a larger issue, too.” Boy, oh, boy.  Teen Wolf . You’ve got a lot of explaining to do. Uh, so anyway—there’s a very slow-motion swordfight between Voltan and Hawk. And I couldn’t tell if it looked cooler in slow motion or lamer. ‘Cause it’s one of those things where clearly… you’re not gonna get a fast-motion swordfight from— crosstalk Elliott : —elderly Jack Palance.  Felicia : Yeah. Lamer. Lamer. elliott It’s lamer that it’s in slow motion?  [Laughs.]  Uh— felicia Very much lamer. elliott Uh, surprise! Hawk wins. Uh, and we see—we finally see Voltan’s horribly scarred face as he dies. Uh… was it—did it live up to the promise, guys?  [Long pause.] felicia It looked like a—somebody—like a butt boil. It was like a butt boil on his eye.  [Dan laughs.]  Kinda like a tomato? Smashed in there? It was pretty gross, but I was just like, “Wow. You got—really need to get that looked at! Like, this—whatever natural, uh, homeopathy you were getting done on this eyeball? Like, you need to really go to the doctor.”  [Stuart laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. You should go to see—  Stuart : Like, I know you like— stuart I know you like your wizard friend.  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.]  You feel bad. But maybe you should go see an actual doctor. elliott Maybe it’s time to stop applying milkwort to it during the full moon. And just, y’know, talk to a dermatologist! But I was like, “Oh, that was it? He could’ve gotten by with that.” Y’know. Again. Middle Ages. You got elves and stuff running around. Uh, but Voltan dies. Finally. He—the world is saved from Voltan. Hawk and his pals leave, but—uh-oh!—that evil wizard god? He floats into the room like an evil Orko and is like, “Hey.” felicia He does look like Orko! He looks exactly like Orko! I was trying to remember the name of it! It literally is Orko! He floats in and then he’s like, sequel time, bitch! elliott Yeah. He’s like, “We have plans for you, dark one! We’re not done with you even though you failed completely at everything we set you up to do.” But yeah. He’s like evil Orko. He even sounds a little bit like Orko, now that I think about it. felicia He does! He does! I was—I totally forgot—thank god you brought that up. ‘Cause I was gonna ask you, like, what was that cartoon character? Thank you. elliott My pleasure. Look. If we could—just to have you on for that moment, I appreciate it. felicia I can sleep now! I can sleep! I didn’t sleep for two days!  [Multiple people laugh.]  I can sleep. elliott And, uh, Hawk—and the giant is like, “Hm, I hear there is some rich barons up in the north who are paying for guardsmen! Perhaps I’ll make a little gold coinage!” And, uh, Hawk finds—they’re riding together—Crow, the elf, has disappeared at this point. Uh, did he go back—I don’t know where he went to. felicia I don’t know! I’m like, where did he go? I love that guy! Pepperoni! Come on!  [Elliott laughs.]  That— elliott I guess he’s gotta—he’s gotta go get himself a new hoodie ‘cause that one is getting a little ripe. Uh—  [Laughs.]  Just wearing it around in the forest for days on end. So Hawk and his giant friend are riding along and they see—who’s this in the forest?—Patricia Quinn. Uh-oh! Some wizards are meeting in the south for bad business. Hawk is like, “Mm! Perhaps you should go to the south instead, Gort the giant?” And the giant’s like, “I guess I won’t be making that money after all. Ha, ha, ha!” And they ride off— felicia “Ha, ha.” elliott —to the sequel which was never made but which I assume would’ve been called:  Hawk: The Surprise Bad Guy . Where it would turn out that like—everyone suddenly realizes, like, “Oh, Hawk is really misusing this mindstone sword by just slaughtering people left and right.” Now, okay. Uh— stuart I think they actually tried to Kickstart, uh, a sequel, like, ten years ago, maybe? For  Hawk the Hunter crosstalk Felicia : Wow.  Dan : Mm.  Elliott : Ohh.  Stuart : Yeah. dan I feel like that seems like a downgrade. Being a Slayer. elliott From Slayer? So what would be an upgrade from Slayer? stuart Mm-hm? dan Uh—uh—well, if we’re following Cube rules, “Hyper-slayer.” stuart Mm-hm.  [Laughs.] elliott Okay. that’s by Cube rules. I mean, uh, I guess—Stuart—in metal terms, what would be one step up from Slayer? Again, Slayer—top tier if you like that kind of sound! It’s not my favorite. stuart Big four. I mean, Metallica’s the next step up from Slayer, arguably. elliott I guess so. I guess that’s true. Uh, where it’s like—it’s slightly more… uh… melodic? And slightly fewer songs about Nazi war criminals? stuart Slightly.  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Um… what would you—but what would you—so, uh, so that’s Dan’s pitch for the sequel is  Hawk the Hyper-Slayer . Do you guys have pitches lined up for the sequel? Uh… I—‘cause— felicia Hawk the Facemasher crosstalk Elliott : That’s pretty good. Yeah.  Stuart : Mm-hm. That’s pretty— stuart —and very specific. crosstalk Felicia : Yep.  Elliott : Yeah.  Dan : Mm-hm. elliott But my real one would be  Hawk the Kindergarten Cop  where the guy’s gotta go undercover as a kid— felicia Gotcha. elliott So here’s the story. Uh, there’s a kindergarten, and guess who’s the principal? Voltan! That’s right—he’s training these kids to be evil wizard sacrifices or something? Looks like someone’s gotta go undercover! Because Hawk can’t just walk in there; Voltan will recognize him! They’re brothers! And so he’s gotta go in as the new teacher—H. Awk. Mr. Harold Awk. Uh, and he—y’know, he’s teaching the kids his own brand of ‘here’s how you use a sword;’ ‘ here’s what a mindstone does.’ One kid talks about how his dad is a real sex machine, just like in the original movie. And…. Then. Uh, I don’t know! What happens at the end of  Kindergarten Cop ? They’ve gotta climb up an electric tower or something like that?  [Laughs.] dan [Sighs.]  I don’t know, Elliott. All I know is— felicia Nope. dan —we talked about getting Felicia out of here early and  [through laughter]  you’ve introduced a whole new bit at the end of this.  [All laugh.] elliott Okay. Let’s just call it  Kindergarten Hawk  and we’ll deal with the details later. So Dan. What do we do after we talk about the summary of the— felicia I’ll read the treatment. elliott [Through laughter]  Okay. crosstalk Felicia : I’ll read the treatment later, okay? I’ll give you notes.  Elliott : Fair. I’ll—I’ll email it to you.  Dan : Okay. elliott If I get notes on that, that’d be great. Uh, can we— felicia Great. Great. elliott And we can attach you as a producer? Possibly star?  [Dan laughs.] felicia Y’know what? Um… I’ll have to—I’ll have to talk to my people. My people will get back to you. elliott That’s fair. felicia Maybe. elliott It would be my three-year-old.  [All laugh.] dan Um, okay. What we do now, this is the final part of the movie portion of this movie podcast. I mean, we talk about movies later. But whatever. You know what I’m talking about. Uh, and that is where—  [Elliott laughs.]  —we make our final judgments about whether this is a good-bad movie—a movie that was funny in its badness; a bad-bad movie—a movie that we just didn’t like; or a movie we kinda liked! And that’s, y’know. Self-explanatory. Uh, I think I’m the dissenting voice so maybe I shouldn’t go first. I don’t know if I should go last, either. crosstalk Felicia : Just go! Go! We already knew you’re gonna—we already know what—  Dan : Okay! I will. Alright! Felicia wants to get out of here! Um—  Elliott : Yeah. Come on, Dan. dan Here’s what I would say. I… this is not a, uh, unique notion to me… uh, I’m sure. Although I came to it on my own so I’m gonna take credit for it. Uh— [sighs.] crosstalk Dan : Like, movies—yeah, gravity.  Elliott : Gravity? Dan, we’ve known about it for hundreds of years!  [Dan laughs.] dan No, I was gonna say, like… movies are obviously about the plot of the movie, but also in a way they are all documentaries in that they are time capsules of when they are made? And uh, bad movies I feel like are often—or low-budget, let’s say, movies. Not bad. Are doubly so because they can’t afford, like… big costume designers or whatnot. Stuff that might, uh, y’know, people are like bringing stuff from home. It feels more of the time. And so on that level, I really enjoyed the movie. And I liked all the silly stuff like the glowing balls. But… on the downside for me, I don’t wanna make it seem like I don’t like fantasy. I feel like I insulted something very dear to, uh, other members of the podcast right now. I—I—I like it a lot, but it is not like the first genre that, uh… appeals to me. So usually I feel like there has to be a thing, specifically, I connect with. Whereas this movie, uh, feels like it was sort of generated by a random fantasy movie generating machine. It feels very basic in the plot. And I don’t wanna be too down on it because I think—although fantasy literature was a thing before this for a while?—uh, this sort of high fantasy?—um… like— elliott I mean, only for centuries. dan Well, I mean like—  [Multiple people laugh.]  But this specific, like, Tolkein-esque, like, thing that then sort of took over a lot of fantasy. Um… like, mostly existed in literature and this was one of the earliest movies, really, of this? So I don’t wanna ding it too much for that, but the story just bored me, guys. I just… couldn’t get into that part of it. But what do you guys say? I—ehh.  [Sighs.]  I don’t know. Marginal good-bad, maybe? But I mostly was bored. elliott Now, Dan, it’s—I mean, you don’t have to—you don’t have to feel bad about not liking it just because I’m gonna say this is a movie I kinda liked. Uh, because it is… but not—it’s not very good. It’s not a good movie. But I think the reasons you didn’t like it are the reasons that I particularly liked it? That, uh, the—it feels like the most basic template fantasy movie I can think of. Like, it really does feel like they’re like, “What do we have in a fantasy movie?” “There’s a bad guy.” “Okay.” “There’s a magic sword.” “Great. Throw it in.” “There’s a witch, maybe.” “Okay. Do it.” “There’s a giant and a dwarf and an elf.” “Yes. Hold on. Throw it in. Yes. Do we have time to add any extra touches?” “Maybe they joke about a chicken at one point.” “Okay. Otherwise?” Like, there’s something so, like, Ur, low-budget fantasy movie about this? That I really enjoyed. And… I think the things that you found boring—which were like the endless scenes of him riding through the forest? I could’ve watched that—  [Dan laughs.]  —for I don’t know how many hours. It was just like, this is so perfectly what it is. And, uh, I was such a fan of the music. Such a fan of the, uh, just the—the hyper-editing of the crossbow bolts?  [Laughs.]  Uh—  [Multiple people laugh.]  Definitely it, uh, it’s—it’s a little bit of a stretch at 94 minutes? Uh, this probably should’ve been, like, a 62-minute movie?  [Dan laughs.]  Uh, but… but I really enjoyed it. I would say good-bad and if it—I’m just listening to the soundtrack, then movie I kinda liked. stuart Yeah. I’m gonna say it’s a movie I kinda liked. Uh, Jack Palance chews all that scenery. Uh… cool haircuts. Uh—  [Elliott laughs.]  Chickens. Magic. Y’know, it’s beyond good and evil and, uh, land of darkness. Etcetera.  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott Uh, and— felicia Uh, I would say that I really enjoyed the movie. In that it is terrible. All these points are valid. There was no plot to be spoken of. The lead character was terrible.  [Elliott laughs.]  But it just had so many choices that were wrong?  [Dan laughs.]  I loved it. Like, every couple minutes I’d be a little bored and then I’d be like, Wow. Who made that decision? Who thought that was a good idea?!” And that’s what I like about bad movies ‘cause I could watch it—I could watch that lizard again?  [Elliott laughs.]  I could watch all the magic again. I could watch that pepperoni elf any time. Every crossbow thing. Like, I genuinely—two days later—wanna watch the movie again. So I would say some of the best of the bad movie. elliott Oh, yeah. This was the first time in a long time that I’ve seen a bad movie and I was like, “I wish we could’ve done this on  Mystery Science Theater felicia For MST3K! I know! I kept doing riffs! I was like, “I should watch it—oh, no.”  [Multiple people laugh.] elliott There were so many moments where I was like, “This is the joke I would’ve done for this part!” felicia This is so perfect! I know! I was just like, “God, this would be so fun to riff. Oh well.” crosstalk Elliott : Yeah. But what are ya gonna do? Maybe someday.  Stuart : So yeah! You’re welcome, guys!  Elliott : Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.  Dan : I mean, I guess…  Felicia : Thank you! elliott Yeah, thank you, Stuart. Uh, and thank you to, uh, our special guest—Felicia Day! felicia Thank you! elliott Thanks so much for— felicia Thanks for having me! elliott Our pleasure. And, uh, y’know. And I—that sounds like it’s an open invitation for us to have you back—  [Dan laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : —whenever we want! So okay, yeah.  Felicia : Yes! As long as you have a bad fantasy movie.  [Stuart laughs.] felicia Especially with silly string. Sign me up. elliott Okay. That’s a very specific genre. But we’ll see what we can do.

[Music ceases.] dan Uh, well? Next on the podcast, uh, well you know what? Before we get into the, uh, Jumbotrons and such, I want to give an update on the—the, uh, thing we did for charity! The livestream for charity. I wanna give a total, uh, amount of the money that was raised. Uh, I don’t have the winners yet. I will have them next time. But right now, thanks to the— elliott Now you’re talking to—you’re talking about our  Howard the Duck  live show, which is still available on the  Flop House  YouTube channel. crosstalk Dan : Yes.  Stuart : Uh-huh. dan Um, and, uh, we encouraged people to give, uh, to charity. Either for hunger relief or to help with racial justice or, y’know. Whatever charity you thought was needed at this difficult time. And  Flop House  listeners, uh, the total in receipts that were gotten—and I wanna also thank Audrey, who—  [Laughs.]  Went through everything manually and totaled this up—um, well I mean, she used a spreadsheet. But. Uh— crosstalk Stuart [Through laughter]  Oh, wow!  Elliott : You mean she didn’t— elliott She didn’t, what, use like, just sticks? crosstalk Elliott : That she was collecting together into bundles?  Dan : Well, I—I—  [Laughs.] dan She had to do a lot of, uh, data entry. Which was wonderful of her. But, um, but yes. The machine did the adding. But uh— elliott She wasn’t just making marks on your wall. dan No. elliott Uh, to count it. stuart Scratching marks into the cell wall of your apartment? dan There are too many marks up there already of like, being like, “Ugh. Miserable days with Dan.” Um—  [Elliott laughs.] elliott So you weren’t kept awake at night by the sound of her abacus beads clicking. As she tallied up the figures.  [Laughs.] dan Yeah. But okay. That’s enough preamble. So raised by  Flop House  listeners, we have: $63,503.38 in total. Plus—on top of that—there’s the $10,000 that the show is donating. Uh, that was— stuart What?! dan —split evenly between food banks and, uh, and bail funds. And so… uh, basically,  Flop House  folks, uh, donated around $73,000. And, uh— stuart That’s crazy. crosstalk Dan : A little—  Elliott : That’s insane! dan That is insane. That— crosstalk Dan : —thank you so much to everyone.  Elliott : And I use “insane”— elliott —not in a derogatory way about anyone’s mental abilities. But that is, like, that’s a huge amount of money! crosstalk Elliott : Did we expect it would be like that?  Dan : That is amazing. dan Uh…  [sighs.]  I thought we could, uh, y’know. I thought there might be a good total, but, uh, this—yeah. You—everyone out there exceeded my expectations and I’m so, like, proud of everybody. Uh, a little data: the average donation was around $55, although some donated, y’know, up to like $1000. There were some donations in that range. Uh, from all over Canada, the UK, Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia—these are some of the places people donated from. And so thank you so much to everybody. Um— elliott Thank you! dan Yeah. And we will have the winners, uh, very soon. This—the totals came in literally, like, five minutes before I got on the call with you guys so I haven’t— crosstalk Dan [inaudible]  random.  Elliott : I went—we were watching— elliott —and we saw someone hand Dan a paper tallying it in the moment? dan Yeah. stuart I, uh, I just wanna say that I’m—I don’t know how everyone feels, but, y’know the last couple weeks I’ve felt kinda powerless and trying to find ways that I can help. Uh, and… uh, seeing this kind of outpouring of generosity is, uh, kind of reaffirming. That there’s a lot of good people out there! So thanks! elliott Yeah. I second that, and I second what Dan said, and it’s already been said well. So I don’t need—I don’t feel like I need to say anything extra. Except! Thank you.  [Stuart laughs.] dan Um, yeah! And with that, I think we can, uh, get on to our Jumbotrons. We have no, uh, advertisements this week but we have a few, uh, messages from folks. elliott Uh, so we don’t have, uh, we don’t have any—we don’t have a Squarespace ad where I can do— dan No, you can’t. elliott I can’t do PepperoniElf.com? Alright.  [Multiple people laugh.] dan [Through laughter]  Save it, for, uh—  [Laughs.] crosstalk Stuart : I mean, you still can!  Dan : —a mani—  [Laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : I mean, it’s—we provide only the—  Stuart : I mean, you should. stuart You should save it. elliott Only the finest elf-cured pepperoni. But, uh, so I have a Jumbotron. I’d like to—I’ll do one, if that sounds good to you guys. dan Sounds great! crosstalk Stuart : Yeah. I’m okay with it.  Elliott : Okay. This message— elliott Okay. Great. This message is: “Congratulations, Windsor, on your graduation from film school!” And the further message is: “Congratulations, Windsor, on your graduation from film school! We are so proud of your accomplishment, even though the entire industry is shut down. We are sure you will find your dream job soon—by “we” of course, I’m referring to me (your mom) and my best friend, Judd Apatow. Floppers? Please offer a hopeful word since his commencement was cancelled.” I’m so sorry to hear that! But congratulations. That’s great news. And the industry is in a short-term shutdown at the moment but it will come back. People need entertainment. People need storytelling. And something that I keep, uh… saying in conversation with a friend of mine, who is a theater director, uh, or rather what I keep thinking of that she said—she said, “I have to remember—theater companies may be in trouble, but theater will always continue. That theater is not in trouble.” And I feel like film is similar. Uh, film companies come and go. Films come and go. But the need for film will always be there. So don’t worry! You will get your shot. So congratulations! That’s fantastic! stuart Yay! And, uh, I have a Jumbotron to read as well and I believe this one, uh, is going to make me stretch my acting chops a little bit and do a voice. So let me get this right. crosstalk Stuart : Okay  [inaudible muttering] Elliott : But you normally— elliott You normally do a voice, right? Like, your—you are speaking with a voice. stuart Yeah. I do. Actually, you’re right, Elliott. Thanks for correcting me.  [Multiple people laugh.] dan You know what? I’m just gonna do that whenever Elliott does—like, that’ll be the standard now. That’s, uh—  [Multiple people laugh.]  That’s great. stuart Okay, okay, okay. I think I’m ready, guys. “ Garden Plots with Skeletor  is a podcast about gardening, hosted by me—Skeletor! Yes. I’m taking time between my attacks on He-Man to help you botanically-benighted—”  [Dan laughs.]  “—boobs know what it takes to keep a pothos—pothos?—alive!

Do you want to be there to witness the crushing defeat of He-Man once and for all? Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts, and become a master of the universe! And your garden. So subscribe to the podcast— Garden Plots with Skeletor dan Uh… do you—I— stuart I had a couple of mess-ups. Is that okay? Is that okay? crosstalk Dan : I mean, I don’t wanna—I don’t wanna note—note you to death?  Elliott : No. I mean—I—no— dan But it sounded a little like your normal voice. crosstalk Dan : I—I will say.  Stuart : Ah. Interesting. Interesting. Uh, thanks— elliott I’m saying—I—actually—and this is a compliment—uh, now I’m gonna pronounce it “He Man”  [enunciating each equally, as Stuart did, rather than emphasizing the “He-Man” as it is normally pronounced]  from now on. I was saying “He-Man,” but I prefer “He-Man.” stuart Yeah. dan I will say—I mean, maybe you’re going in a different direction with your conception of Skeletor. Like, a more realistic, sort of less… elliott Well he didn’t sound like—he didn’t sound like Frank Langella, is what you’re saying. dan Yeah. stuart Yeah. I was trying to really diverge from Frank Langella’s performance. dan Okay. Yeah. You gotta make it your own. Uh— stuart Yeah. You know. dan Okay. Well what we do now is we have letters from listeners. Listeners… like you? Maybe, if you send in a letter! I can’t guarantee it. Y’know? crosstalk Elliott : Y’know, Dan—  Dan : It’s not—  Stuart : We know. elliott It seems to me—okay, Stuart. Cue the—the fife music.  [Stuart imitates high-pitched woodwind instrument.] [Singing]  There is a legend from long ago; a legend of the letterrrrrs! Words on parchment sent along on raven claw or the winds of the Wessssst! These letters reached the eyes and ears of Floppers there and Floppers here! These letters carry the magic of communication all across the laaaaaand! When the shadows hang along the mountains and Gargerol the Conquerer sweeps in with his mighty hordes to burn your village and kill your children—well? There’s a letter you can write to the  Flop House ! Tell us about what happened and though we can’t stop the bad guy we can tell you—hey, that stinks! So send us a letter. A missive or perhaps—just throw some words into the scrying pool—”  [Dan laughs.]  “—at the edge of the haunted glennnn! Perhaps we’ll hear it thennnn! Letters—oh, I forgot. You are a villager in the Middle Ages.”  [Dan laughs.]  “You can’t write and we can’t read.”  [Stuart finishes his fife impression. Dan laughs.] crosstalk Dan : Oh. Oh. Almost as good as—  Elliott : Thank you, Stuart, for the accompaniment. dan [Through laughter]  —the music from  Hawk the Slayer . Oh, beautiful. Um, so this first letter is from Arie, last name withheld. Who writes: “After a year of trying to convince me to check out a podcast—any podcast at all, but yours specifically—I finally caved to my partner’s whims and listened to 2014’s “A Talking Cat!?!” On a road trip to NYC. I cried with laughter and now—much like a baby chick imprinted on my three flop house mamas—I refuse to follow anyone else. Lately I’ve been listening in bed at night, and the best thing’s happened: my anxious fever-dream mind chills out to your apparently soothing AF voices, and I fall into the sweetest dreams. What I’m trying to say is— Flop House , you seem to be a cure for the nightmares I’ve been having the last few years. So thanks for that. Which leads me to—\" elliott You’re very welcome! dan “—what are your favorite dream sequences, or which do you consider best-slash-worst in film? Love ya! Arie.” Um, I—you know what? Uh, springs to mind is, uh, there of course is the dream sequence in  Spellbound , the Hitchcock movies that was, uh, designed by Salvador Dali, which is, uh, lovely. And, uh… very… Dali-esque. And, uh… and, y’know, I love—I love dream sequences that are largely, like—  [Laughs.]  I don’t know. Like, people running around with giant cardboard eyes in the background and stuff like that. Um—  [Multiple people laugh.]  I also remember that, like, people gave  Inception  a lot of shit because they were, like, “Oh, y’know, this is not how dreams work. It’s not that dreamlike. Whatever.” And I’m like—and I thought that was so, uh… alien to my own experience, ‘cause I was like, “No, man… when I dream, like, everything around me is fairly realistic. It’s just that geography doesn’t make sense and time periods merge and like y’know. Like, stuff like that happens. Y’know. Like, plot lines seem to make sense in the moment but not later on when I’m thinking about them.” But it’s not like— elliott Hm. Interesting. Interesting. I have a rebuttal to this in a moment. dan Okay. Go on. I mean, I’m just saying that I don’t like, dream in sort of like a Terry Gilliam-esque sort of, uh, fantastic… universe. Or anything like that. elliott You don’t have an Imaginarium, is what you’re saying. dan [Through laughter]  No. Dr. Parnassus does not show up. elliott Now here’s the—now I—my favorite dream sequence in movies is similar. My favorite is in the original  Manchurian Candidate , when they’re having dreams that have been implanted by the brainwashers—the Commie brainwashers—but their real memories are leaking through. And so they’re remembering being stuck, uh, at a garden convention with a bunch of, uh, ladies talking about flowers that are actually Communist agents talking about assassination. And what I like about that is—like Dan is saying—it is not shot woozy or like gooey. It’s like, it’s very matter of fact. But the things that are happening are… somewhat bizarre. That the imagery is, but it’s shot in a matter-of-fact way. And it’s just a strange situation that feels real. On the other hand, here is my issue with the dreams in  Inception ! ‘Cause that’s what I was gonna say. It’s not the worst dream sequences in movies. Not at all. But that my problem with the dreams in  Inception  are—they are so not personal to Cillian Murphy. ‘Cause we’re supposed to be in his head, right? stuart Yeah. dan Uh, yeah. elliott And it’s like, when I have dreams, the people in it are people I’ve known. The situations are situations I’ve been in. And they—it’s—it’s not like  Willy Wonka  phantasmagorical or anything. But I don’t have a dream where it’s just an action sequence from a James Bond movie on the snowy slopes of the Alps? Or like, a dream sequence where it’s just a nondescript office building or a hotel? Like, my dreams are… places—  [Dan laughs.]  —I’ve been and people I know in new configurations. And like I’ve had so many dreams about working—being at  The Daily Show  and being like, “I don’t work here anymore! Why do I have to write a script now?” Like, then they’re like, “Where’s the script? Rehearsal’s in ten minutes!” Like, I would’ve rather  Inception  had a lot of dreams where he was, like, disappointing his family or like having trouble at work or things like that. Y’know. Dream stuff. But it would still be shot the same way. stuart Yeah. Yeah. elliott What do you think, Stu? stuart So I would say, uh… you guys are both wrong. The, uh—  [Elliott laughs.]  The best dream sequences in film, uh, number one, uh… involves a hamburger getting up off of a grill—  [Elliott laughs.]  —and playing “Everybody Wants Some.” crosstalk Elliott : Now, is that a dream sequence—  Stuart : From  Better Off Dead Dan : I mean, that’s more of a daydream. elliott Yeah. That’s a daydream. stuart Mmm… okay? I didn’t realize that’s how we were splitting hairs. Um—  [Elliott laughs.]  And then, uh, I don’t know. Runner-up is, I guess, the Masquerade Ball in  Labyrinth. elliott Uh, now I was gonna assume that you would pick something from the  Nightmare on Elm Street  series since there’s so many dreams in that. stuart Oh, you would think that, wouldn’t you?  [Laughs.] elliott Now I feel like I’m stereotyping you. I apologize.  [Laughs.] dan I—well, I mean, like, it’s my understanding that he’s not such a  Nightmare  fan. And you know what? I used to be with him. Uh— stuart I’m just not into a bad guy whose arms stretch out that far. It’s too scary.  [Multiple people laugh.] dan That’s the thing! Like, everyone talks about, uh, how scary the first one is? I’m like, “Really? Have you seen those, uh, janky long arms that he has? Uh—\"  [Multiple people laugh.]  But I do—  [Laughs.] crosstalk Dan : I do like the way—  Elliott : I mean, the fact that he is a— elliott The fact that he is a villain who wears a sweater and a hat is—right off the bat—takes the scariness down a little bit for me. dan I do like the weirdness, though, of the later, uh… uh…  Nightmare  movies where it’s really, like, fantasy-horror weirdness. And, y’know, people are turning into, uh—  [Laughs.]  Um, exercising cockroaches that get trapped in a roach motel. Like, that’s pretty great.  [Long pause.]  Um— stuart Yeah. It’s a good series of movies.  [Elliott laughs.] dan Uh, okay! So moving on to the next letter. Uh, this is from Seth, last name withheld. Who writes: “I was pleased to hear that Elliott’s kid has been watching-slash-listening to  Newsies . I credit the original Disney motion picture with radicalizing me as a child. It taught me that even the seemingly powerless could prevail over injustice if they stood united. And also that Santa Fe was allegedly dope. That healthy base of  Newsies  mixed with the punk music of my teenaged years turned me into the godless anarchist I remain to this day. So my question for all of you is as follows: are there any movies that you watched as a child that—looking back—you believe shaped your moral compass? Or kid-friendly movies that have come out since your childhood which the parents among us could use to prime the next generation of Floppers to be respectable young radicals? No gods, no masters! Seth, last name withheld.” elliott Uh, I was thinking about this and it was hard for me to think of specific movies that shaped my morality, ‘cause I feel like my morality was so shaped by Marvel comic books? And the tenets that Spider-Man, particularly, espoused? Uh, and to a lesser extent Captain America? But uh… I would say, uh, I—a movie I was gonna mention, uh, when I just knew the question but didn’t know the whole context was  Newsies . Because ironically, I think  Newsies —not ironically. Uh, strangely,  Newsies  has been really helpful in explaining to Sammy kind of what’s going on with the Black Lives Matter movement and those protests? Uh, to kind of help him understand why a protest happens and what mass action looks like and kind of who does it. And  Newsies  is a good primer on that. Which is ironic, because Disney is such a notoriously—and traditionally—anti-union company? Like, literally—the crisis moment when Walt Disney was there was when the animators tried to unionize and he had a—had a—basically, like, a panic breakdown? And it was never quite the same there ever since? But, uh… I would say that a movie that came out that I am looking forward to re-showing my son—because he was a little too young when I showed it to him the first time—is  The Iron Giant ? Which is—I’ve always found really beautiful because—partly because it’s—really spreads a healthy disrespect for national intelligence and military… leadership. And the idea of… uh… military strength as the go-to for how you should interact with the world? But that the, uh, the whole message of the giant being, basically, a living weapon who chooses to turn off that programming and sacrifice himself? And at the end, when—when he’s remembering Hogarth saying, “You are who you choose to be,” and he sacrifices himself to save the town. Like, I cry every single time. And I just think it’s a beautiful movie about… uh… a character who—when he resorts to violence he knows he’s making a mistake. And he needs to not do that. And that the way he can best help people is by… uh… not being a killing machine? But instead being a—like, a real hero. So I really like that movie a lot! Again, it’s a little too violent—I showed it to him when he was younger, and it was a little—it is a little too violent for young-young kids ‘cause there’s a ton of explosions and stuff. Especially at the end. But. Anyway. That’s the movie I would say. dan Uh—  [sighs.]  I—y’know, I’m having a hard time with this one, too, because—I mean, partly because I have a hard time remembering what my favorite movies were when I was genuinely young. Like… I remember that once I was sort of in my teens, the movies I watched over and over again were  Heathers Aliens , and, uh… uh… shoot.  Army of Darkness . Which I don’t think  [through laughter]  any of those are necessarily, uh, what you should turn to for moral guidance, per se. I don’t think they’re  [through laughter]  amoral movies. Uh… well, in some ways. But uh— elliott I mean, somewhat.  [Laughs.] dan Yeah. But um— elliott I mean,  Army of Darkness  is—if you were like, “What’s the message of that movie?” You’d be like, “I’m not sure.”  [All laugh.] dan It’s true. Um… and the thing is, like, stuff I really dug as a kid, y’know, like…  Sherlock Holmes  and Uncle Scrooge kinda gave me a lot of the wrong lessons about overvaluing, um, intelligence and money. So—  [Laughs.]  I’ll just, uh, I’ll just pivot and use this as a, um… way to, uh, compliment my family, y’know, my—my, uh, father and mother who, like, um… were religious but not in any sort of exclusionary way in sort of, like, I feel like… the purest, uh… vision of the best parts of Christianity. Where, uh, all are deserving of love and care and… uh… not to be discriminated against. And, uh, my brothers showing me that sort of love. And I remember my brother John, um, saying, y’know, like, “You’re gonna grow up; you’re gonna fall in love with people. Maybe you’ll fall in love with a man! Maybe you’re—which means that you’re gay. But it doesn’t matter, y’know. I will love you no matter what. That is fine.” And, uh, to have that message given to me, um… when I grew up in the middle of the country, let’s say? Where such things were not, uh… uh… a message given out? As much as it should’ve been? Um… particularly when I grew up? Uh, was a wonderful gift and so maybe… we shouldn’t—  [through laughter]  look to Hollywood movies for our moral lessons because often they have really weird, hidden ones that aren’t so good. stuart Now—technically, Dan, I think you should—if you’re gonna be giving your family a shoutout, that’s a Jumbotron. crosstalk Stuart : But I guess Elliott and I—  [Laughs.] Dan [Through laughter]  Oh yeah! We all did it!  [Elliott laughs.] dan We all did it! elliott The hat trick! stuart Uh, no. And I’m—that actually, like, leads, uh to what I was gonna say. I feel like… so much of, uh, so much of the movies I watched growing up I’ve had to, like, de-program myself from. Uh, y’know, growing up in a, y’know, a house with, uh… y’know, just my younger brother, I feel like there—I didn’t have a lot of, uh, feminine influences in my life? And I had, uh, I’ve had to learn—unlearn a lot of, um, dumb bullshit in my head. Over the years.  [Laughs.] elliott Well I think what—what you’re saying and what Dan’s saying are both of a piece in that, like, you can’t use—I don’t think that the question writer is saying they’re gonna do this? But you can’t outsource teaching morality to your children to… entertainment or any kind of culture? Like, that’s the responsibility of a parent, to lead them through it and also to be there so that when they’re watching things you can parse it with them and say, like, this part— stuart Interpret it. elliott Yeah. This part? You have to understand this way. This part, you have to understand this way. And like… to, uh, to be ready to… disavow things that you might love that are not—that don’t have that proper message. I mean, like, there are certain things that I’m really looking forward to show my kids but they have to be old enough that I can talk to them and say—okay. This is why this is not how you interact with the world. Like, this is—this is not something to—to draw lessons from. stuart That’s why these nerds should not be getting revenge.  [Dan laughs.] elliott Well, we are not watching those movies for a variety of reasons.  [Stuart laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : I mean, they’re not good, but.  [Laughs.] Dan : Well—  [Laughs.]  Certainly not in the manner in which they— dan [Through laughter]  —go about it. Um… whoo! Uh…  [Laughs.]  Whoo! elliott Yeah. Ooh boy. Ah. But even, like, there’s stuff like, uh, even movies like  RoboCop , which ostensibly have like an anti-corporate and anti-, um… anti-police message to a certain extent. They’re still—underneath it—they’re still that subtext that violence is the solution to… problems. And like, that’s not—the subtext to so many movies is… look. At a certain point you have to shoot somebody or punch them. And it’s something that—I’ve mentioned  Spider-Man  comics before. Like, the principles that Peter Parker espouses are so important to me? But I started reading  Spider-Man  comics to my kids and I’m like, “Oof. A lot of this is just him punching or kicking people in the face.”  [Laughs.]  I think we’re gonna take a break from these for a long time.  [Pause.]  So instead we’re mostly reading, uh, old  Fantastic Four  comics in which there’s not that much hitting and there’s a surprising amount of just meeting people from other—meeting new types of people and liking them! stuart Yeah. You’re not just reading  Bone  over and over or something?  [Dan laughs.] elliott We have—we actually—we haven’t started reading  Bone . I do want to read that to them. dan Um, okay, guys! Well— elliott Unless that one’s not okay anymore. Is there new stuff about  Bone  that I should know? stuart No, it’s okay. elliott Okay. dan Let’s move on to the final segment. Where we— elliott Okay. Oh, to be honest, I should say—people might find this interesting that, uh, the one comic book thing that my kids want me to read to them over and over again is—there’s an issue of  Silver Surfer  that I have in a trade paperback that Jim Starlin wrote and Ron Lim drew. Where the Impossible Man sings his parody version of “Make ‘em Laugh” from  Singing in the Rain ? And every single morning—it’ll be, like, six in the morning—Gabriel will wake up. He’s, like, almost one-and-a-half now. No, he’s almost two now! He’s older than that. He’s almost two now. And he’ll be, like, “Look—Silver Surfer “Make ‘em Laugh!” Sing it!”  [Stuart laughs.]  And I’ll start singing and he’s like, “No. In the book!” And so I have to go get the book and, like, open it up so he can look at it. And… so that’s—that’s—so if you’re looking at the, uh, Venn diagram of culture that is interesting to my almost-two-year-old right now, it is, uh,  Singing in the Rain  and the Impossible Man. stuart Yeah. elliott And where that overlaps is what he’s really into. dan Uhhhh… now we talk about movies that we would like to recommend that—let’s say you could watch in addition to  Hawk the Slayer . If you have— elliott Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! dan Let’s pretend we all have infinite time and we can watch whatever. Uh, what else? elliott And  Infinite Jest dan Yeah. And  Infinite Jest . Sitting on our, uh, bookshelf. Maybe we got 90 pages into it, and, uh, thought, mm, this isn’t going enough of anywhere that I care about. I’ll just go back and read some of the essays instead! Uh— elliott I mean, I’ll admit I have never—never even cracked open the book. I’ll—it’s one I never made it past looking at it at the book—on the bookshelf and being like, hm. That seems like a lot of book.  [Dan laughs.] dan Mm-hm. Uh, to what end— stuart I’m like, who’s the… I’m like… who’s the bad guy? Is it—  [Dan laughs.]  —zombies?  [Elliott laughs.]  Is it a wizard?  [Multiple people laugh.]  Can’t tell from the jacket so I’ll just put it back on the shelf!  [Multiple people laugh.] dan Is it a guy named “Jest” who lives infinitely? crosstalk Elliott : Mmm, I’m not get—  Stuart : Could be! elliott I’m not getting a _Poison Flower d uel vibe—  [Dan laughs.]_ —from this book. stuart Mm-hm! Exactly! dan Uh, okay. I—I… don’t have a, uh, full-throated recommendation this week? But I could not sleep— elliott Just half-throat it! Half-throat it, Dan. dan I’ll half-throat it.  [In hoarse, whispery, strained voice]  So, uh, this week I— [regular voice]  No. I don’t like that either.  [Elliott laughs.]  Um—this, uh, last night I could not sleep as I imagine, uh, many of us have gone through from time to time during this extremely stressful part in, uh… our nation and the world’s history? Um… and so I  [through laughter]  watched, uh,  Knock Off , the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, um… uh, with Rob Schneider as well? Uh, how do you pronounce the director’s name? crosstalk Dan : I’m not really—that’s—  Elliott : Oh, no. It’s— elliott It’s pronounced “Rob Schneider.” dan [Through laughter]  No. It’s, uh, Tsui Hark? “Swee” Hark? I don’t— stuart Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah. crosstalk Stuart : “Sue Hark,” I think.  Dan : Like, a well-known— dan Well-known, uh, uh… martial arts, uh, mostly director. Um, he did  Once Upon a Time in China ; he did  Iron Monkey ; he did a bunch of stuff. Uh, and he also  [through laughter]  made a couple movies with Van Damme! Uh, this one and  Double Team . And, um… look. I’m not gonna make a lot of, uh… uh… claims for this movie? At a certain point— crosstalk Elliott : Oh, you’re not?  [Laughs.] Dan : —I just lost— dan No, at a certain point I completely lost track of what was supposedly  [through laughter]  happening? And, uh, there’s a little less crazy action in it than I would like for a movie that has these sporadic, amazing, uh, bursts of crazy action? But it is a movie about, uh, knock-off jeans, uh, that one might wear, uh, that have, uh, nanobot explode-y things in them. Bombs, I guess they’re called. Although, y’know, “explode-y things” is something I’m trying to get to catch on. And, uh— stuart Yeah. I think you could do it. dan And there’s a point at which, um… uh… Rob Schneider whips Van Damme’s butt with an eel! So if, y’know. That’s something you can’t— stuart Sounds great. dan —you can’t buy. You just can’t buy it anymore. crosstalk Elliott : No, you can buy it. You can buy it.  Stuart : Wait, you can’t buy it? elliott You can buy this movie—  [Dan laughs.] dan Oh, right. elliott Yeah. dan [Through laughter]  I thought you meant that I could get like on a Cameo with Van Damme and Rob Schneider and— elliott Possible! I don’t know! dan —and an eel, maybe. crosstalk Stuart : Certainly possible. They’re like, they’re offering—  Dan : Get an—the eel’s probably the cheap thing.  Elliott : It’s just—it’s just—yeah. The eel is— stuart They’re offering Cameo Zoom calls now!  [Multiple people laugh.]  Where you can have a chat with Jeremy Piven for like $15,000 for ten minutes. dan Can I pay to not talk to Jeremy Piven?  [Laughs.] stuart Uh-huh. That’s $20,000, Dan. I’m sorry. dan [Through laughter]  Oh, shit. Well, it’s worth it.  [Laughs.]  Um—  [Stuart laughs.] elliott I just—I like, Dan, that you’re like—this is the movie. You can’t buy that kind of thing.  [Dan laughs.]  Well, then—how—wait? So is it not a movie that exits?  [Stuart laughs.] dan Actually, it is on Amazon Prime.  [Through laughter]  So if you’re paying for Amazon Prime, uh, you can—you can see it right now! Uh, guys, what do you have to recommend? Stuart. I’m gonna point to you. stuart Cool. Uh, I’m gonna recommend a thriller from 1992 called  Deep Cover . That’s right! Uh—  [Elliott laughs.]  —directed by Bill Duke. Uh, who’s a character actor and a director. Uh, you might know him from  Commando . You might know him as Mac From  Predator . Um, and  Deep Cover  is, uh, as you would imagine, it’s about a… uh… it’s a—about a damaged but idealistic police officer who—played by Laurence Fishburne or Larry Fishburne, uh, as the credits call him. And he—uh— elliott That’s how he used to go. That’s what he used to go by. stuart He goes undercover and becomes a drug dealer, uh, working alongside, uh, Jeff Goldblum. And it’s two, uh, two great actors at kind of, like, kind of peak sexiness? Maybe not for Goldblum, y’know. He’s been, y’know. You know,  The Fly  and  Earth Girls Are —y’know. He’s great. Um— elliott So you’re saying his peak sexiness was in  Earth Girls Are Easy  where he was kind of like, uh, covered in blue fur, or  The Fly crosstalk Elliott : —where he’s half fly?  Dan : I mean, that is— dan I mean, those are very short parts of their respective movies.  [Laughs.] crosstalk Elliott : Mmmm, I guess it—  Stuart : Yeah. But that’s—you know, I’m into what I’m into!  Dan : I mean, less of  The Fly , but.  [Elliott laughs.] elliott I mean,  The Fly  is about him turning into a fly. It’s— crosstalk Dan : Yeah. But I mean, he could—he gets shaved pretty early—  Stuart : Yeah. So… dan —in  Earth Girls Are Easy stuart Uh, but  Deep Cover  is like a ‘90s noir. The soundtrack is great. Uh, it’s… uh… shot really well. It’s got so many awesome, like, lurid colors. Uh, it’s just a beautiful-looking movie and it’s edited well and it kinda all fits together with this, like, pulsing, uh, soundtrack. Uh, if—it’s like a little bit grimy and also sexy. It’s great. Check it out. elliott Uh, I’m gonna recommend a movie from 2015. That’s right! 21st century, everybody. stuart Wow! crosstalk Elliott : Yep. I’m gonna recommend the movie—  Stuart : Do I get the—do I get the old movie prize of the episode? elliott I think you do. Yeah. crosstalk Elliott : Strangely enough.  Stuart : 1992! Cool! elliott What’s going on? I’m gonna recommend the movie  Slow West , uh, starring Kodi Smit-McPhee—that’s right! The second Nightcrawler. And Michael Fassbender. That’s right—the guy from  Prometheus . What was the character’s name? crosstalk Stuart : Uh… Michael?  Dan : Uh, Prometheus Jones. elliott Prometheus Jones. Yeah.  [Laughs.]  That’s—and it is a kind of—uh, it’s, uh, written and directed by John Maclean—or McClean, I don’t know exactly how it’s pronounced. But, uh, it’s a sort of, uh… stuart Prometheus Jones sounds like a  2000 AD  comic.  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.] elliott Yeah. It does. It does sound like a  2000 AD  comic. Uh, and he’s like, an amoral, like, what. Interplanetary like gambler and bounty hunter? Something like that? stuart Yep. Yep. dan Nice. elliott And they’re supposed to be funny, but you’re like… is this? Where are the jokes?  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.]  Uh, so it is about a—it’s kind of a picaresque, uh, Western about a, uh, Scotsman. A young man who goes out to the American West to find the woman he loves, who has run off after, uh, a misunderstanding, uh, in their native Scotland. And finds himself so incredibly ill-equipped for existing out on the frontier. And, uh, gets matched up with Michael Fassbender’s character, who is a bounty hunter who—at first—is helping him because he knows—but the Scotsman doesn’t know—that there is a bounty on the woman that he’s looking for. And this guy’s gonna lead him right to it. But they come to, uh, help and appreciate each other eventually. And it feels a little bit like… if the more—if the less goofy moments of, uh,  The Ballad of Buster Scruggs  was a full movie? Then it might be something like this? crosstalk Elliott : It’s called—  Stuart : Yeah, I can see that. elliott It’s called  Slow West  but it’s not actually that—I put off watching it for a while ‘cause I was worried it was gonna be super slow? But it is actually not that slow. It moves at a very easy but nice pace and, uh, there’s some really cool, uh, choreographed, uh… kind of shoot-‘em-up scenes? But there’s also some sweet stuff in it. And some funny stuff in it. And I ended up liking it a lot. stuart And, uh… what’s, uh, what’s that other guy that’s in that movie?  [Laughs.] elliott Uh, I mean, Ben Mendelsohn’s in it. stuart Yeahhh! elliott Yeah. dan Okay. Well— elliott Is that the guy that you referred to? I mean, there’s other guys in it. It’s not just the three guys, but. crosstalk Stuart : Oh, but what if it was a stage play of three guys?  [Laughs.] Dan [Sighs deeply.] elliott Three—yup. Who would think—I mean, that’s—there are lots of stage plays that are just three guys, but. stuart Yeah. dan So guys—uh—oh, god. elliott Like if  Waiting for Godot  had one less guy. crosstalk Stuart : Oh, yeah. That makes sense.  Elliott : It would just be three guys. Yeah. dan Um… well! Unlike, uh, our wonderful guest Felicia Day, I don’t have to, uh, feed a child or attend to my crock-pot, uh, chicken dish. That she mentioned before the show. But it is very hot in this room, so we should sign off soon. But I did want to say another thank-you to everyone who, uh… donated as part of our fundraiser or, y’know, would’ve donated anyway but saw fit to enter our raffle, which is wonderful. Uh, as Elliott put it last time, there are other reasons—better reasons—than to enter a raffle to donate to charity. Um—  [Elliott laughs.]  —and, uh, we did get, um… it was around… 1,100 uh, uh… emails? So we will be doing that, uh, reading of, uh,  The Boy Next Door , which is something that we have to work out amongst ourselves. Uh, I think. elliott It was literally a couple nights ago that I was suddenly—I was—you had told us that the kind of early tally and I was like, “This is great!” And I was bragging to my wife and I was like, “We did a great job!” And oh, no. Now we have to do that  Boy Next Door  thing.  [Laughs.]  Like, it just dawned on me, like, oh, we have to go through with it now.  [Dan laughs.] crosstalk Dan : Yeah. We gotta figure that out.  Stuart : It wasn’t my— stuart It wasn’t my incessant text messages?  [Dan laughs.] elliott I mean—wait. The text messages when you were like, hey!  Boy Next Door ! Hey, boys—next door!  [Dan laughs.]  You were just so excited about it. Let’s get next door with that boy! And I’m like, okay, Stu. Okay. stuart Uh-huh. Like, I don’t know about this emoji combination, but I think he’s trying to say “the boy next door.” elliott He’s like, well he put a boy, a neck, and a door… I assume that the neck is for “next,” but—oh, wait! No. Okay. Now it’s—it’s a boy sign and then an exit sign. And then a nest and then a door. And I guess that the nest probably should’ve been before the exit sign so that I could kinda mush ‘em together. Okay. Well this one right here— stuart I’m really—I’m not good at it.  [Dan sighs.] elliott This one—it’s—it’s a butt and binoculars. dan Oh, god. elliott I guess that’s ‘cause he’s stalking Jennifer Lopez? This is— crosstalk Elliott : His emojis are getting very complicated.  Stuart : I mean, there isn’t technically a butt emoji. Is there, Dan?  [Laughs.] [Dan laughs.] elliott I mean, I guess there’s a peach emoji, probably. Right? dan There’s a peach. Um… uh, for Peaches! The Original Peaches! Anyway. Uh—  [Elliott laughs.]  Also— stuart Wait, are we butts?! crosstalk Dan [Through laughter]  Yeah. We are three butts.  Elliott : No. No. I— dan We are three butts. elliott We are three butts. I mean, we have them. I like, Dan, that you had to make sure that we knew that “Peaches” were the Original Peaches.  [Dan laughs.] dan [Through laughter]  Um—  [Laughs.]  Uh—I mean, we haven’t—I—I just wanted to say, too, like, I think this exceeded beyond our wildest dreams. Uh, we haven’t discussed it; I don’t want to commit us to anything; but I think that if the world continues to be crazy we probably will do another thing at some point along similar lines. So thank you for, uh, making it wonderful. And, um… yeah! Uh… check— elliott I mean, and you don’t have to—if you—if you missed the original contest, you don’t have—doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to donate to charity! Uh, that—I believe—is the list of charities still up on the website, Dan? dan Uh, yes. And if you missed the original broadcast, uh, we should reiterate that it is up on our YouTube page. Which is  YouTube.com/c/TheFlopHousePodcast . But you can also just google it. Um, as with anything these days. Uh… What are you about to say, Elliott? elliott No, I was just gonna say—I was gonna say also, like, just, thank you to everybody and, uh, please keep the generosity going and we probably will do—hopefully the world will fix its problems in the next month or two—  [Dan laughs.]  —and we’ll never have to do that again. But if the world doesn’t fix its problems then I think—yeah. We should try to do something. dan Uh… y’know? Hey! Check out the other great podcasts at  MaximumFun.org . Thank you for, uh, being our network. Thank you for all that you do. Thanks to Jordan Kauwling for, um, the, uh… the work that she does on this show. Uh, producing it. I wanna thank—again—as long as we’re talking about the, um, the live show, I wanna thank—on the show—as well as we did on the live show—uh, Matt Carmin and John Holt for all the tech stuff they did for us and the animations. And, uh, and Tony Ochre for supplying the intro that we always use in our shows. Anyway! Now that that’s all done… thank you, the listener, for listening. And thank me, Dan McCoy, for being here.  [Laughs.] [Multiple people laugh.] stuart And thank me, Stuart Wellington, for being here! elliott And I guess I’ll get—I’ll jump on this self-thanking train?  [Dan laughs.] crosstalk Stuart : Yeah, just try it! Try it, Elliott!  Elliott : And I’ll— elliott And I’ll say—I’ll say thanks—first I’ll say thanks again to our guest, Felicia Day, and I will say thanks—thank you, Hawk. For being the Slayer. We all needed you to be. I’m Elliott Kalan! For Flop House News. Dan? dan Goodnight! stuart Byeeeee! music Light, up-tempo, electric guitar with synth instruments. felicia Listen, I was just, uh, a little villager with a little tent and a dream. And I caught those butterflies and I mined those ore—rocks, and I played that terrible turnip game. But I did it! I did it for my baby!  [Stuart laughs.] elliott I mean, it sounds like a great game. speaker 1 MaximumFun.org speaker 2 Comedy and culture. speaker 3 Artist owned— speaker 4 —Audience supported.'"

       "'music “Switchblade Comb” by Mobius VanChocStraw. A jaunty, jazzy tune reminiscent of the opening theme of a movie. Music continues at a lower volume as April introduces herself and her guest, and then it fades out. april wolfe Welcome to  Switchblade Sisters , where women get together to slice and dice our favorite action and genre films. I’m April Wolfe. Every week, I invite a new female filmmaker on. A writer, director, actor, or producer, and we talk—in depth—about one of their fave genre films. Perhaps one that’s influenced their own work in some small way. And you may already know, but a reminder that we are remote recording now, and I am in my bedroom. Chicken is asleep, so she’s probably not gonna start screeching at us. You might hear some birds. The audio is likely going to sound a little different from our studio’s, but everything else is the same. Except for today, our great guest, who we’ve got—for some reason we keep getting all these wonderful people out of Australia. Director Shannon Murphy. shannon murphy Hi! april Um, so Shannon, for those of our listeners who are less familiar with your work, please let me give an introduction. Shannon is an award-winning theater and TV director, who graduated from the Australian Film and Television School in 2013. Her graduating short film,  Kharisma,  has screened at festivals, including Cannes and Tiff, and was nominated for an AACTA award. Shortly thereafter, she won a Sydney Theater Award for the Australian premiere of  My Name is Rachel Corrie . Most recently, Shannon has directed a number of episodes on Australian hit series, including  Rake, Love Child, Offspring,  and  Sisters.  Shannon was nominated for an Australian directors guild award for her role as the sole director of of the C—sorry, the SBS four-part mini-series,  On The Ropes . Her first feature film,  Babyteeth , which we’ll be talking about quite a bit on this episode, is produced by Jan Chapman, with Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn starring. Premiered in main competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2019, an dis one of the—ugh, god, this stat just kills me every single time I hear it.  [Laughs]  And is one of two female directed films in competition. And Toby Wallace was awarded the Marcello Mastroianni Award—that’s close enough—for best young actor or actors. He’s phenomenal in this film. It was then presented in competition at the BFI London Film Festival. The film was sold in a bidding war to IFC in the U.S. and Picturehouse in the U.K. She is currently working on  Killing Eve  for BBC America, Sid Gentle, and was named in Variety as one of ten directors to watch in 2020. So this is a big year for you. shannon Yeah. That’s for sure. Yes.  [Both laugh.]  It is, you know, and now you know, with the added pandemic, it’s just gotten bigger. I think it’s the most sort of operatic year I’ve ever had. april Um, so Shannon, the movie that you chose to talk about today is  Spring Breakers , and I was hoping you could give us a little explanation on why this is one of your fave genre films. shannon I was um, at AFFTS, the film school in Australia, when this came out in 2013, and I’d always really been into Harmony Korine’s films and found them so bold and um, you know, he doesn’t waste your time. There’s always something incredibly interesting going on in what he’s saying and how he’s shooting it, and I just know that I’m gonna walk out surprised and impressed. And so when I went to see  Spring Breakers  it just came at a perfect time in my learning. I was studying alternative cinema, and we had to write an essay on a film that we were interested in. And after I watched  Spring Breakers , that’s what I picked, because I really think um, a lot of the way he uses music and color and editing in this film is something that still inspires me today. And um, you know, he’s pushing the idea of the American dream in a way that is uh, you know, very theatrical in a sense, but feels more true and honest in its telling than a lot of things that have done the same. april Um, for those of you who haven’t seen  Spring Breakers  though, today’s episode will obviously give you some spoilers, but it shouldn’t stop you from listening before you watch. As always, my motto is that it’s not what happens, but how it happens that makes a movie worth watching. Still, if you would like to pause and watch  Spring Breakers  first, it’s on Canopy and you can go ahead and do that. music “Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites” by Skrillex april And now that you\\'re back, let me introduce  Spring Breakers  with a quick synopsis. Written and directed by Harmony Korine,  Spring Breakers  tells the story of four college friends, Brit, Candy, Cotty, and Faith. Faith, as her name implies, goes to religious youth group meetings. clip Youth Pastor:  Are you crazy for Jesus?  Kids in chorus:  Amen. Amen.  Youth Pastor:  Are you jacked up on Jesus? I am. I am. april While the other three party. They decide they have to get to Florida for spring break, and then to get there, they rob a restaurant with hammers and guns. clip Cotty:  Act like you’re in a movie or something. You can’t be scared of shit. You have to be hard. Don’t be scared of anything. Let’s just get this fucking money and go on spring break, y’all. april They get to St. Petersburg, and then start drinking and partying to excess. But very shortly afterwards, the cops come and bust them in a hotel room for drugs. Fortunately, or unfortunately for them, a local rapper named Alien bails them out— clip Brit:  Why are you here?  Alien:  I saw y’all on the air. You look like nice people. Thought maybe I’d bail you out. Everyone could use a little bailing out once in awhile.  Faith:  Why?  Alien:  Why not? april —and brings them to a club and his home to drink and play with his guns, as one does. clip Alien:  This is my fucking dream, y’all! All this shit. Look at my shit. I got—I got shorts, every fucking color. I got designer t-shirts.  [Girls are heard giggling.]  I got gold bullets. Mother fucking vampires. april Faith becomes uncomfortable and tries to convince her friends to leave, but is unsuccessful. clip Faith:  This is not what we came here for. We came here to have fun, and we came here to like, party.  Speaker 1:  This is fun.  [Mixed voices of dissent.] Faith:  It is not. This is not what it was supposed to be. It’s not fair to me, because this is not what I signed up for, and I’m very uncomfortable. april Faith then takes off on a bus home, and everyone else goes to a strip club, where Alien’s nemesis, Big Arch, hangs out. Big Arch tells Alien to stop selling drugs in his part of town— clip Alien:  Whatchu want me to do? Stay in your shadow all of my life?  Archie:  I want you buy a fucking surfboard, go back in the middle of the ocean, and disappear. Go back doing what white boys do, like robbing spring breakers. april —but Alien’s out for himself. Then later on, at Alien’s house, Brit and Candy engage in a violent fantasy by sticking the barrels of guns in Alien’s mouth and objectifying him. clip Candy:  We have everything we need right here.  Brit:  We don’t need you, Alien.  Candy:  What if we just used you to come here?  Brit:  What if we just—  Candy:  In five second, we just shoot you.  Brit:  Blow your brains out.  Candy:  And you’re dead. You’re gone.  Brit:  You’re dead.  Candy:  We have all your stuff. april They state they could kill him right there, but he ultimately chooses to go along with the fantasy. Alien takes the women to do a series of robberies after that, but Big Arch and his guys run into them, and they shoot Cotty. Cotty realizes she needs to get out, but Brit and Candy stay behind to have sex with Alien and then go on one last big heist to Big Arch’s place. They kill everyone, including Alien, then drive back home in Alien’s convertible, saying in a voiceover phone call to their parents that they’ve finally figured out who they really are. clip Candy:  I think we found ourselves here. We finally got to see some other parts of the world. We saw some beautiful things here. Things we’ll never forget. april As I usually say, this is a synopsis that you can’t really encapsulate what’s happening in this movie just by what happened. It’s a, you know, fairly oversimplified version of this. But um, one of the things that I wanted to talk about is the fact\\xa0 that you have these very well known like, child actors who are starring in this. And you know, first off we should say that the parents of these young actors are probably, I think, younger than Harmony Korine.  [Laughs.]  Like, Selena Gomez’s mother is younger than Harmony Korine and grew up on his films. And um, it was her mother who got her interested in the script. And she said, quote, “I was interested in why my mom really loved the script, and then we watched all of his movies together, and I watched a couple of his interview, and I just got extremely excited. I thought this was a great way to throw me into a huge acting—sorry, acting camp basically. It was going to be a low budget indie, and Harmony was going to give us opportunities to improv, and he let us play. That’s really refreshing and rare, and it was an actor’s dream in a way to start off like that.” End quote. Um, so for you, I’m curious about casting and whether or not you keep in mind how people, or actors specifically, are perceived already in the public before you’re even looking at them for a piece. shannon Yeah, definitely. I often think, for me, the goal is to—and similar I guess to _Spring Breakers—_is to take characters and actors that we think are a particular type of performer and surprise the audience to show something that we haven’t seen of theirs before. For example, with  Babyteeth , in Australia Ben’s very well known for um, doing comedic work, but overseas in America he’s often a villain or the black sheep of the family. And so I wanted the opportunity to show his comedic side again, and also that he’s such a beautiful father character. And the same with Eliza. You know, like in  Sharp Objects  and  Little Women  she’s very different, and I knew that she had this real sort of punk vibe to her that we could channel for  Babyteeth . And then you know, we—Toby was—it was—that was more about a character that you know, we can often judge in society. He’s a polysubstance drug abuser, and I wanted to make sure that we really could understand where his behavior was coming from, and also to not judge him for that, and to feel his generosity towards Milla more than anything else. april Yeah. And um, you know, we should say  Babyteeth  does involve a um, a teenage love affair, but in a very uh, in very strange circumstances. Because you have a girl who does have a terminal disease, and she wants to live life to its fullest, and that’s when she um, seeks out Toby’s character, who is um, both chaos and comfort to her. And the same to her family.  [Laughs.] shannon Yeah. And actually that’s a theme that’s similar in both films in a sense that it’s young people saying that I want something more than this. That’s something that the girls say a lot in  Spring Breakers , and you know, that—I get it. They’re bored and uninspired in this college town, and disenchanted by the education system. And you know, I love that shot where they’re staring into the sea of laptops which are glowing on their faces, like they’re plants being forced to grow in an unnatural sort of hydroponic environment. And I think Korine’s really making a statement about education is not where you learn about life, the same way he’s mocking the institute of religion and sort of talking about temptation a lot. And yet these girls in the story, they’re completely owning their violence and their own rage and sexuality, and that’s something that I really loved seeing as well. They’re not victims in this in any way. Um, they’re playing that character, Alien, just as much as he’s playing them. april Yes. There’s a tense—tenseness in your stomach. If you’re like, uh, well if you’re anyone who’s watching this and you’re like, “How is this gonna go?”  [April laughs, and Shannon affirms.]  Just like a kind of thankfulness of like, oh, it’s not how I thought. shannon No, yeah. They have the power, and that amazing sequence where um, they’re doing that ballet to Britney Spears, um, is such an iconic kind of image for the film. music “Switchblade Comb” by Mobius VanChocStraw. april Um, uh, we’re gonna take a quick break. When we come back, we’ll be talking a little bit more about  Spring Breakers  and also  Babyteeth [Music fades.] promo Music:  Faint, suspenseful violin music in background.

I’m April Wolfe, and I’m joined today by Shannon Murphy, and we’re talking about  Spring Breakers.  Okay, um, so in the break, I think Shannon brought up something that was really interesting, talking about the perception of this film from this point versus when it came out in 2013. And you know, the—how we are viewing his visuals and his male gaze. And you had said something interesting where—and I think what you’re trying to say is that it’s sometimes so over the top that it becomes acceptable in a sense, because it feels parodic, as opposed to sincere. Is that what you’re trying to say? shannon Totally. Um, yeah, he’s definitely um, because especially when Alien comes in to their lives, it feels like the performance style really ups a notch, and it does become quite operatic in a way. So no matter sort of what he’s, you know, the kind of voodoo spells in a way that he’s casting over them with all his repeated lyrics, um, they—they aren’t fully enchanted by him. Like, they do go along with him, but I do feel like they still always have\\xa0 their own power, and the ability to kill him as quickly as he could kill them. And I think um, yeah, post-sort of the Me Too conversation, I was really happy that the film still stood up as a powerful film for female protagonists, actually. april Do you—I think um, for me, I’m—I’m curious about what you’re saying of an operatic thing, because I think that there’s a melodrama at play here, that you know, we’re not supposed to take things necessarily always at face value. Um, there’s you know, there’s reality and then there\\'s unreality working against each other here. shannon Yeah, I think it’s that heightened level of design. Like when you think about Alien’s bedroom and the bed and all the weapons up on the wall, and the—the “look at all my shit” speech, and all of that is—it’s almost greater than melodrama for me. That’s why I call it operatic, because everything is so large. Like even the fact that there’s music like the entire—I think it’s the entire way through the film really. Um, yeah, it’s the performance style, because I guess melodrama could almost seem… twee in some way, but it’s like it—it just—it’s almost like it’s on steroids, you know? april The interesting thing that I was looking at when I was watching this movie, and then after, having watched  Babyteeth  too, is I can see a micro-cinematic experience happening in both of those. Like there’s a certain kind of compartmentalization that’s happening, in your movie and his, in terms of each scene is its own little kind of movie. And time is moving pretty quickly for your film as well. Um, you know, like there’s—like you hit an encapsulated moment here, like here’s a dinner scene, and then time speeds up, and then here’s this, and then here’s this. And so it feels like it’s a succession of micro-cinematic moments that are—that I can see compounding to this revelational ending. I was wondering if you could talk about that kind of thing. shannon Yeah, I mean I think both films definitely incorporate sort of bricked in techniques. I mean, with  Spring Breakers , there’s flashbacks and flash forwards and flagging what’s to come or subverting um, intrigue, you know, having intrigue for our expectations. But with  Babyteeth,  what we did was we used titles, and those titles are sometimes saying what’s to come, but sometimes they’re also Milla’s sort of inside voice, and other times toward the end of the film they become sort of more poetic and emotional. \\xa0And what both techniques do is that they get you to stop focusing on time, and they allow it to become more fluid and to move in a way that keeps you in character, I think, and in the heart of the story, rather than worrying so much about—it’s interesting he calls it linear narrative, because it’s— april I mean, it’s definitely for him. Everything is gonna be relative for what he thinks, right? shannon [Laughing]  Yeah. ‘Cause for him, it’s a linear film, but I think for other people it might not quite be. But—and also just that idea of um, you know, cutting out music quite abruptly, whereas instead he just sort of blasts it quite loudly and then pulls it back out. But um, it’s a very strong sound mix, and that’s something that I also work very hard on in my own work, is just keeping all those really sort of textured noises, so that you feel very much like you’re in—sort of in a documentary, no matter how theatrical the world might be that you’re watching. april When you’re g—I’m curious, because when you’re going over cuts of uh, you know, TV shows, like let’s say  Killing Eve —which music is a huge fucking part of that show and its identity, specifically licensing music. When you guys are going over those, you know, like the final cuts when you’re in post, what—what is your attitude about scoring, about licensed music. You know, do you have a big hand in deciding like, where these music cues can go? Like, what kind of control do you have over that type of thing when you’re working with TV? shannon Yeah, look, you know, it’s a good question. You have a lot of control, I think. Mainly because I work with an editor a lot called Steve Evans, and he and I have very strong feelings about music. And so we really push hard to keep the tracks that we have chosen. And we’re smart, you know, we do balance budgets and know how all that works with licensing music. But um, for example with my—episode five of  Killing Eve , which is when Villanelle returns home to Russia. We knew that that ep needed to sound quite different to the rest of the series, and David Holmes—he’s the composer for  Killing Eve . He’s amazing, and he was really on board with that. So that ep had much more sourced music than, I think, potentially any other episode has had, um, and it had to have a really unusual vibe that was both sort of nostalgic and in some ways um, really pulling at Villanelle’s heartstrings, but still having that subversive sort of comedic tone that that show has. Um, and so, you know, we got some music that was Europop, you know, famous sort of tracks, and sort of mixed that with old um, actually this beautiful American trumpet piece we used, and sort of a bit of a  Little House on the Prairie  vibe as a kind of joke comment there. But um, we were playing with a lot of things. And then with  Babyteeth  it’s like we needed what—a lot of different musical worlds. There’s a classic musical world that her mother is so in love with and has brought her daughter up to love, and then there’s the world music world of Gidon, the music teacher who is teaching her life lessons that she can’t learn at home. And then there’s just you know, the soundtrack of Milla and Moses, and what they’re into and what’s um, fueling their night out and their love for one another. It’s always about picking tracks too that don’t, for me, give everybody a memory of their own life. I do like to find original pieces that are less easy for all of us to jump onto. Having said that, like in  Spring Breakers  when they used the Britney Spears track, because we have never even considered seeing that song played with those images, then that becomes—that almost becomes the um, the only way now that you can ever see that song in your mind, I find. music \"Everytime\" by Britney Spears, performed by James Franco, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, and Rachel Korine  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you, baby And every time I see You in my dreams I see your face It’s haunting me... shannon So unless you’re really gonna do something incredible like that, I think what’s the point of using sort of too famous a song, in a way. april Yeah. It’s funny. When—when Korine was asked about getting the license to these songs, he said, quote, “I actually try not to pay attention to that kind of stuff. I put it in my request and they just tell me yes or no, and if they say no, I just push and say, ‘We gotta get it.’ Then they say no again, and I keep pushing until it’s either impossible to get or we get it.” End quote. So it’s this kind of—I don’t think he’s—at this point I don’t think he’s looking at the money. Like, he’s not keeping his eye on the budget. He’s got other people who are looking at that, so he can kind of be like, the thorn in people’s side and be like, “Make it work, make it work.” But if you are a director who’s still got your eye on the budget and you’re producing, and you’re like, “Okay, I know what this is, I know how to accommodate,” I think it’s like you’re maybe almost so aware that you don’t even want to push, does that happen? shannon No, I’ve never not pushed, to be honest. Like, I’m aware of the budget so that then I can know when I can push and really fight for the things that I want. Um, yeah, no, I would never back down on something as important as you know, having that song in there. And you know, often people do say no and then you just have to find another avenue. There’s a song in  Babyteeth  that we got told no about, and then I stalked all the original musicians online and then found ways to get to them, and then had our writer go down to the school where one of the recordings first happened and like, harass the staff here until we kind of got an answer. And then we could re-record it, and we did, and it’s in the film. april Oh, wow. That’s great.  [Laughs.] shannon You’ve just got to be—you’ve just got to be obsessive. april I like that you were able to re-record it though, because even if you can’t get the rights to that production, you can get the rights otherwise. If you need that melody, if you need that song, you can find another way to put it into your movie. shannon Totally, and I think most directors are you know, pretty crazy like that. Like I’m—that play that you mentioned in my bio,  My Name Is Rachel Corrie , I got rejected for directing that and um, they said, oh we’re not gonna give you the rights. I had just graduated drama school. But, at 3am I just wrote this rant to the people who had the rights, saying how dare you not give them to me, you know, who do you think you are, this story’s so important, why would you not give them to me, blah blah blah. I just went off, I didn’t even spellcheck it, and I just sent it, and I was like, “Oh, I feel better.” And I woke up the next morning, and they were like, “Rachel Corrie, it’s a true story, you know, her parents have looked at this email and they’d be delighted to give you the rights.” So at the end of the day you just like—there are really good reasons to push back, you know? So I think it\\'s important. Sometimes it’s—you know, no doesn’t mean no.

I’m April Wolfe, and I’m joined today, from Australia, by Shannon Murphy, and we’re talking about  Spring Breakers.  So um, we mentioned this a little bit earlier, but the way that he was working on this movie was full of improvisation. So I wanted to bring up a quote about that, and this is from Selena Gomez. She said, quote, “It’s safe to say that sixty percent was definitely figured out, and was what Harmony envisioned and wanted. For the rest, we were thrown in real situations. It was every day that it would happen, though. Harmony would find something, a light post or a gas station or a convenience store, and he’d walk in and ask, ‘Can we film here?’ And they’d say okay, and then we’d walk in and he’d say, ‘The lights are great, so maybe sing a song or just say nothing and look at each other really intensely.’” End quote. I think pretty much uh, all—all four of those actors, um, were saying that one of the things that they appreciated about this particular shoot, and about his method of improvisation and kind of seat-of-your-pants types of things is that got them out of their heads, because they were actors who, as child actors, were very into their heads of like, how they’re appearing, how they should um, make a face to look cute, or to appeal to like, a certain audience. And you know, just very aware of who they are in the world and thinking about that constantly. And so one of the things that Selena Gomez said was, quote, “I was definitely one of those actors where I was just critiquing every single thing I did and making sure I had every line down pat, so Harmony just really wanted to throw that all away. He never wanted me to be in my mind. That’s what I definitely appreciate. It allowed me to go to these places that I didn’t really think I could go to, not just saying the bad thing, but more the emotional scenes that I had to give myself to in a bikini and in that way. And then having James Franco’s character come was just really frightening, so if anything, I’ve just learned to not be in my head as much. To just take it as it goes, and to just be in the surroundings and work off of that.” End quote. For you, even when you’re not doing improvisation with actors and you’re working off a very secure script, um, I mean you still have to manage to get people out of their heads. I mean, even professionals sometimes, like people who have just been doing this for years and years and years. So, you know, how do you do that? shannon Well I don’t improvise off script, but I improvise physical moments and private moments for characters, and there’s still, I think, a huge amount of improvisation that happens um, even if you’re not just doing it with dialogue. And every actor’s so different, but there are are a lot that do get in their heads, and I think the way to get them out of it is um, you know, always assuring them that what they’re doing is enough and they can pull back. And sometimes it’s about having those really tough conversations with them on set. Like, there was a scene in  Babyteeth  where Moses’ son, at night, comes back into Milla’s bedroom and um, you know, Toby’s so directable, but he was getting—he was getting trapped, and I think it was ‘cause maybe he had an idea of how it was gonna play out. It was a very long scene as well. And he was just falling into sort of a bit of a pattern, which is not something that ever happens for him, and so I knew he must be trapped in his head. And I just sometimes have to have a really hard word with them and really sort of point out what’s not working. And it is—it’s sort of tough, but he came straight back in and then just gave the performance that we used, because you know, I just told him, “No, that’s not what this scene is, and you need to take out anything that you’re thinking because it’s not—it’s not what I think is right for this moment.” And he’s brilliant, like he just went, “Okay, okay, okay.” You know, and he just has to let it all go.  [April laughs.]  Yeah, he’s just like, “Alright, alright, alright, okay.” Um, and then he’s like, “Get away from me.”  [Laughs.]  You know, ‘cause he needs his—you know, they need their space. It’s, you know, and I completely respect that. I’m like yeah, and it’s annoying to be told that, you know, that what you’re doing isn’t quite right, but that you know, that’s what you’re there for, and it\\'s wonderful. And afterwards, he felt, too, you know? It was great. But yeah, I think um, every actor you have to analyze pretty quickly and work out what they need, and how you’re gonna then support that. You know, Eliza’s super intellectual, too. She can get in her head. But you just—she can get herself out of it with enough sort of takes, whereas you know, someone like Ben doesn’t. april Do they ever try to intellectualize the characters, or— shannon Um, yeah, it’s more in the moments. You can see them thinking and probably what they’re thinking about is quite right for the character, but it might not be totally connecting to what they’re doing in that exact moment. It’s so easy when they’ve got so much you know, crew and everything else going on in front of you to suddenly pop slightly out of yourself. And that’s why I like to just keep rolling. I hate cutting too much so that they can keep going straight into another one, straight into another one. And to also give themselves an opportunity to do a real range of takes, so they don’t just feel trapped in my idea or their idea. april Well, I mean, that also seems to kind of coincide with the theater background, if I’m correct. The ability to—I mean like, you’re hitting your marks still, but you’re you know, you’re not trying to do the same thing every take. shannon Completely, and I think even my theater work used to be really quite chaotic in its energy and I um, I love that. You know, I would say to my actors if I was coming in to watch it, as I do once a week, you know, I’d say, “Please let me see at least three things that I’ve never seen before from each of you, just so that I can be entertained.”  [Laughs]  But you know, it’s true. I want them to not get stuck, you know, it’s really important for actors to also own their performances. april I like that as a thing. Make me entertained now.  [Both laugh.] shannon I remember, yeah, you know, Sarah Snook who’s the brilliant actress in  Succession , she’s Australian, and she was in one of my first plays. And I remember saying that to her, and I came in and she uh, started doing some of the monologue in a hand stand, and I was like, “Not that different!”  [Laughs.]  But I loved it, and I thought, “Serves me right.” april [Laughing]  Yeah. As we uh, kind of move on towards the end of this, I wanted to at least touch on the fact that this was— Spring Breakers  was shot on different film formats. He was experimenting in format as well as form and everything else. So, he said, quote, “We were shooting everything on 35 millimeter film, and then I was experimenting with these Japanese novelty cameras called Powershovels.” I have not heard of that. “And basically we’d just buy tons of them and make what were sort of like totems attached to the main camera, and they all switched on to different functions. So we were filming in black and white, and in sepia tones, and whatever you’d call a 1970s look, all simultaneously. “I wasn’t sure how I could use the cameras, or if I could use them, in a way that wouldn’t be annoying. So my assistant editor came up with this sort of composite morphing image shots, and started playing around with them on an avid, and then I thought they looked perfectly trippy like hallucinations, and I liked them for the drug sequences. They serve as almost hallucinatory punctuation and they look like melting film.” End quote. Um, for him, I don’t think—I don’t think those cameras were particularly expensive, so it was an easy way for him to just say like, well, toss away, maybe this works and maybe this doesn’t. But I do like the impulse to say, “I’m going to try it, and if it doesn’t work, we can abandon it, but we will try it and then give this to an editor, Like what do you have? Like, could you make something would this, would it be meaningful?” shannon Yeah, and like, I don’t use this word often, but that’s why I think in many ways he’s a genius, because he is a true risk taker. And that is something that people often say they are but they don’t really do that. And he is willing to fail, and I really liked that mix of um, those different styles of the film, especially that one you’re talking about, the kind of melting one when the twins are um, throwing that party, and you can see everyone start—it sort of almost goes into animation, and they start sort of—their faces start sliding away. And I thought, I said to myself, “What is that? That looks amazing.” Um— april And it’s these dumb Japanese cameras!  [Laughs.] shannon And um, I think that’s what’s cool. Like you know, I think that’s why everybody would want to jump on making a project with him, because you don’t know what you’re gonna get, and you’re not you know, going in thinking, okay, it’s gonna be this kind of project. And so it keeps everyone pushing themselves to be the most interesting artist that they can be, and I think that’s the always the most thriving environment working. april Does that inspire you in any way? Like, if you had—if you had the chance to feel like you could fail in that way, where you could take chances? shannon Oh, totally. I mean, I think like that with all my work, really. Um, I don’t mind—yeah, I’m not afraid of failure, because I know it’s such an important part of um, you know, trying something new. And I do say to all my heads of department whenever we get together at the beginning of a process, please, let’s all come to the table with something that we’ve never done before, that we want to experiment with in this project. Um, and so yeah, we do that, and we try to incorporate it then into our sort of rules of the style of work we’re wanting to make. And we do a retreat at the beginning of our process where it’s just us. We go off and stay in some house in the middle of nowhere, and we eat and drink and watch movies and look at photography books and just sort of jam for two or three days, and then are all in sympatico about what we’re doing. So that when things start getting really tricky on set or start falling apart or who knows, um, we can all remind each other what we were talking about on that weekend and what we’re aiming for. april Maybe like one note taker who’s just like, “There’s a reason why we’re doing this, if you forgot.”  [Both laugh.] shannon Completely. Yeah. And it’s great, it’s really liberating, because you know, we then just say, “Oh, remember that thing we talked about that we wanted to experiment with?” And we go, “Yeah, let’s do that.” And so, you know, we always find a time for those things. We never uh, let—let the project run away with us without having given us a go. april I’m so happy that you were able to come and talk to us today about both  Spring Breakers  and your movie,  Babyteeth . And I was hoping you could tell people how they can see  Babyteeth shannon Um, well  Babyteeth  is coming out in the U.S. on June 19th through IFC, and then it’ll be in Australia on July 23rd through Universal Pictures. april Yes. So, I think in the U.S. you guys can check some drive-in theaters, and then also some—you can rent it on VOD, so, um, check it out there. Uh, it’s a nice—it’s a nice companion if you guys were listening to Essie Davis’ episode as well. Um, because you’ve probably been wondering what was the other movie that we were talking about, too. It’s coming out now! Uh, okay. Thank you so much for coming on and I hope that you have a lovely time in Australia right now.  [Laughs.] shannon Thanks. Yeah, and I hope America gets better soon. april Hey, thank you. music “Switchblade Comb” by Mobius VanChocStraw. april And thank you for listening to  Switchblade Sisters . Um, as you know, if you’ve been listening lately, we’ve started recommending a new female-directed film for all of you outside of the movie that we’re talking about that day. Um, and you know, I’m trying to keep it thematically linked. Um, but again, we are highlighting all great work of women filmmakers, and this episode I would really love to\\xa0 recommend Lynne Ramsay’s  You Were Never Really Here.  It’s a movie—a quiet, strangely quiet of a poem of a violent film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, that did not get its credit or box office due. And it is so wonderful, and Lynne Ramsay handles violence and compassion and empathy in these really strange ways. She has to juggle all of them, but it’s also, in the same way that we’re talking about Harmony Korine’s film being experimental and full of sound and sonic deviances, so is  You Were Never Really Here . Lynne Ramsay is by far one of my favorite filmmakers for the whole kind of global view, the way that she thinks about film, and this is just, I think, a masterpiece of that. So, if you want to let us know what you think of the show, you can tweet at us @SwitchbladePod or email us at  SwitchbladeSisters@maximumfun.org . Please check out our Facebook group.
