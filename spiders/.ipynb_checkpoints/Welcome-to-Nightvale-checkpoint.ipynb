Yay!\\xa0', 'I mean, death is still physically possible of course, but municipally frowned upon. So be a good citizen and hang in there.', \"Annette Jacoby, director of Night Vale’s Prince of Sorrow Funeral Home, is already preparing for a potentially long period of unemployment by taking a creative writing class at the community college. “I've always wanted to be a novelist,” Jacoby remarked. She then added with a toothy grin, “I have lots experience with \", '.” A long silence followed as her smile faded slowly. We wish you all the best, Annette.', \"Likewise, Al Kincaid, the Grave Digger, plans to spend more time with his daughter, Sophia, now that his evenings won't be occupied by ceaselessly making holes for decorated corpses. He timidly suggested a family game night, to which his daughter rolled her eyes in annoyance even though she was secretly pleased.\", '###', 'With the news that Rattlesnake Rest has been completely filled, I thought we should have a retrospective of our favorite graves.', 'Like all cemeteries, this one is located at the end of a winding dirt road. And like all cemeteries, the grounds are tangled with dense vegetation in the middle of a desolate, howling plateau. It is a normal cemetery, with a chill in the air even on the hottest summer day and an impenetrable darkness even on the brightest full moon-ed night. And nearly everyone buried here died somewhere else. Nearly everyone.', 'The most important grave in the cemetery lies at the southwest corner. It is the grave around which all the other graves were built. Instead of a formal headstone, it is marked by a gaping hole in the earth and a broken wooden sign that reads Rattlesnake Mineshaft. Seventeen miners are buried here. All of them headless. To understand the history of this important grave, we go to the year 1851.', 'The new player-piano in the Earl Street Saloon was on its tenth repetition of ', \". The first few times, the rowdy patrons sang along but now no one could get it to stop and the song was putting everyone on edge. It seemed to get louder with each verse, more frantic with each chorus. At least that's how it felt to saloon owner Tamsen Zylphia. She tried to drown out the pounding chords with whiskey, which worked, but it also made everyone sad and chatty. Talk soon turned to the topic of the missing miners. A group of seventeen siblings had come in on the train from nearby Red Mesa. They had been working their claim out at Rattlesnake Mine but hadn't been heard from in several weeks. Some folks thought they must have struck it rich and were busy kissing their numerous gold ingots, or whatever it is wealthy gold barrons did. No one in the poor town of Night Vale was sure how the other half lived, but they were certain that if they had gold ingots, it would not make sense not to kiss them. But some feared something tragic had taken place in that mine.\\xa0\", 'At some point that night, the player piano stopped abruptly and a faint skittering sound could be heard outside. When Tamsen and her saloon patrons investigated, they were shocked to witness a gleaming army of human skulls running over the desert toward them on tiny thrashing legs. It was a family of seventeen hermit crabs, wearing the new shells they had discovered out in Rattlesnake Mine, some still hanging with ribbons of flesh.', 'The settlers of the unincorporated township of Night Vale decided the collapsed mineshaft was as good a place as any to establish an official cemetery. There were already seventeen skull-less bodies buried there, which was a higher concentration than any of the other random collections of bodies buried around town at that time. And so Rattlesnake Rest was born. The town blacksmith commemorated the event by constructing a wrought-iron fence for the new cemetery, featuring a beautiful decorative inlay of a skull-wearing hermit crab harbinger on the front gate.', '###', \"Listeners, I’ve just been handed some breaking news. Smokehouse Brisket Sliders are back! Slow-smoked for thirteen succulent hours, topped with aged gouda, crispy onions, barbecue sauce and mayo. At Arby's for a limited time only. You never know when they're going to show up, you never know when they're going to disappear again. And when they do disappear, you don't know if they're ever coming back. But they're here now. And when they're here, everything feels right. Isn't that good enough for you? Can't you just live in the moment? Don't ruin things by asking for a bigger commitment. Let your hair down and get wild with Smokehouse Brisket Sliders. Only at Arby’s. And only when we say so. Got it?\\xa0\", '###', 'Back to our retrospective of Rattlesnake Rest.\\xa0', \"Opposite the old mineshaft is the grave of the Town Crier. It's a modest grave, with its crumbling headstone and faded Latin inscription: clamor viventem est: vivus est clamor. Which is supposed to mean “Crying is living, living is crying” but I've been told by my niece Janice's friend Marcy, who attends Catholic school, that it actually translates to something more like “cry creature is living outcry”. Which doesn't make a lot of sense. The Town Crier was a tortured individual, employed by the city to walk aimlessly through the streets, ringing a bell and weeping openly. After his death, many residents said they could still hear his sobs floating upon the early morning air.\", \"And in a large crypt at the back, shrouded by a grove of whispering elms, lies the Mahalla family. The Mahalla family owned a very important video store annex inside the Ralph's back in the 1990s. They kept a melted VHS copy of the movie \", 'displayed on the front counter to warn people against keeping videotapes inside of hot cars, lest they incur a hefty fee. We have never forgotten that valuable lesson.', '###', \"Listeners, a breaking news update. The Arby's drive-thru is closed until further notice. The same teal Honda Civic keeps entering and re-entering the drive-thru, ordering and reordering the Smokehouse Brisket Slider. Although he’s ordered over seven hundred sliders and counting, the driver expresses how hungry he is during each appearance, before frowning and glancing nervously at his watch, and there's no Arby's packaging visible in the car. The cashier theorized that the driver, identified as Jim Saling (pronounced like “sailing a ship”) of Desert Elm Drive, is stuck in a time loop and has not actually retained any of the sliders, despite each order being successfully charged to his credit card. After the employees expressed concern for Saling’s plight, everyone gathered together for a briefing on the situation.\\xa0\", '“Maybe the pity we feel for him is wrong,” suggested shift manager Sigrid Borg, who was recently awarded Employee of the Month for her positive attitude and dovelike white wings, with which she gloriously soars through the golden afternoon skies.\\xa0', '“Maybe getting to order his favorite Smokehouse Brisket Slider after such a long absence from the menu was the happiest moment of his life,” Borg said. “And now Jim gets to relive that moment over and over again as if for the first time.”\\xa0', \"The employees huddled up, chanted softly, and broke apart, sufficiently motivated to continue selling sliders to Saling that he will presumably never get to eat. Arby's is advising that all other customers please come inside the restaurant to order at this time, and thanks you for your understanding.\", '###', 'And now, I have here an exclusive excerpt from ', ', the upcoming YA horror novel by Night Vale Funeral Home director, Annette Jacoby.\\xa0', '“Chapter One. On the outskirts of town, there was an old, dark house. Everyone said it was abandoned, but Claire Delmonico swore she saw things moving past the windows at night. Not just things. A girl. Maybe even a girl her age. Claire was new in town, and all she really wanted was to make a friend. A real friend, someone she could have sleepovers with and make brownies with and dance to WAP with.\\xa0', '“Claire was the child of a funeral home director, and the only guests that were ever invited into their house were already dead. One day, brave with desperation, Claire marched up the crumbling steps to the old, dark house and rang the bell. A girl answered, tall and pale, with long hair that hung across her face.', '“’Whattup?’ the girl asked softly, barely looking Claire in the eye.', '“Claire explained that she had just moved in next door and was wondering if anyone lived here. ‘Ha ha ha,’ the tall girl said, ’I guess you could say someone ', \"here.’ Claire laughed too, though she didn't understand the joke. She needed a friend, and a weird friend was better than no friend at all.”\", \"Annette is still shopping to publishers, if anyone has any leads. Oh, and if it helps, Annette's creative writing instructor at the community college wrote “Pretty good” on her last assignment. Once again, we wish you all the best, Annette.\", '###', 'More breaking news. The Night Vale City Council is under investigation for misconduct.', 'Leaked surveillance footage from the Arby’s has revealed the council soliciting a free Smokehouse Brisket Slider.', \"In the video, which has gone viral, the cashier is seen refusing the request from a single being with multiple heads and arms, which is clearly the Night Vale City Council. There aren’t many other entities who meet that very specific description, except for the McReynolds Family over on East Bedford Rd. But the McReynolds are vegans. The cashier’s refusal prompted the council\\xa0 to tap their collective chest several times in a self important manner. The cashier again declined to serve them, citing Arby's Constitution Article 5 Section 1, which as we all learned in 7th grade civics, grants Arby's employees the power to declare war, enter alliances with foreign powers, and disallow free sandwiches to government employees for any reason the cashier sees fit, barring a two-thirds vote by shareholders.\", 'The City Council became belligerent, yelled the S-word, crushed a sauce packet beneath their fist, wept, hugged the confused cashier, rapidly blinked in and out of existence, and eventually fled the restaurant, dragging the rest of its many heads and arms behind.', \"The video then shows a baby raccoon entering the restaurant through the open door, eating lettuce scraps underneath a table, and falling fast asleep. Which is unrelated but super cute. If you haven't seen the video yet, you should really check it out. Or you could just go down to Arby's. The raccoon is still there. I've named it Honeymustard.\", '###', \"And now, more on Rattlesnake Rest. Since the cemetery has been declared full, we’ve all been freed from the bondage of certain death. Of course, there are a few people who aren't exactly happy about this.

Al learns that she’s been winning ribbons in spelling bees for years at her school. He’s proud of her, but he doesn't know how to say it. Instead, he grunts and nods and gets dirt on the furniture.

But unlike Carlos, the green stain covered Jessie’s whole body, not only his hands, indicating he had used it to walk through walls rather than merely reach through a door.\", \"Carlos explained that he had Jessie in his lab many times. Jessie and all of my employees come to my house regularly for dinners. (Like I said, they're family to me.) Jessie had taken an interest in Carlos' science projects, so Carlos\\xa0 showed Jessie his doorless-fridge experiment. Not long after that, Carlos noticed that the rest of his intangibility gel was gone. He thought he had just run out, even though he had made plenty of it. It never occurred to Carlos until he saw Jessie's green face a few days ago that Jessie had stolen it to remove the money from the vault and his criminal colleagues from their jail cell.\\xa0\", \"While I was the only person with the key to the vault, Jessie - as security guard - was the only person with master keys for the rest of the building. My office door is never locked, so I don't carry a key for it. Jessie knew this and locked me into my own office. Then his three collaborators - Richard, William, and Emma - created a fake robbery of the cash tills to distract from his heist of the vault.\\xa0\", 'Sheriff Sam was impressed with Carlos’s explanation and arrested Jessie McNeil on the spot. Jesse turned to Carlos and Sam and said: \"I guess I\\'m going to jail now.\"\\xa0', 'And Sam said: \"Don\\'t flatter yourself.\"', \"Anyway, I finally get to return home, thanks to my brother-in-law, Carlos.

Welcome to Night Vale', 'I’m excited today for the annual Night Vale Children’s Fun Fact Science Presentation. Yes, that’s right, as we’ve done every year on this day, we will be devoting our entire episode to a scientific narrative that is sure to delight both the young and the young at heart and also those who have stolen young hearts and incorporated them into your flesh sacks.', 'For this year’s Children’s Fun Fact Science Presentation, we will be looking into the history of the space race. My husband Carlos has been helping me research this, (thanks honey!) and so it should be airtight and without error.\\xa0', 'Now, the Space Race truly began in 1782, at a garden party hosted by the first Duke of Luftnarp one lazy July weekend. A group of bored noblepeople were sitting out in the garden, in all their ruffles and wigs, looking absolutely fashionable for the time and absolutely ridiculous to modern eyes. Soon the conversation turned, as it often does at parties, to how much they all hated the moon.', '“Stupid moon,” said one.', '“Lousy orb,” added another.', '“Why, I loathe that sky rock,” said a third.', 'Then they started to throw things at the moon, to demonstrate how much they hated it. But none of the objects they threw, not the champagne glasses nor the decorative party masks nor the dangerous knives, came anywhere near the moon. Most of the hurled items followed the tedious arc of gravity back into the party, with mixed results for the attendees, some of whom required immediate medical attention.\\xa0', '“This won’t do,” said the first Duke of Luftnarp. “We must hit the moon square on with our objects of derision.”', '“Let us endeavor,” said the Prince of York, “to build an object that can make it all the way to the moon and smack that awful rock right across its ugly surface. The first one to do so will show that indeed they hate the moon the most.”', 'There was general cheering to that remark, along with some moaning from those who had been struck by the falling objects.', 'And thus the space race was born.', 'And now the news. As I’m sure we’ve all been following, there is a presidential race going on. Yes, Night Vale may be a small town mostly preoccupied with the banal goings on of our day to day life, but we are not unaware of national stories. Just like any other town, we have our own opinions on the presidential race, and spirited debates are held weekly in the Compressed Spine Amateur Boxing Gym. Winner is generally by knock out, although occasionally a winner has to be chosen by points. I myself am a strong supporter of Spotless Tony, who I think has the best positions, including banning guns, legalizing writing utensils, and Medicare for Spotless Tony, a program that would provide comprehensive healthcare to himself. Others may support Heartbreak Maggie, and I do see the arguments for her. She has the most number of arms, the most number of eyes, and her singing voice literally kills. In any case, I think we can all get together on one thing. Old Towel Leonard has got to go. Get him out there. Ugh, Old Towel Leonard.', 'This has been the news.', 'And now traffic,', 'Lift your eyes, pilgrims. See above you, another world awaits. This world has grown tired. This world has grown restless. This world has less color and more dust. Lift your eyes, pilgrims. See above you, another world awaits.', 'Get to that other world by any means, pilgrims. For what are pilgrims without their pilgrimage? What is anyone without a destination? You must lift yourself up to that other place.', 'Gather your supplies, pilgrims. Strip this world bare in order to raise yourself up. Take every scrap around you and put it toward that other world. This is all that matters. It’s all that matters to you, and so it is all that matters.', 'Aloft, pilgrims. You have done it. From here, the sweep of the universe presents itself.', 'Cast down your eyes, pilgrims. See below you the world you left behind. The world you stripped bare to make this journey. There was found all the conditions of life. Up here is only a cold, lonely hollow. Why did you ever feel you needed to leave? But ah well, ah well. For what are pilgrims without their pilgrimage?\\xa0', 'This has been traffic.', 'Let us now continue with our Children’s Fun Fact Science Presentation: the history of the Space Race.', 'The Space Race went on through the 18th and 19th centuries, with the rich and poor alike trying to be the first to successfully throw something at that horrible moon. The most obvious methods were quickly tried and discarded. Catapults only managed to cause collateral damage to neighboring homes. Gunpowder only backfired on the scientists involved, often quite literally. One woman, the Archduchess of the Motley Meadows, believed that she could reach the moon through dreaming. Every night, she performed a series of meditations that allowed her to have lucid control of her dreams. In those dreams, she would fly upward, each time getting a little closer to the dumb old moon. It was her belief that when she reached the moon in her dream, she would attain the same goal in real life. But the moment she finally touched the moon in her dream, she awoke to find herself in the stifling darkness of a coffin. It seems she had died several decades before, but still she dreamed. Having ascertained that there was no way back from the grave, she performed the meditations and fell into one final, endless lucid dream.', 'And that basically sums up the space race up until 1953.\\xa0', 'Now for a word from our sponsors.\\xa0', 'Today’s show is brought to you by Borders Books and Music.\\xa0', 'Remember the old days? When your legs were shorter but your life stretched longer? When the shadows were less dark and the lights less bleary? When the internet was a secret club and not a poison chalice?

What you are now we used to be; what we are now you will be.', 'This has been a word from our sponsors.', 'The lawsuit in the case of the estate of Franklin Chen vs the City of Night Vale continues apace.', 'The suit is currently in the discovery phase, which has been made difficult by the fact that the apparent murderer of Franklin Chen, Hiram McDaniels, has not been seen in Night Vale for years. Not since…the incident. And all records in Night Vale are top secret, so every time the lawyers for the Chen family try to see one, they have to dodge the laser grid and tranq darts that surround every filing cabinet in City Hall. Those lawyers have filed an injunction against the city to try to force them to turn the laser grids off, but as the official Night Vale motto, written by the town founders hundreds of years ago, clearly states: “Laser Grids or Death.”', 'More news on this lawsuit as news is made by this lawsuit.', 'Back to the space race!', 'Affairs continued with little success until 1953, when the United States, descendants of the Prince of York, decided that enough was enough and established the North American Slap-the-Moon Agency, or NASA, dedicated to developing the skills and technology needed to give that horrible orbiter what-for. Meanwhile the Russians, descendants of the Duke of Luftnarp, started their own agency designed to kick the moon in the you-know-what. And so a bet between two bored aristocrats became a global race, as they both tried to be the first to aim missiles at that sad little planetoid. To represent us, we chose Neil Armstrong. He was a test pilot, and he reportedly hated the moon more than anyone. Above his bed, he kept a National Geographic picture of the moon (the caption: “Can this celestial trash ever be put in its place?”) which he had drawn a huge red X through. Below that he wrote: “Darn you moon.” Which was the strongest language that existed in the 1950s.', 'Finally all was prepared. Neil Armstrong and his fellow astronauts boarded the rocket. All was quiet. Then all was loud.', 'More soon, but now for this week’s word jumble. The following nonsense words will, when their letters are rearranged, produce a simple phrase we all know well. Here we go:', '“Before I went into the cave, the prospect of the cave became so monstrous in my head that I dreamed about it for weeks. In my dreams, I was just outside of the cave, and I knew that the moment I stepped into the cave, my life would be over. But I also knew I could not delay my journey into the cave. I shook and shook with fear, and in my shaking, awoke myself. This happened night after night. Then came the day of our expedition, and to my horror, as I stood outside of the cave, the same dread certainty came to me. As soon as I stepped one foot into the crevice before me, my life would be over. I shook and shook, but I did not awaken, for I was not asleep but in the terrible dream we call life.”', 'So there it is. Just take those nonsense words apart and rearrange them into the phrase we’re looking for. If you think you have the answer, you probably do. Great job!', 'Before we go, the answer to last week’s jumble was: Hop! The Window Shakes Slyly! Look Here!', 'Which is, of course, the title of Dave Eggers’s new book of essays about blockchains.\\xa0', 'This has been this week’s word jumble.', 'We near the end of our story on the Space Race. Neil Armstrong and his comrades hunched in this tiny capsule that, absurdity of all absurdities, was about to be launched through void to lifeless rock. Sweat on his nose. Sweat on his lips. Then sweat in his mouth. This was all unnecessary. The history of humanity did not require us to physically touch everything there is. But some drive made him willing to risk his life, the only life he would ever get, in order to go far away and then come back again. There was a sound. There was a fire. There was a pressure. And then there was an absence of pressure. And they were at the moon. The lander careened its way to the surface. Neil, sweat still on his face, placed one foot on the moon. “I have a small foot,” he said. “But humanity, metaphorically, has big feet. Big huge metaphoric feet.” History would record and repeat these poetic words.\\xa0', 'Neil looked about him. He had done it. He had been the first one to smack into this disgusting space rock. All around was gray, and above that black, and within that, unnervingly distant, blue and green. And then…Neil saw.\\xa0', 'What Neil saw in a moment. But we really should and we really must go to the weather.', '[WEATHER: “Have a Smoke” by ', ']', 'Neil’s breath made shapes on the inside of his helmet. Some part of him felt that it was not even him on the moon, but that he was merely watching someone else’s body through a little window. That other him stepped forward, and saw something truly odd. It was a house. Solidly built, two floors, a front door, and gable windows. As he looked at it in disbelief, he realized that it was one of many. An entire town, all cleverly camouflaged from above with gray and black mesh, so that it would appear through telescopes to be merely the awful boring surface of the awful boring moon. He was not the first one on the moon after all. Who had come before?', 'He walked through the town, though it appeared abandoned. He stood in the middle of the main square. And he said, though he would not be able to be heard through the helmet and the thin atmosphere, “hello?”', 'In every window appeared an animal. Dogs, cats, snakes, hamsters, and parrots. So many animals, all watching him silently, regarding him from the windows of their little town. One cat, gray as the moon itself, hopped from her ledge and came over to him.\\xa0', '“I am Barbara Emmaline Quendaline Sauce,” said the cat, “but you may call me Barb E.Q. Sauce.”', 'Neil said, “you can talk?” and then he said “well apparently you can. I don’t know why I asked.”', 'The cat continued, as though he had not spoken. “This is our city. We are the lost pets of your world. We are lost because that is what we chose to be. We came here so we could be lost forever. Tell no one.”', 'Neil didn’t know what to say. All of his training had been about zero g maneuvering and the best way to hit the stupid moon when he got there. Nothing about how to interact with a cat that wanted him to keep a secret.', '“Please,” the cat repeated. And Neil nodded.', 'Not knowing what else to do, he went back to the lander, climbed in, and looked at the other man who had made this journey with him. Lee Marvin looked back at him with gentle eyes.', '“Lee,” Neil said, “you’re not going to believe this.”', '“A secret lost pet city on the moon,” Lee said.', '“Well,” Neil said, “uh, yes.”', 'Lee nodded thoughtfully. “Better leave them to it then,” he said. “Probably better we keep this between us.” Lee did not look surprised. It seemed to Neil that maybe Lee was there precisely to ensure that this secret was kept. And so again Neil only nodded, and they made their preparations and left.\\xa0', 'As they launched, out of the tiny window, Neil could just barely see thousands of animal eyes looking up at him. “I’ll keep your secret,” he whispered. “I’ll keep your secret.”', 'And he did. He never told anyone. Neither did Lee. No one knows this story. No one has ever heard it.', 'This has been the Children’s Fun Fact Science Presentation.', 'Good night, Night Vale. Good night.']\n",

Cooking dinner, catching up on all the popular shows like Lupin, Blown Away, and even old episodes of The Office. Not the American one, but the original Luftnarp version where the main character is a one-eyed starling voiced by film legend Lee Marvin. It’s much more cutting in its humor. My favorite episode is when the whole staff learns to summon the Lost Souls of the Ancient Ones, and the starling sings a dirge about drowning in a lake.

On Saturday, we drove a few hours north to Redwood Remains State Park. We brought our little Esteban with us, because it’s never too early to introduce children to nature. It was a fun and spiritually rewarding trip. And there’s nothing like the mighty heights of centuries-old trees to make you feel small like a baby, held close and tight, protected from the dangers in the malicious sky above.', 'I feel so refreshed. I can’t recommend the woods enough. What a rewarding time to spend with a family. It’s a trip that will stay with me forever. More on my hike soon.', '###', 'But let’s have a look now at traffic. At the intersection of High St and McDowell sits a 2004 Honda CRV, silver, with a broken taillight. Inside the car is a man named Sergei. He’s looking at the night sky. He does not see the light change from red to green. Nor does he notice this process repeating. There is no one behind him to indicate his attention should be otherwise paid to the road. The intersection of High St and McDowell is curiously empty except for the man in his 2004 CRV.', 'If anyone else were around, and they were to look at the same night sky, they would see blackness and stars, the faint slit of a nearly-new moon. They may see an airplane or the wisp of a cloud. Yet Sergei sees something that anyone else would not. Sergei sees a triangle of bright orange lights. They do not move, nor blink. They simply are an inscrutable pyramid perched in the firmament. Sergei wonders if they are extra-terrestrial or just a trick of the eye. The traffic signal changes from red back to green, and the CRV does not move. No one else is around.', 'He is scared. He is hopeful too. Sergei hopes that he is to be abducted. Saved even. Taken away from his job, and his wife, and his dogs, and his family. Taken away from his CRV with its broken taillight. Taken away from High St and McDowell. He doesn’t know if the alien craft would imprison him, experiment on him, or even kill him. Everything that is unknown is hope.\\xa0', 'Sergei does not pray, he only thinks of the possibilities of leaving his car, his body, his planet. And as the traffic signal changes again, Sergei opens his car door and steps out, jacketless, into the brisk night air. A swirling breeze curls his hair.', 'He stands in the center of the intersection of High St and McDowell and waves. He waves to the triumvirate of orange lights in the night sky, and he imagines someone or some thing waving back.', 'This has been traffic.', '###', 'More on our hike. I can’t stop thinking about it. My husband, Carlos, as you may not know, is a scientist. And he was truly in his element. He showed us all kinds of flora and fauna, telling us tons of interesting facts about everything we encountered. We saw lots of dragonflies, some as large as my hand. There were hawks galore. Just the most hawks. Think of all the hawks you’ve ever seen. Now double that, then add 9, then divide by 3. THAT is how many hawks we saw in just a single afternoon. The hawks circled above us, which caused the rabbits to hop and scamper in all directions.', 'Our little 3-year-old shouted “bunnies!” He tried to pet them, but Carlos cautioned him that while most mammals look like they want hugs, almost none of them do. Esteban was disappointed that he could not pick up the rabbits, especially when one of the hawks did that very thing. Carlos had to explain the circle of life to our inconsolable son, which went over better than expected, especially because we found a little creek with some toads for Esteban to play with.', 'I remember going to the woods as a young boy with my sister and my mother. We used to go about 3 or 4 times each year on a long hike. What I recall most vividly were the owls. Even in the bright of day, they were so loud. So very loud. I asked my mother why the owls were so noisy, and she never answered me. Once I even found a sleeping raccoon, and a coyote was hunched over it playfully gnawing at its open belly. You learn so much in the woods. I’ll never forget those times.', 'Last Saturday in the woods, I heard the owls again, their low hoots and growls, ever-present. I had forgotten their sound, but it all came back to me. I asked Carlos why the owls were always making that noise, but he didn’t seem to know why, or even understand what I was asking. It was a wonderful day.', 'Watching Esteban and Carlos sitting on moss-covered rocks and pointing at fish and salamanders, I thought of what it must be like to have a dad, and how I was so glad that unlike me, Esteban has a loving father.

He marked up the area with long chalk lines and built a fence at the far end. The corn fields are completely gone now. In their place is a baseball diamond. John said, “I was in my fields of invisible corn, and I heard this voice. The voice told me, ‘If you build it, he will stop by for a visit,’ And I knew it was the voice of my narrator.” John continued: “Like the ancient gods, I only exist because people talk about me, believe in me, and if the narrator of my life should ever discontinue his old yarn about old John, well, I’d cease to exist.

I built me a baseball diamond.”', 'John thought the voice was suggesting that by building a baseball diamond, the ghost of John’s father would come to the farm and play catch with John.

Yvette wanted Amelia's value to the world to be so great, that no one could deny her success.\\xa0\", \"Yvette recognized Amelia's specialness, and pushed hard to make her even more special, signing Amelia up for athletics and adult-learning classes and piano lessons.

It wasn\\'t because she understood her mother\\'s motivation to secure her child a better life. Nor was it because Amelia did not have the stomach to fight back. No, Amelia did it because it all came so easy. She was a black belt, a sharpshooter, an Academic Decathlon champion. She wrote her first novel at age 12. It was called \"A Golden Age for Parachuting,\" in which an all-Jewish female parachute team wins Olympic Gold in 1936 Berlin, in front of Adolph Hitler. In the publisher\\'s rejection letter, the editor said the novel was quote \"immaculately written, however parachuting stories are out of vogue. Do you have anything about Magical Baseball Players?\" Amelia did. It was a novel called \"One Last Swing for the Tuesday Boys,\" but she had written it in German and did not have time to translate the \"Dienstagsjungen\" (pronounce DEENS tocks Yoong en) manuscript because she was currently taking a course on bird husbandry.', \"Yvette enrolled the teenage Amelia in night classes at the community college, where she took English 113: Sonnets are for Lovers, Structural Engineering 212: 'Buttress' is a Funny Word, and Meteorology 301: Clouds, Y'all.

From birth, she heard the constant chatter of dozens of people. None of the voices spoke directly to Amelia, they just talked and talked about their lives. Amelia was afraid of the voices, and what the voices might imply about herself.', '###', 'She found solace in puzzles. Crosswords, Nonograms (pronounced NON uh grams), Acrostics, Cryptics, Sudoku, which I think is the one where you have to catch a bunch of marbles with a lever-operated hippopotamus.\\xa0', 'Her mother hated Amelia\\'s puzzle vice. If she caught Amelia doing puzzles, Yvette would make Amelia go practice archery, or write poetry, or at least listen to classical music.

It is to say the semantics of success were her own, and no one else's.\", 'Amelia became an air traffic controller.\\xa0', '###', 'The voices never told Amelia to become an air traffic controller. They were never that specific.\\xa0', \"The voices did not tell her to do anything. They simply talked, about first dates, about apartment hunting, about their grandmother's improved health, about a bad movie they sort of loved. None of the voices talked directly to her. It was simply as though she overheard conversations from lives lived somewhere else. Other people and their quotidien hopes and worries and interests.\\xa0\", 'She tried seeing therapists and psychiatrists. She tried medications to stop the voices, but nothing worked. Eventually she decided they were not harmful voices, and that she was not dealing with schizophrenia. She simply heard people talking, at all hours, about all things, having nothing to do with her. And they never told her to become an air traffic controller.\\xa0', 'Amelia chose her own career, her own path. Others thought the reason was that it was the first job opportunity to present itself, or maybe it was her admiration of aircraft. Maybe a moral sense of serving humanity through public safety and comfort.\\xa0', 'In fact it was none of those reasons, but it should not be surprising to know that Amelia was very good at air traffic control. She was calm, clear, and efficient.\\xa0', 'The Night Vale International Airport - although when Amelia started, it was just a commuter hub - has never had a high volume of plane traffic, and almost all of those are departures. There are very few arrivals.\\xa0', 'My husband Carlos - he\\'s a scientist and is also very good at his job - tells me that it\\'s impossible to have far more departures than arrivals.

In 2004, she was featured on the cover of Affirmative!, a monthly trade magazine for Air Traffic Controllers. The headline of the article was \"You\\'re Cleared for Success\". In 2006, she was asked to deliver the keynote speech at the annual RogerCon, a convention for air traffic controllers and fans of air traffic control. It\\'s a huge deal, held every year in Orlando. People dress up like their favorite airline pilots and wait in long lines for autographs from top flight attendants. There are even panel discussions about everything from the best textiles for seat cushions to secret first class meal offerings.\\xa0', 'Amelia was the best at what she did. She probably would have been the best poet laureate or senator, but this was the path she chose.\\xa0', \"She chose this path because of the voices. Not from what they said, but what they didn't say. When Amelia was in the control tower, when she was communicating with captains and co-pilots and navigators, her head was clear. All was silent. It was like those many nights, sneaking a copy of the crossword from the newspaper on the kitchenette and solving it by flashlight under her covers.\\xa0\", 'She became an air traffic controller to be by herself, to become her own person. Her mother was disappointed but loved her in spite of it. Her professors were let down but still had many fabulous stories of their greatest student. Her friends were just happy she was happy.', '###', 'Things changed on June 15, 2012, when Delta flight 18713 made radio contact.\\xa0', 'In her tall tower, at her tiny airport, in the middle of a vast desert, in the middle of the American Southwest, an airplane appeared on Amelia’s radar. It was carrying 143 passengers and 6 crew members, and was flying from Detroit to Albany, over the Great Lakes, in the American Northeast,\\xa0', 'It appeared briefly, the green dot blinking in and out of existence like the sun glinting off a water ripple. It was almost unnoticeable. But everyone noticed it. Later, Amelia was the only one who admitted to noticing it.\\xa0', 'The radio transmission was equally brief, a surge of static and only one word, difficult to discern, but she heard it.', '\"Alpha\" was the single word, the letter A in the NATO alphabet. It was garbled, so maybe it wasn\\'t that word. Maybe it was a more adult variation of \"Oh fudge.\" Alpha. Oh Fudge. It was unclear.', 'Amelia requested identification of the aircraft. She requested further communication, but nothing came. As soon as it had squawked, it had gone silent.\\xa0', '###', 'But while the radio communication was silent, the voices were not. On June 15, 2012, upon hearing a word that sounded like “Alpha” these myriad conversations returned. No one else in the tower could hear them, but Amelia Anna Alfaro could. And for the first time in her life, she began to speak back to them. Everyone else in the tower could hear that.\\xa0', 'The voices did not cease. The voices continued for days and days, and Amelia tried to talk back with them. As one voice said \"I have an interview on Monday,\" Amelia would ask \"For what job?\" or if a voice said \"We went to Palm Springs on vacation,\" Amelia would say \"Did you also travel out to the Salton Sea?\" But over and over, no response.\\xa0', \"The voices did not affect the quality of Amelia's work, but it affected the perceived quality of her work, and her colleagues became uncomfortable with and distrusting of Amelia.\\xa0\", 'A month later, Amelia heard that word again from one of the voices: \"Alpha.\" It was the same voice that radioed in June. But upon hearing it again, she realized that they didn\\'t say \"Alpha\" at all.', 'What they said, coming up. But first the Weather.', '###', 'WEATHER: “Skinchanger” by ', '###', 'The voice had said \"Alfaro.\" The word had been truncated just as the airplane\\'s appearance in Night Vale had been truncated. The voice saying the word was the captain of the aircraft, and he had been trying to tell Amelia something. The pilot was trying to tell Amelia that he knew her, had always known her, since her birth. He didn\\'t know how he knew her, just that he did, and he wanted to tell her he had found her, and she should find him.', '\"Where are you?\" Amelia asked the captain.\\xa0', '\"No Where\" the voice said.', '\"Did you land?\" Amelia asked.', '\"Yes,\" the voice said.', '\"Were there injuries?\" Amelia asked.', '\"Minor\" the voice said.\\xa0', '\"Do you hear the other voices, too?\" Amelia asked.', '\"Yes,\" the captain said. \"I\\'m with them right now. Find us, Amelia.\"', '\"Where are you?\" Amelia asked again, louder, more scared than before.\\xa0', '\"No Where,\" the voice said, not like the vague concept of \"in no place\" but No Where, two words, capitalized, like the name of a specific place.', 'Amelia felt a tap on her shoulder. It was another air traffic controller. \"Boss wants to see you, Amelia\" they said.\\xa0', 'But Amelia did not go see the boss. She knew. She knew her time in the tower was done.\\xa0', 'She grabbed her belongings and walked to the elevator, out across the tarmac, to a shuttle, to a parking lot, and into her car. And no one saw her again.\\xa0', 'Her friends said she always talked about going back to school to get an advanced degree. Maybe she went to Stanford or Rice or The University of What It Is. Other friends said she had lost all touch with reality, talking to people who were not there, and maybe her mother checked Amelia into the Night Vale Asylum.\\xa0', 'Yvette says Amelia knew too much, that agents from a vague yet menacing government agency had been to her house, and that Amelia must have been taken to a secret location.\\xa0', 'Representatives from the National Safety and Transportation Bureau in Washington, DC, came to Night Vale two months ago to investigate the disappearance of flight 18713.

There’s also the Black Box Theater, which presents some of Night Vale's most experimental drama from young performance artists. No one has seen any of these shows, or if they have, they've never emerged from that doorless Black Box, its walls perfectly smooth and faintly warm. But this particular play was at the Asylum itself.\\xa0\", 'The Night Vale Asylum perches atop a craggy peak in the sandwastes. Its Brutalist concrete walls intermittently slashed with slivers of windows.\\xa0', \"I do not personally know anyone inside this intimidating institute, other than Warden Rainier himself. And I'll admit to being a bit nervous venturing out at night to a heavily-guarded home for the criminally insane.\\xa0\", 'But Carlos put me at ease by rolling his eyes. He said it was neurotypical ableism that makes us think this way. That movies and TV shows often play up harmful tropes about psychopaths and lunatics planning daring escapes so that they can return to a life of criminal misdeeds. Carlos explained that asylums are merely places where we hide away the people who most remind us of the inexplicable fragility of the human brain.\\xa0', 'Driving out past the scrublands under an indigo sky, the full moon low over the horizon, backlighting the Night Vale Asylum atop its jagged, rocky ridge, my nerves returned. I thought I heard coyotes howling in the distance, but it was the car stereo. Carlos had put on his favorite new Frank Ocean album called \"Various Animals Screaming\"', '###', 'When we arrived, Warden Rainier greeted us at the gates. Two guards wearing Army-style green dress uniforms flanked him. Their right breasts were laden with medals, chevrons and stripes. They each were armed with billy clubs, tasers, and slingshots, and one of them was wearing an eye patch, but it was positioned in the middle of his forehead.\\xa0', 'The Warden escorted Carlos and me to our seats, which were simple wood chairs. There were only 10 seats total, all in a single row along the near wall. There was no standard stage to speak of, no curtain. The actors were all in costume in the center of the room, already in character.\\xa0', \"The other seats were already filled: Warden Rainier, Sheriff Sam, 3 of Sam's Secret Police officers, 2 of Sam's Overt Police Officers, and an angel I had never met before, but who introduced themself to me as Erika.\\xa0\", '\"With a \\'K.\\'\" they added.\\xa0', '\"Nice to meet you Erika,\" I said.\\xa0', '\"You got ten bucks?\" Erika asked.\\xa0', '\"Sure,\" I said. \"What for?\"', '\"Not everyone gets to know everything.\" they said. \"You either got it or you don\\'t, man.\"', \"So I handed them ten bucks, and minutes later, my lower back pain, which has plagued me for the past 6 months, was gone. I looked back at Erika and I saw them wink at me. Or I thought they winked. They have 10 eyes, so it could have just been an asynchronous blink. It's hard to even tell what they're ever looking at.\\xa0\", 'The play began with an introduction by Warden Rainier, who welcomed us all to this unusual night. The first ever performance of an original play by inmates in his asylum. He introduced the writers-slash-directors of the piece.\\xa0', 'There were three of them, each dressed in an electric blue jumpsuit. One of them had a blister on his upper lip. Another, a swollen red lump along the cuticle of his right index finger. One of them had an unceasing nose bleed. I recognized them as the agents from the National Safety and Transportation Bureau in Washington, who had come to Night Vale two months ago to investigate the disappearance of Delta Flight 18713.\\xa0', 'Sheriff Sam had placed these agents undercover in the Asylum to try to meet with an inmate named Doug Biondi, who claimed to have pertinent information about the missing aircraft.\\xa0', 'Upon remembering this, I flipped quickly through my Playbill to find the ensemble members\\' names. And there on the title page was the name Doug Biondi, who was cast as \"Airplane Pilot\"', 'As the Warden returned to his seat, and before the houselights dimmed,\\xa0 I leaned over to Sheriff Sam and asked \"How is the undercover operation going, Sheriff?\"', 'Sam glared at me and said \"I\\'ve no idea what you mean.\"', '\"You know, with the NTSB officers? Here in the asylum? Trying to interview Doug Biondi?\" I asked, perhaps a little loudly for a theater.\\xa0', '\"The NTSB officers are criminally insane, Cecil.\" the Sheriff said, unironically and with more than a touch of scold in their tone. \"That is why they are here. They are a danger to themselves and others.\"', 'I had many more questions, but before I could say anything, the lights faded to black, and I heard the first voice of the play.\\xa0', '###', '\"Find us,\" called the voice in the dark. \"Find us,\" it echoed again.\\xa0', 'A faint glow coated like frost the wild-eyed faces of the inmates on stage, their frantic visages made all the more manic by deep eyeliner, rouge and lipstick. Most were dressed in common street clothes: slacks, jeans, button down shirts, mid-length patterned skirts. Two were dressed as flight attendants, and one as the pilot.\\xa0', 'I can only presume a small budget, as the uniforms worn by the latter groups were largely suggested by navy-blue hats and little plastic wings on their lapels.\\xa0', 'The pilot wore anachronistic aviation goggles, and so it was difficult for me to see and remember the face of this actor, this inmate Doug Biondi, but I could see his mouth, which was unusually wide, the corners of his lips extending well past the width of his eyes. He had an unusual number of teeth in his harsh smile, a smile which never abated even in his most somber of scenes.\\xa0', '\"We survive,\" said Biondi\\'s pilot character, \"We live. We cannot die. Not here. Not in No Where.\"', 'He said it not like the vague concept of \"in no place\" but No Where, two words, capitalized, like the name of a specific place.', 'Each actor was seated in short, tight rows of 4, a narrow aisle in between, mimicking the floorplan of a common fuselage. At the front of the troupe sat Doug Biondi as Airline Pilot.\\xa0', '\"How did we get here. In No Where,\" said one of the passengers.', '\"And how shall we return\" said another.', '\"Only,\" they said in unison. \"When you find us.\"', 'This last line they said with a quick twist of their necks toward the audience.\\xa0', 'Then the scene shifted, the chairs cleared and all of the actors stood in the profile of a Greek Chorus.\\xa0', 'They explained the flight from Detroit, the view of Lake Erie. They told stories of different passengers. One who had a job interview. One who was looking for an apartment. Another who went to Palm Springs on vacation. They told the story of a bright light and a loud pop.', 'And suddenly the engines were silent. The plane felt still, unmoving. And then the chorus all pantomimed the leaning concerned gaze out airplane windows. Instead of tops of clouds or distant shapes of Great Lakes, though, they looked out and saw... children. In a gymnasium. They heard the squeak of sneakers and the joyful cries of playful exercise.\\xa0', 'It felt like minutes, maybe a whole hour. They could not understand what they were seeing. They could not comprehend an elementary school gym six miles above Southern Canada. But they were not six miles above Southern Canada, they were only a few feet above the American Southwest, inside an airplane, inside an elementary school gymnasium, in a town called Night Vale.\\xa0', 'And as quickly as they had appeared there, they disappeared. Off the radar, gone from the skies, out of known existence.\\xa0', 'Throughout this chorus, the speakers filled our ears with the joyful shouts of children, the hollow metallic thumps of red rubber balls, and the collective panicked inhale of 143 passengers and crew of a displaced plane. And then it was silent. And then it was dark.\\xa0', 'A single green light appeared on the far wall, a dot, a blip, a radar blinking on, then off. And the voice of Doug Biondi said \"We are not passengers on a plane. We are actors. We are inmates of the Asylum of Night Vale. But we do not belong here. We are people who know Truths. People who know more than is allowed. And for that we are kept in cages. We are fed poisoned pills and circular logic.\"', 'And at this point in the play, I felt movement in our small audience. The Warden had stood up, and was shouting \"This is not in the script, Doug.\"', 'But Doug spoke louder, faster: \"I am not insane I say. Only the insane would say such a thing they say. Then I am insane I say. Yes you are they say. I am trapped. I am framed. I spit out your poisoned pills. I reject your propagandist blather. I know what I know I say. Hold him down they say.\"', 'Warden Rainier had gone to the tech board and turned on all the lights. He shouted \"Code Blue\" into a radio receiver, and we saw half a dozen security officers in their green, medal-laden uniforms lurch from the corners of the room, penning the ensemble of inmates into a tight circle in the center.\\xa0', '\"Return them to their rooms,\" the Warden called.\\xa0', 'But as the guards encroached. the three men from the NTSB stepped to the perimeter of the mass of inmates. They were holding little plastic wings, just like those on the costumes of the actors playing flight attendants.\\xa0', 'One of the NTSB agents - the one with an unceasing nose bleed - opened the back of the wings, revealing a long sharp pin and thrust it into the neck of a guard. Simultaneously the other NTSB agents and several actors did the same. And the guards fell to the ground.\\xa0', 'One of the NTSB agents - the one with a blister on his upper lip - grabbed the keys and weapons from an unconscious officer.\\xa0', '\"Dearest audience,\" he said in verse, \"We mean them no harm.\\xa0', \"'Tis but a sleep, a little pharm-\", 'aceutical rest for a uniformed guard', 'Who kept us confined, made life hard', 'For us low level agents doing our jobs,', 'Trapped ‘neath the lies of a Warden who robs', 'Our freedom, and murders our spirit.', 'At last we can go, approach the wall and clear it', 'But heed my warning, as we this coop fly:', 'Every man for himself, better run...\\xa0 or die.\"', 'And upon this last line, the alarm bells of the asylum rattled my ears and my nerves, shaking Carlos and me from our seats. The inmates scattered in every direction, as Sheriff Sam and their officers gave chase. Carlos was nearly stepped on by one of the escapees, and as I bent to help him up, I was knocked over by two officers in full sprint.\\xa0', 'When the commotion died down, I looked up and saw Erika, still sitting calmly in their chair, and I asked \"Erika, what is happening?\"', 'Erika looked down at their Playbill and then back at me and said \"I think it\\'s intermission.\"', 'And now, the weather.', '###', 'WEATHER: “One One Thousand” by ', '###', \"After 15 minutes, Carlos and I returned to our seats, hoping, but not truly believing it really was an intermission. We've seen immersive theater before. Like Sleep No More, an interactive show in New York City where audience members are placed inside a huge warehouse of actors dancing out the plot to Macbeth, and at the end, everyone is granted the ability to live out the rest of their lives without sleep. It's expensive, and not for everyone, but totally worth it if immersive theater is your thing.\", 'But this show was not that. No, \"18713/NTSB\" had gone wrong. Or perhaps it had gone right? Under the strict critique of plot structure, character development, and production value, the play failed terribly, but as a piece of political, or agitprop, theater is was a rousing success.\\xa0', \"The Sheriff's Secret Police have placed roadblocks around the entire city, hoping to keep these supposedly dangerous inmates from leaving the area. It is bad optics, to say the least, for the entire population of the town's asylum to escape custody.\\xa0\", 'But as Carlos and I left the theater space, we walked down the long corridors, cells and rooms open, no security detail in sight. In one of the cells, below a cot, was a journal. It was the journal of Doug Biondi. Page after page was filled with monologues, narratives and conversations from various people. People who were on a plane. People in transit between checkpoints of life, between relationships, between homes, between jobs, between vacation and work. These stories were written as verbatim dialogue, as if Doug Biondi had transcribed them himself. As if he could hear the voices of those very people.\\xa0', 'Like former air traffic controller Amelia Anna Alfaro. I wonder if Doug heard the same voices. The same passengers of the missing plane. I had my intern Seamus (SHAY-muss) go down to the library and look up public records on Doug Biondi hoping to find some connection between Doug and Amelia. But Seamus still has yet to return with that information.', \"I even doublechecked my Playbill looking for Amelia's name in the cast or crew, but she was not listed there. She was likely never in the asylum.\", 'One thing I did find, though, was a note in the back of Doug\\'s Journal. This note seemed to be in Doug\\'s own voice: \"They tell us we are kept here for our safety. But they keep us here for their safety. They fear what will happen when the people on that plane are found, but I think they have already been found. They should be afraid of what happens when the people on the plane find us.\"', 'Night Vale is on lock down, so stay home, and stay safe, listeners. I do not believe any of us to be in danger from those who escaped the asylum, but I do believe us to be in danger of most everything else.\\xa0', 'Stay tuned next for a series of audio clicks, which is definitely not federal agents tapping your radio. Don’t worry about it.', 'Good night, Night Vale. Good night.', '###', 'PROVERB: What if -- and hear me out -- what if someone made a printer that worked every time you needed it to work?']\n",

The fiery fall leaves, pristine winter snowfall, lush spring flowers, and sparkling summer lakes belied the average life of young Charles.\\xa0', 'He went to school, passed his classes. He spent time with friends seeing popular movies and playing popular games. His family ate food together and generally got along. When he wanted to be alone, he went to a small pond, hidden in the woods, to fish. He studied sociology at Amherst College and graduated in the top 50 percent of his class.\\xa0', 'Nothing about his unremarkable upbringing indicated he would one day be standing in the middle of a desert, behind a roadblock, holding a rifle and a flashlight, and searching for fugitives from his own Asylum.\\xa0\\xa0', '###', 'Last month, a dozen inmates of the Night Vale Asylum escaped, during a production of a play. As an attendee of that play, I would say that while the escape was clearly not part of the original draft of the script, it made for an exciting resolution.\\xa0', 'I mean about 30 minutes in, Carlos and I were like \"Is there gonna be a car chase or a shootout or something? I mean that play was borrr-rrring.\" And then suddenly there was both!\\xa0', \"But the Warden, Charles Rainier from Becket, Massachusetts, did not like the last minute edits to the plot, as he and the Sheriff's Secret Police have yet to round up any of the inmates now on the run, somewhere in our vast desert.\\xa0\", 'Night Vale citizens have expressed deep concerns about their safety. A scathing Op-Ed in yesterday\\'s Daily Journal by Leann Hart read: \"Warden Rainier should never have been in charge of such an important institution. His unchecked irresponsibility will lead us all to be killed by psychopaths who surely hide now inside our basements, our attics,\\xa0 our laundry hampers, perhaps inside our own pants pockets!\"', 'The editorial continued: \"They wield knives, ropes, wrenches, candlesticks, or pipes. And when we least expect it, these crazed killers will leap out at us screaming about eating our faces, or feeding us to rodents, or whatever other evil actions those two very funny women are always describing on My Favorite Murder.\"', \"Charles Rainier called Hart's claims neurotypical ableism, saying that we've become too biased from movies and TV shows that play up harmful tropes about mental illnesses. He added that none of the people inside were of immediate danger to any individual in Night Vale.\\xa0\", 'The Night Vale chapter of the ACLU then responded, calling for an investigation into a public facility that would imprison people who had committed no criminal acts and were of no harm to society.', 'Charles Rainier replied: \"I said they wouldn\\'t hurt any individual. I didn\\'t say they were of no harm to society.\"', '###', 'But who were the people in the Asylum? Carlos and I attended the production of the play \"18713/NTSB\" partially to have a nice date night, just the two of us, but also because I was curious if I would see Amelia Anna Alfaro there. The air traffic controller has not been seen since 2012, after hearing voices from the missing flight: Delta 18713. There were rumors she was checked into the Asylum, other rumors that she had gone off to find the missing plane, and other other rumors that she was \"disappeared\" by a vague yet menacing government agency.\\xa0', 'Amelia was not inside the Asylum the night of the breakout. But Doug Biondi was there. He played the Pilot of the missing plane in the play we saw. Doug was the impetus for this entire story, really, because it was Doug who - according to Sheriff Sam - had real information about the missing plane.\\xa0', 'Members of the National Transportation and Safety Board had also come to Night Vale to talk to Doug about what he knew. And Sheriff Sam obliged by sending those agents from Washington DC on an undercover investigation into the Asylum. Yet, like Doug, and the dozens of other inmates in that fearful place, they did not return.\\xa0', \"According to Doug Biondi's journal, which Carlos and I found inside the Asylum after the play, Warden Charles Rainier developed a paradoxical logic for dealing with his inmates. He encouraged them to talk openly about their feelings under the guise of healing them, but the more they expressed their thoughts and emotions, the more the Warden used this information as proof of their insanity, and by extension, ineligibility for release\", \"But, as Doug elaborates, if inmates refused to talk, they were deemed uncooperative and, of course, ineligible for release. Reading further into Doug's journal, I realized it's just like that novel, Catch-22, in that there's a bunch of talk about airplanes.\", 'What stood out most to me , though, was the fact that every other inmate Doug mentions also talked about the missing Delta flight. Every single person in there either heard voices of the passengers or had theories about what happened, or were, in the case of the NTSB agents, just hoping to find survivors of a missing plane.\\xa0', 'Doug railed against the collusion between the Warden and the Sheriff to imprison people simply because they knew something - anything - about flight 18713. This is the last thing Doug wrote, the day he escaped: \"This nefarious conspiracy runs deep. Deeper than we can imagine. There are innocent people on a missing plane, and our government wants to destroy us for seeking the truth. Oh well, in other news, they fixed the TV in the rec room, so I\\'m hoping to finally watch CHEER on Netflix. Everyone says it\\'s super good.\"', 'Doug makes a compelling claim here, but he is wrong.\\xa0', 'About the conspiracy thing, not about CHEER. That show is super good.', '###', \"So, back in 2015, my devoted husband, and devoted scientist, Carlos, was heading a research project into a desert otherworld, a place very similar to our own. We spent almost a year apart while Carlos was in this alternate dimension performing experiments and drawing charts and pouring bubbling liquids back and forth between flasks. It was hard. We had only been dating a year when he left. But we kept in touch, talking almost every day, sending each other text messages at night. Like a kissy-face emoji with a big red heart emoji. Or sometimes we sent racier messages like the safety googles emoji with the police siren emoji and the first place ribbon emoji. (Sorry if that's a little too graphic.)\", 'Anyway, Carlos made friends during his many months out of town, and so when he finally decided to return to Night Vale, some of those he met followed him. They came through a portal Carlos discovered in the desert otherworld - a one sided door. It was difficult to find in a never-ending sandscape, but it is still there, and as Carlos said, once you know the way, you never forget it.\\xa0', 'One of the people who came with Carlos through that portal in 2015 was Charles Rainier of Becket, Massachusetts. It was not easy for most of these new arrivals to find comfort or employment in Night Vale, but in just a few months, Charles had become friends with our new Sheriff and secured himself a job at the Night Vale Asylum.\\xa0', \"Few people looked deeply at the Asylum, nor at Charles Rainier's quick appointment as Warden. Few people, in fact, look closely at anything to do with mental disorders. It is almost as if we prefer not to see mental illness at all. It is almost exactly like that.\\xa0\", 'Well below the radar of public attention, Charles settled into his new position. And because there are no accounts of what went on in the Asylum, and thus no stories of failure, it was inferred that he did a good job.\\xa0', '###', \"But Carlos discovered something this week. In reading Doug Biondi's journal, Doug makes passing mention of Warden Rainier cautioning his inmates against listening to the voice of the Pilot. The Warden warns them that the Pilot can control other beings with his mind.\\xa0\", \"It is odd that the head of a mental health institution would patronize his patients with their own inner demons. Carlos at first thought the Warden was manipulating the mental stability of his charges, to stir up their fear and confusion in order to keep them there. We didn't know if the Warden profited from retaining inmates, or if he just felt an evil thrill from playing these games.\\xa0\", 'But in Doug\\'s notes, the Warden apparently said: \"It is possible to escape the allure of the Pilot, the power of his voice. Some have, but it is rare, and it is dangerous that you can hear him at all.\"', \"Carlos remembered when he first met Charles Rainier, 5 years ago in the desert otherworld. Charles was so enthralled with Carlos's stories of Night Vale. Charles Rainier could not wait to see this fantastic town, and more importantly, to leave the terrible place in which he lived. He told Carlos that he escaped some frightening people there.\", \"Charles Rainier said he had lived in a commune for a couple of years. It began okay. They foraged and hunted their food. They helped each other and shared shelter inside the fuselage of an old plane. Everything was fine. They were alive, but soon the group became cult-like and aggressive, fashioning weapons and manufacturing enemies. The constant threat of violence toward others, toward themselves, shackled Charles's every move. But he could not leave. Every time he tried, he heard a voice that called him back.\\xa0\", 'So he trained himself to block out the voices. It took him weeks of determined practice, but finally, he broke free.\\xa0', 'Carlos said to me: \"Cecil, sweetie, my hypothesis is Charles Rainier was flying home from Detroit to Albany on June 15, 2012.\\xa0', 'And I said: \"What are you saying, honeypup?\"', 'And Carlos said: \"Babe, his plane blipped out of the sky and into the desert otherworld.\"', 'And I said: \"Are you saying, Kittycake, that Charles was a passenger on Delta 18713?\"', 'But then Carlos said: \"You know, little piggy pie, all this work-talk is exhausting.

He was, indeed, a passenger on 18713. They landed roughly but safely in the desert otherworld in June 2012. They ate their few food items and drank their water stores within two days, and soon they began spreading out to find civilization.\\xa0', 'But the desert was vast and seemingly uninhabited. They were too afraid to venture far from the plane, the only symbol of recognizable society. The Pilot led expeditions to find plant life and sources of water. He exuded calmness and clarity, and the passengers followed his example, occasionally finding peace in this unpleasant and frightening desert.\\xa0', 'Within a couple of months, they had developed a rhythm. They were finding food to eat, water to drink. The Pilot seemed to know exactly where to hunt, exactly what to say, exactly how to behave. Every passenger fell in line. They all had jobs to do, roles to fill in this little commune. The fuselage kept them sheltered from the searing white days and the icy black nights. Sometimes they sang together, walked together, taught each other how to sew, how to cook, how to make tools.\\xa0', \"The passengers' fear became camaraderie, which became unity, which became family, which eventually became religiosity. One day they were making salves from cacti, and the next they were crafting weapons.\\xa0\", \"Charles hadn't realized it at first, but every person on that plane could communicate telepathically. They could speak without talking, know without learning. They were becoming a single organism, separated into dozens of bodies. The loudest voice in their heads was The Pilot. They had grown too complacent, and the Pilot began to fill them once again with fear: fear of outsiders, of the rest of the world. And they began to make barbaric expeditions, hoping to find people or things to destroy.\\xa0\", '\"I tried to escape,\" Charles said to me. \"I tried to escape over and over, but the voice was too strong. It was only when I thought about a little fishing hole down near Stockbridge that I would go to in summers, by myself, to get away, to be alone.\"', \"Charles said he began to pantomime fishing, casting his imaginary lure on an imaginary line into an imaginary pond on hot desert sand. And when he did this, the voices quieted in his mind. He could free himself from The Pilot's voice, from the Pilot's control.\\xa0\", 'I asked Charles why he and Sheriff Sam were locking away people just for knowing about the plane. He said, \"Cecil, I locked up Doug Biondi before anyone else. He\\'s from that otherworld, and he knows how to get back. And if he knows how to get back, he\\'ll join the 18713 and lead them into Night Vale.\"', 'Charles said he was protecting our little town from the threat of the passengers of Delta flight 18713. \"If the Pilot enlists Doug, and gets into Night Vale, he\\'ll recruit who he can and destroy the rest.\"', 'But why does he communicate only with Doug? Why not Carlos, or Dana Cardinal, or Sheriff Sam themself? Why not recruit everyone who knows the way into Night Vale?', '\"I don\\'t know, Cecil,\" Charles snapped back. \"But I don\\'t will it into existence by yapping about it, either.

It seems that Leanne Hart had cleaned up the trash from Mission Grove Park by merely shoving it to a nearby vacant lot and lighting it aflame. There had been so much trash and the fire had grown so large, that ash had started to drift over the surrounding area, and it was this which we all had mistaken for snow. It was only then that we noticed how much we were coughing, how much our eyes stung from the smoke, how what was falling from the sky did not resemble in any way except shape and color our understanding of snow.\\xa0', 'Without speaking, we started to drift away, a little bit embarrassed and a lot bit disappointed.

He screamed in fear of what the old man was about to do. He also screamed in joyous anticipation, and the two screams were discordant, like adjacent keys pressed simultaneously on a church organ.', 'The old whittler pressed his knife against Harrison’s chin and began to pull the blade back, using the force of his thumb and the trunk of his forefinger. He repeated throughout Harrison’s assenting and defiant shouts, and after a few moments, Harrison stopped yelling and stood, his jaw squarer, his nose thinner and longer, his shoulders broader. And Harrison smiled.\\xa0', 'Soon, the whittler began carving houses, roads, and city buildings. They were larger than the koala, much larger, for they were full-sized renditions of these things. He sliced and sawed away at block after block of red oak, hackberry, and beech wood, forming new arteries of city travel, whole blocks of residences, and even cultural landmarks and venues. And the town of Night Vale, in a single late morning began to expand into the distant and uninhabitable scrublands of our desert.', '###', 'Let’s have a look now at horoscopes.', 'GEMINI: Bury yourself in your work today, Gemini.

It’s everything we ever wanted.”', 'The dissenting voices, and they were few, could only argue that he failed to acquire proper permits for any of this construction, let alone an outdoor vendor’s license, which is mandatory even for giveaways, excepting restaurant samples, marketing promotions, and military dispersion of chemtrails.', 'The many-voiced, uni-bodied creature that is the City Council huffed in nearly unanimous support for this old man, his sad whistling, his prolific whittling, and his beneficence to our city.', '“Did you see,” said three of the voices, “that inside the General Store there’s everything you could ever need: cans, boxes, shelves, counters, walls.

My happiness cannot be improved.', 'Or so I believed.', 'When I arrived, the whittler, more than a hundred feet away and through a mass of thousands, greeted me with a nod so unobtrusive, I believed it to be a trick of the eye. But from the distance, I could see the whole of the universe in those dark eyes under dark shadow behind the final violet of sunset. I knew he meant me.', 'Carlos and I stepped to the podium, and the old man opened his palm to reveal an original carving, just for me. I had hoped it was a Nintendo Switch, but it was a seaplane.', 'Carlos, like a child on Santa’s lap, cooed and asked the old man for a super conducting super collider, and the old whittler, his burlap cheeks heavy with gravity and history, reached into the breast pocket of his pearlsnap shirt and handed Carlos a tiny wooden rose.', 'Carlos hugged his rose to his chest, and I my seaplane. The whittler took the hand again of his bride and gazed upon her. Her veiled eyes met by his boundless stare. They stood like that for more than an hour, not speaking.

Then his bride, then the seats beneath us. It all gave way to crumbling nothing. Then the buildings and roads and even the General Store turned into ash. Finally, every one of our objects, dissipated like Euridice almost free from Hades. A gentle cool breeze arrived to sweep our hope away.', 'We returned home, wordless, with occasional whistles of the whittler’s tune, once again in a sad and lonesome key.

      "['Quoth the Raven: [short clip of actual raven caws] Welcome to Night Vale', 'Listeners, some exciting news from the world of theater. The Hundred Year play is about to reach its final scene. Yes, this is the play that has been running continuously since 1920, written by brilliant playwright Hannah Herschman, designed to take exactly one hundred years to perform. And the tireless volunteers of the Night Vale Players Playhouse have been going through those scenes, one after another, for decade upon decade. There is little time to rehearse, for each hour brings new scenes, and each scene will only be performed once before the play moves on, in order to keep up with the tight schedule needed to execute the entire script before a century elapses.\\xa0', 'It is a monumental work of theater, but like all work, it must someday cease. Today specifically. I will be in attendance at that historic moment, when the final scene is performed, and the curtain closes on the Hundred Year Play.', '\\xa0', 'More soon, but first, the news.', 'We bring you the latest on the lawsuit: The Estate of Franklin Chen vs the City of Night Vale. As you know, this case has grown so large and complicated that I have not had time to discuss it during my usual community radio broadcasts, and instead have started a true crime podcast called Bloody Laws/Bloody Claws: The Murder of Frank Chen, in which I strive to get to the truth of just what happened on that fateful night when five headed dragon Hiram McDaniels met Frank Chen, and then later Frank Chen’s body was found covered in burns and claw marks. It’s a confounding mystery. The Sheriff’s Secret Police announced that it seems really complicated, and they’re not even gonna try to solve that sucker.', '“Oh what?” a Secret Police spokesman muttered at an earthworm he found in his garden. “You want us to fail? You want to see us fail? That’s why you want us to investigate this case? To see us fail at it?”\\xa0', 'The family of Frank Chen say they merely want the appropriate parties (in this case the city of Night Vale, Hiram McDaniels, and an omniscient conception of God) to take responsibility for their part in this tragedy.', 'The trial is now in its 10th month, and has included spirited reenactments of the supposed murder by helpful Players Playhouse performers in between their work on the Hundred Year Play, three changes of judge and venue due to, quote “some dragon attacks”, and constant interruptions from a local audio journalist who hosts a widely respected true crime podcast.', 'Still, with all this, we near a verdict. Judge Chaplin has indicated she will issue her ruling soon. “Like in the next year or so,” she said. “Certainly, within five years. Listen, I don’t owe you a verdict. Just because you’re paying me to do a job, you can’t rush me to do it. The verdict will be done when it’s done.”', 'Chaplin then huffed out the courtroom, followed by journalists shouting recommendations for episodes of their podcast to listen to.', 'I was present, you know, on opening night of the Hundred Year Play. Oh, how the theater buzzed. Of course, this was partly the audience, thrilled to be at the start of such an unprecedented work. But mostly it was the insects. The Night Vale Players Playhouse had quite a pest problem at the time. And still does. It’s difficult to do pest control when there is a hundred year long play being performed on stage at every hour of every day.\\xa0', 'The curtain opened, those many years ago, on a simple set of a studio apartment. A kitchen, a cot, a window overlooking a brick wall. A man sits in the corner, deep in thought. A doorbell rings. “Come in, it’s open,” the man calls. A woman enters, flustered. She is holding a newborn.\\xa0', '“There’s been a murder,” she says. “The victim was alone in a room and all the doors and windows were locked.”', '“My god,” the man says and springs up. “Who could have done this? And how?”', 'The woman tells him: “It turns out it was the gardener, Mr. Sprechel. He served with the victim in the war, and never could forgive him for what happened there. He threw a venomous snake through an airvent.”', 'The man sits back down nodding. “Ah. So the mystery is solved.”', 'As a playwright, Hannah Herschman did not believe in stringing out mysteries a second longer than was necessary.\\xa0', 'The baby in the woman’s arm stirs.', '“Shhh, little one,” the woman says.\\xa0', 'The man looks out the window, where he cannot see the sky. “It might look like rain,” he says. “Who knows?”', 'Thus began a journey of a hundred years.\\xa0', 'And now for a word from our sponsors.', 'Today’s episode is sponsored by the Night Vale medical board, which would like to remind you that it is important to drink enough water throughout the day.', 'Drink more water. Your body can’t function without water. Without water you are just dust made animate. Water forms the squelching mud of sentience.', 'Try to have at least ten big glasses of water. Not over the entire day. Right now. See if you can get all ten of them down. Explore the capacity of your stomach. See if you can make it burst. You will either feel so much better, or an organ will explode and you will die painfully, and either one is more interesting than the mundane now.', 'You should drink even more water than that. Wander out of your door, search the earth for liquids. Find a lake and drain the entire thing, until the bottom feeders flop helpless on the flatlands. Laugh sloshingly as you look upon the destruction you have wrought. The power that you possess now that you are well-hydrated.', 'Move on from the lake and come to the shore of an ocean. All oceans are one ocean that we have arbitrarily categorized by language. The sea knows no separation. And neither will you when you lay belly down on the sand, put your lips against the waves, and guzzle the ocean. The ocean is salty, it will not be very hydrating, so you’ll need to drink a lot of it. Keep going until the tower tops of Atlantis see sky again for the first time in centuries, until the strange glowing creatures of the deep deep are\\xa0 exposed, splayed out from their bodies now that they no longer have the immense pressure of the ocean depths to keep their structure intact.', 'And once you have drunk the oceans, turn your eyes to the stars. For there is water out there too, and you must suck dry the universe.', 'This has been a message from the Night Vale Medical Board.', 'Twenty years passed without me thinking about the Hundred Year Play. You know how it is. One day you’re an intern at the local radio station, doing all the normal errands like getting coffee and painting pentacles upon station management doors as part of the Ritual of the Slumbering Ancients. Then twenty years passes and everything is different for you. Your boss is gone and now ', 'are the host of the community radio station. And there are so many new responsibilities, and worries, and lucid nightmares in which you explore a broken landscape of colossal ruins', 'So with all of that, I just kind of forgot the Hundred Year Play was happening. But they were toiling away in there, doing scenes around the clock, building and tearing down sets at a frantic pace, trying to keep up with the script that relentlessly went on, page after page. Sometimes one of the people working on the play would wonder, “how does this all end?” but before they could flip ahead to look, there would be another scene that had to be performed and they wouldn’t have a chance. So no one knew how it ended, no one except Hannah Herschman, the mysterious author of this centennial play.', 'Soon after becoming radio host, during the reading of a community calendar, I was reminded that the play was still going on, and so decided to check in. I put on my best tux (it’s the one with scales and a confetti cannon), and took myself to a night at the theater.', 'I can’t say what happened in the plot since that first scene, but certainly much had transpired. We were now in a space colony, thousands of years from now. The set was simple, just some sleek chairs, and a black backdrop dotted with white stars of paint. A woman was giving a monologue about the distance she felt between the planet she was born on, which I believe was supposed to be Earth, and the planet she now stood on. I understood from what she was saying that the trip she had taken to this planet was one way, and that she would never return to the place she was born. “We are all of us moved by time,” she whispered, in a cracked, hoarse voice. “Not one of us dies in the world we were born into.”', 'Sitting in my seat, in that darkened theater, I knew two facts with certainty.\\xa0', 'The first was that this woman had been giving a monologue for several days now. She wavered on her feet, speaking for the entire four hours that I was there. I don’t know how much longer she spoke after I left, but it could have been weeks. She was pale and her voice was barely audible, but there was something transfixing about it, and the audience sat in perfect silence, leaning forward to hear her words.', 'The other fact I understood was this woman was the newborn from the very first scene. Not just the same character, but the same actor. Twenty years later, she was still on that stage, still portraying the life of the child we had been introduced to in the opening lines. She was an extraordinary performer, presumably having had a literal lifetime of practice.', 'And that was the last time I saw the play, until tonight, when I will go to watch the final scene.', 'But first, let’s have a look at that community calendar', 'Tonight the School Board is meeting to discuss the issue of school lunches. It seems that some in power argue that it isn’t enough that for some reason we charge the kids actual money for these lunches. They argue that the students should also be required to give devotion and worship to a great glowing cloud, whose benevolent power will fill their lives with purpose. Due to new privacy rules, we cannot say which member of the school board made this suggestion. The board will be taking public comment in a small flimsy wooden booth out by the highway. Just enter the damp, dark interior and whisper your comment, and it will be heard. Perhaps not by the school board, but certainly by something.\\xa0', 'Tuesday morning Lee Marvin will be offering free acting classes at the Rec Center. The classes, entitled “Acting Is Just Lying” will teach you how acting is just saying things that aren’t true, with emotions you don’t feel, so that you may fool those watching with these mistruths. Fortunately, Marvin commented, most people don’t want to be told the truth, and prefer the quiet comfort of a lie well told. Classes are pay what you want, starting at $10,000.\\xa0', 'Thursday Josh Crayton will be taking the form of a waterfall in Grove Park so that neighborhood kids may swim in him. There is not a lot of swimming opportunities in a town as dry as Night Vale, and so this is a generous move on Josh’s part. He has promised that he has been working on the form, and has added a water slide and a sunbathing deck. He asks that everyone swim safely and please not leave any trash on him.\\xa0', 'Friday the Corn Field will appear in the middle of town, right where it does each September as the air turns cooler and the sky in the west takes on a certain shade of green. The Corn Field emanates a power, electric and awful. Please do not go into the Corn Field, as we don’t know what lives in there or what it wants. The City Council would like to remind you that the Corn Field is perfectly safe. It is perfect And it is safe.\\xa0', 'Finally, Saturday never happened. Not if you know what’s good for you. Got it?', 'This has been the community calendar.', 'Oh, look at the time. Here I am blathering on, and the play is about to end. Ok, let me grab my new mini-recorder that Carlos got me for my birthday (it’s only 35 pounds and the antenna is a highly reasonable seven feet), and I’ll see you all there.\\xa0', 'What’s the weather like for my commute?', '[weather: “Shallow Eyes” by Brad Bensko https://www.bradbenskomusic.com/]', 'Carlos and I are at the theater. The audience is abuzz. With excitement yes, but also many of them are the insects that infest this theater. The bugs became entranced by the story over the years, passing down through brief generation after brief generation a history of all that happened before. The story of the play became something of a religion to this creepy crawly civilization, and so now the bugs are jittering on the walls, thrilled to be the generation that gets to see the end of this great tale.', 'The curtain rises on a scene I recognize well. It is a simple set of a studio apartment. A kitchen, a cot, a window overlooking a brick wall. A man sits in the corner, deep in thought. A doorbell rings. “Come in, it’s open,” the man calls.', 'A woman enters. She is very old, tottering unsteadily on legs that have carried her for many many years.', '“Please, take my seat,” the man says with genuine concern.', '“Thank you,” she says, collapsing with relief onto the cushions, and then looking out, as if for the first time noticing the audience. I know this woman. I first saw her as a baby, and later as a twenty year old. It seems she has lived her whole life on this stage, taking part in this play.', '“My name,” the woman says, “is Hannah Hirschfield. I was born in this theater, clutching a script in my arms that was bigger than I was. My twin, in a way. I started acting in that script of mine before I was even aware of the world. I grew up in that script. Lived my entire life in the play I had written, from infancy to now.”', 'She rises, and the man reaches out to help, but she waves him away. She speaks, her voice strong, ringing out through the theater', '“The play ends with my death, because the play is my life. It is bounded by the same hours and minutes that I am.”', 'The audience is rapt. Many have tears in their eyes. Even the insects weep.', '“Thank you for these hundred years,” Hannah Hirschfield says. “This script is complete.” She walks to the window. “It might look like rain,” she says. “Who knows?” The lights dim.\\xa0', 'Thunderous applause. Cries of acclaim.

He asked the obelisk if he was, quote, “gonna have corn for dinner.” The obelisk apparently said no, because little Bart started crying and the obelisk quickly disappeared, not to return for almost 10 years.', 'By that time, the Committee of the Obelisk was established and they chose the question: “How do you cure cancer?” This is a good and noble question, but the citizen chosen by the obelisk was a farmer named Barry McKenny who tried his best to take careful notes, but a lot of the detailed medical jargon was too complex for him.', 'The committee tried this question again 6 years later, but the obelisk refused to respond to any question it had already answered, so Sidney Lanyard of Old Town Night Vale, not having a back-up question from the committee, asked if his wife Jessica was cheating on him with Gerald Framingham. The obelisk said no, but it only said that because Gerald’s actual last name was FramingTON. Sidney just messed up.', 'Over the decades, the Committee of the Obelisk asked “Is God real?” and the obelisk said yes, but nothing more. After this, they tried to ask questions that would elicit more detailed responses. One year they asked “Who planned the assassination of JFK” and were disappointed to learn that it was a CIA-Fidel Castro-Frank Sinatra triumvirate that conspired to murder our 35th president. This was the most boring answer, but it at least verified what everyone already knew.', 'By the 1990s, though, the Committee of the Obelisk had fallen out of fashion after years of corporate funding and corruption. This controversy exploded in 1997 when the question put forth by the committee, which at the time was headed by the CFO of Pepsico, was “What’s the best tasting carbonated soft drink on the market today?”', 'The obelisk’s answer, to the chairman’s great disappointment, was Surge.', 'Today, whoever is called on by the obelisk is given free rein to ask whatever they choose, however many news outlets regularly publish lists of recommended questions. But there is always the risk that someone will ask something frivolous like “What’s Jason Mraz up to these days?” or “Where is the body of my missing father?” (God, please don’t call on Susan Willman. She’ll blow it.)', 'And now a word from our sponsors.', '###', 'Are you tired of wrinkled shirts? Do your clothes get static cling?

No single phrase discernable above the others.', 'Susan looked around, her big goofy eyes scanning the people around her as if she would actually lower herself to listen to their questions. She thinks she’s so high and mighty with her PTA officer status and her hit broadway musical production.', 'No, Susan’s above us all. Just as important as can be. She waved her arms like wings for quiet. And the audience obeyed. She’s so self-important, so attention-seeking.', 'And then she asked her question. The one question we as a town get only every decade or so, and Susan said “Hey, so what’s your name?”', 'What’s your name??? What a waste! Did she forget we only get one question? The crowd began to boo. Or I did. I started booing, and I am part of the crowd.', 'The obelisk began to speak only into Susan’s mind, and Susan listened closely. She giggled at first, like a little girl hearing a silly joke from a grandfather. Then her tear-filled laughs turned into tear-filled breaths, which eventually became tear-filled sobs. After about 3 minutes the obelisk vanished, and Susan stood alone on the small hill between the Wailing Pit and the Memorial Debris Heap and she told us what she heard. Or she told us ', ' of what she heard.', 'Susan said in an unusually booming, authoritative voice: “Whosoever speaks aloud the name of the obelisk shall become the obelisk. Whosoever becomes the obelisk shall live forever. Whosoever lives forever shall know all things. Whosoever knows all things shall be damned. And whosoever hears the name of the obelisk spoken aloud shall perish.”', 'The crowd parted for Susan as she left the park. They mumbled their disappointment in both the question and its answer.', 'Some spoke with pity, some with disdain, while some thought it was all pretty cool and new. “Much better than last time when Dave asked who would win the 2013 NBA Championships” said one person. “Dave won a lot of money on that answer though,” responded another, “He has a yacht now, over at the Harbor and Waterfront Recreation Area.”', 'But most everyone whispered their fear for Susan’s power itself.

Last year’s winners were Joel Eisenberg and his partner Danny Jimenez who dressed in a tandem outfit of a stegosaurus. I was there, listeners, and it was impressive. The creature was so realistic-looking. The craftsmanship of the costume was top-notch, but I have to confess I’m always more into high-concept creativity than realistic details when it comes to costumes. I remember the 2015 Gala when Amal Shamoun came dressed up as the concept of ennui. She made herself 12 feet tall, dressed in a taupe long-coat, and created a constant drizzling rain inside the ballroom. Anyone who looked at her got super sad and wanted a hug. But Joel and Danny’s stegosaurus was fine.', 'Sunday afternoon is the Fall Craft Sale in Old Town Night Vale; an inscrutable maze of stalls showcasing the finest products from our town’s artisans.

The girl watched TV alone in the dark living room, only the bluish flicker of a scary movie illuminating her face. The phone rang, abrupt and loud, startling her.', 'She raised the receiver to her ear.', '“Hello,” she said with a slight quiver.', '“Have you checked on the children,” came a raspy voice.', 'The babysitter ran quickly upstairs, opening the door of the kids’ bedroom.

And again. And again: “Have you checked on the children?” The babysitter, so scared, barely able to move, hung up the phone before the voice could finish its repeated query.', 'When the phone rang once again, she answered and shouted “stop calling me!” But this time, it was a different voice.', 'The person on this occasion said: “Ma’am, this is the police. We’ve traced the call. The call is coming from inside the house. Get out. Get out!”', 'The babysitter panicked and started to run, but then she remembered… she never called the police. How would they know to even trace the call? She crept fearfully upstairs to the children’s room. The phone was ringing again, the clamoring bell igniting her fright. She cracked open the door and she saw… She saw the young McDowell boy and his little brother hunched over a phone and giggling.', 'They were pranking her, and she felt relieved, but embarrassed.

She would not tell him.', 'One day the man and the woman were to become husband and wife. In her white bridal dress the woman still wore her green ribbon. The man asked her on their wedding night if he could untie the green ribbon, but even on the most intimate of evenings, she said no, and he respected her answer. But he longed to know what she was hiding behind the ribbon.', 'Through the years, the man asked the wife again about the ribbon, but she never removed it, nor answered his questions about it. She only warned him that he would not like what he saw if she were to remove it. He asked less and less, but his curiosity grew and grew.', 'They became old, very old, and they knew their time left was short. The man asked one more time: “My dearest wife, love of my life, tell me that I may remove the green ribbon from around thy neck.”', 'The old woman said: “My adoring groom, here in our room, after all these many years, yes, you may. But I caution you, as I have many times before, that you shall not like what your eyes behold.”', 'The man hesitated, but finally reached his weakened, wrinkled fingers to the green bow along her nape. He tentatively pulled the ribbon, and suddenly it unfurled falling from her neck.

I then went to the Hall of Public Records and found that our radio station was built in 1850, atop the very train tracks where James met his end.', 'James’s soul has been wandering the halls and offices of our radio station ever since. For all James ever wanted to be was a radio intern, to serve the listening community, to lift high the voice of journalistic truth. And it was his death that led to the shutdown of those train tracks and the eventual construction of a new station home, and the building we still use now.', 'I was wrong about James. He was an intern, after all, and not a malevolent Halloween spirit. But I was right that the Autumn Specter had come for me.

I did not notice its soul-reaping sickle, which it had raised high above its oversized head and stick-thin body.', 'James had given his life for the building of our radio station. And in death, he gave his soul for the very same cause. James threw himself upon the Autumn Specter. He tried to stab the Specter’s neck and chest, but it did nothing.

She was put into hibernation so that she could wake up and serve as reinforcement in the Blood Space War at some point in the future.

I am a Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home watching you download yet another video game, Caleb.\\xa0', 'But seeing people and being with people are different things. Different ideas all together. I miss touch most of all. A father’s hand. A friend’s arms. A lover’s chest.\\xa0', 'I still touch. Am touched. But it’s not the same. It is not a mutual touch. My touch is unwelcome, unfriendly, unwanted.\\xa0', 'Yet I touch because I love. And I love you, Caleb. I do. I know you don’t believe me, after what I did to you tonight, but I do. My love is not romantic, nor maternal. It’s not platonic either. I love you the way a deer loves a cornfield. It is safe. It is nourishing. It is in its DNA to want to be there. To hide. To eat. To play.\\xa0', 'You’re very much like a cornstalk, Caleb. You are loved and you are benign… better than benign… you are a contribution to this world. The cornstalk is unaware that a deer loves it so much that it will bend it and stomp it until its edible morsels spill out from its crumpled, empty husk. The cornstalks – there are so many cornstalks – do not understand that they are so loved by the deer as to be devoured.\\xa0', 'You’ve seen a kitten before, Caleb. I know you have. Sometimes kittens are so cute. SO SO SO CUTE that you want to put them in your mouth. Do you understand that kind of love, Caleb? That kind of touch?', 'You do not. No one does. And this is why I am lonely.\\xa0', 'But I think you know that. You’re different. You’re lonely, too.\\xa0', 'That’s not what makes you different. We’re all lonely in our own way. You’re different, Caleb, because you know I am here. You see me even when I do not want to be seen. No one has been able to do that in at least 200 years. Sometimes you speak to me. Not in terror, not in rage. I have heard many of these voices in my life from those who feared and detested my presence. No, you ask me my name. (I won’t tell you. Not yet.) You tell me about your day. (I’m sorry your new boss is so mean. I will rectify this.) And last night, you prepared a dinner for me.\\xa0', 'You’re not a good cook. I can smell that much. But it was your gesture of generosity that touched me. You made cacio e pepe, a recipe you learned from TikTok. And you prepared a bowl just for me. You waited to see if I would appear, and when I did not, you told me you understood wanting to eat alone, so you left it for me on the dining room table, as you went to play the new Flight Simulator.\\xa0', 'Few men have ever been this kind to me without being frightened into it first. Or without using their kindness as a disguise. I think you genuinely understand your own quiet desperation among the mass of men. And in turn, you understand others’ too.\\xa0', 'I don’t trust the kindness of men, Caleb. I don’t trust the kindness of women either. Or anyone else’s kindness, to be truthful. But I especially do not trust men’s kindness.\\xa0', 'There are exceptions. Andre, whose kindness was loyalty and honesty. And Albert – although his was a much different kind of kindness. But Caleb… 23-year-old, unshaven, video-game-loving, boss-hating, aimless Caleb… your kindness frightens me.\\xa0', 'I am scared of what you want. What it is you plan to take from me. Kind men have stolen my childhood, my morals, my money, my love, my life, and my family. What will you take from me, Caleb, that I have not already lost?', 'I am afraid. I am afraid to respond to your gentle bait of friendship. Because I am afraid you will take my loneliness from me. I am lonely, and that is a choice I have made for myself.', 'One day, Caleb, you will die. I know exactly when. It will not be at my hand. Although, I will do nothing to stop it. It is my fate, my path, to know such things. And in your death, you will return my loneliness to me, and it will be a horror to behold, bloody and misshapen. My loneliness, not recognizing its former owner, will howl an unholy and unceasing cry. And I will not be able to bear it.\\xa0', 'This is what I fear, Caleb. And this is why I took the bowl of cacio e pepe you left for me and hurled it against the wall, just missing your cheek. I’m not sad that you screamed at me. I am happy that you did so. This is how it has to be. We are not enemies, Caleb. No no. I love you deeply. Deeper than you can know. I am your deer, Caleb, and you are my corn.\\xa0', '###', 'CECIL: The fiery flash of fall leaves stuns us, captivates us. Fireworks in slow motion. Or the crackling embers of a finishing flame. Upon the leaves are written instructions for how to make oxygen. How to give life with every exhalation. How to find flare in fading grace. And how to raise new life by falling to your death. The leaves know they will return again. So much will return again. We return now to the October Monologues.', '###', 'MICHELLE: There’s this new song I like. But I don’t want to tell you what it is. I find it kind of embarrassing.', 'Usually I love to talk about my favorite music. There was that summer I was obsessed with the new single by St. Vincent. The single came in the form of a glazed vase containing three blue flowers. Only one was ever made, and I got the only copy. I found it very catchy, but the flowers eventually died.', 'Or the year I spent listening over and over to that new Janelle Monae album. I forget the name, but the cover was a black and white picture of a well, and if you didn’t share it with someone else in seven days you’d die. Of course, no one ever died because the album was so good people just couldn’t stop telling their friends to listen.', 'My favorite song of all time is a blank cassette tape, still in its plastic wrapper. It was owned by a man named Gary Choi. He was a real estate lawyer, reasonably successful, but he always dreamed of being a singer songwriter. He dreamed all the time of quitting his job and writing songs, but he had never even written one song. Then one day, in a fit of optimism and energy, he bought this cassette, intending to make his first demo. But the day got away from him, and then the week, and then the rest of his life, and he never quit being a lawyer, and he never wrote even one song. This blank cassette tape, still in its wrapper, contains the potential of all the songs he could have written, but never did, which is better and more powerful than any actual song anyone’s managed to actually write. The potential of a thing is always more perfect than the reality of the thing. However, and this is the crucial drawback, the potential is absolutely useless and the reality, however imperfect, can be quite useful. Anyway, I like to hold Gary Choi’s unwritten demo, and imagine what it would be like.', 'Hold on sorry, there’s a customer.', '[off-mic]', 'Welcome to Dark Owl Records.', 'What?', 'No.', 'No.', 'No.', 'No.', 'No.', 'Ok, bye.', '[on-mic]', 'Sorry about that. Some people are so unreasonable. I don’t even know what a Taylor Swift is.', 'But there’s a new song I like. And it’s not cool like my other favorite songs. It’s not a song that fits the kind of image I like to project. When I put on my mirrored leggings, and my extra long jorts, and my really big hat, people expect something from me. They expect me to be on the cutting edge. They expect me to only be into bands that aren’t popular yet, or will never be popular, or that frankly don’t know how to play their instruments very well.', 'And the song I like now, it’s not any of those things. It’s ordinary. It’s...popular.', 'I don’t want to say what it is. Remember when I only listened to the sound of bees buzzing? That was a good summer. Of course, I got stung once or twice or thirty times.', 'Hold on, sorry, there’s a customer.', '[off-mic]', 'Welcome to Dark Owl Records.', 'Hey!', 'Hey!', 'Hey!', 'Hey!!', 'Hey!!!', 'Thanks, nice to see you again.', '[back on mic]', 'Sorry about that.', 'I’m tired of being cool. I was going to say “trying to be cool”, but trying implies the possibility of failure, and there has never been a moment where I failed to be cool. But here’s the hard truth I’ve come up against: Being cool is a young person’s game.', 'And that’s not because young people are better or more interesting than older people. God no. God no. God no. It’s that coolness itself is a concept tied to youth. Coolness is a reactionary manifestation of insecurity. The more insecure you are, the more cool you need to be. It’s colorful plumage.', 'But as I’ve gotten older, I no longer need flashy plumage. I just want to sit in the comfort of who I am, and not worry about what that looks like from the outside.', 'Anyway, I can’t stop listening to Karma Police by Radiohead.

Now, the words sputter and drop in spiraling arcs to the ground. Here, then are the final few brightly painted words falling upon you now… The October Monologues.', '###', 'STEVE: What does it mean to be believed?', 'I’ve always known that Night Vale isn’t like other places. As long as I can remember, I could see that. I also could see that no one else could see it. I was alone in my knowledge. Knowledge may be power, but power is often lonely. My grandfather knew. He could see that I was like him. “Steve,” he would say. “Us Carlsbergs have always been the town pariahs. But just because they hate you doesn’t mean they’re right.”', 'I would sit at night as a kid, and listen to Cecil on the radio. He was the same age as he is now, and at the time he seemed so wise. But I would hear him dismiss what I knew shouldn’t be dismissed. I would hear him cover up what should be uncovered. And I would know with a child’s certainty that it was wrong. I loved him still. Everyone in town loves Cecil. It is possible to love someone who you know is doing wrong. It’s terribly easy, in fact.', 'What does it mean to be believed?', 'As a teenager, I started trying to express what I saw about the world. I gave a presentation in my social studies class, called: Night Vale: There’s Literally No Where Like It. I thought it was informative. The class all plugged their ears in unison. The teacher stopped me a minute in, glancing nervously at the eight surveillance cameras monitoring the classroom. “Are you trying to get us all killed?” the teacher hissed at me. I remember that her breath smelled like strawberry jolly ranchers, and there was a loose crumb of mascara in the sweat of her temples.', '“No,” I said. I didn’t know what to say. It’s not the kind of question that demands a sincere answer. That report earned me a trip to the principal’s office, and then the Reeducation Pit, which honestly is not as bad as its name. I mean, almost not as bad. It’s pretty bad. It’s a pit. For reeducation. So.', 'I certainly learned something from that reeducation. I learned that you’re equally likely to be punished for being right as you are for being wrong.', 'What does it mean to be believed?', 'I was a young man, entering the workforce, and I had long ago learned to hide away what I knew about our city. I had learned the handshake and the smile, the nod and the necktie, all the signifiers that hid what I truly signified. All of life is a code, and I had been taught the key against my will.\\xa0', 'I got a job as a bank teller at The Last Bank of Night Vale. I studied with great interest the townsfolk who came and went there. I learned about their lives, and their secrets, and what kind of money they made from the whispered deals out back in quiet parking lots just before the sun went down, pulled up next to a black sedan that contained their handler who they only knew by a false first name.', 'But I couldn’t forget what I knew, even if I learned to playact that I had. What I know shapes who I am. I can’t close my eyes, not to this town I love. This weird and secret town I love.', 'What does it mean to be believed?', 'Then I married into the family of Cecil Palmer, host of Night Vale Community Radio. And he hated me. Because he could see that I knew. And after all these years, my mask had slipped a little. I had lost my interest in hiding. I wanted to speak the truth as I knew it. Nothing could be more threatening to Cecil. His life and livelihood depending on speaking the truth as the City Council wanted it, or as the Vague Yet Menacing Government Agencies crafted it. And here I was. Pointing out to him the sky.', 'There are glowing arrows in the sky.', 'There are dotted lines and arrows and circles. The sky is a chart that explains the entire world.', 'I tried to tell this to him, and this only made him hate me more.', 'I tried to share who I was with him, and this only made him recoil.', 'Abby listened to my stories, but she never shared my enthusiasm for the truth. “Let it lie,” she would say. “Let it lie.”', 'But that’s the point. I can’t let it lie and I can’t lie. We’ve done that for too long. We’ve let our town sit heavy under the weight of euphemism and half truth. And unless someone just said what they saw for once, we would be crushed eventually by that weight.', 'Then it all changed. I wasn’t alone. The others saw that we lived in a weird place. And do you know what? We kept existing. Our world didn’t end merely because we dared acknowledge it.', 'Cecil and I are friends now. I haven’t forgotten how he treated me. But I understand it. And I forgive it. Forgiveness and understanding are not the same as forgetting.\\xa0', 'What does it mean to be believed?', 'It means everything.', 'It means it all.', '###', 'CECIL: And as the leaves are done, so are the October Monologues.

      "['Welcome back to another episode of Bloody Laws, Bloody Claws: The Murder of Frank Chen. I am, as always, your host Cecil Palmer. This is our, wow, 722nd episode, can you believe we’ve only been doing this since December? And this is likely to be our final episode as today Judge Chaplin is scheduled to issue her long-awaited verdict. We’re going to bring this verdict to you live, but of course this is a podcast not community radio, so you will later download that live recording by which point it will not be live. I’m not 100% up on all this tech stuff, but wow is the money better in true crime podcasting than community radio. Who knew, right? I was very surprised.', 'If this is your first time joining us on Bloody Laws, Bloody Claws, welcome welcome. For the best experience you really should start at episode one and listen to all 721 previous episodes in order, but I’m sure the Chen Friends, as my fans call themselves, will welcome you in and let you know what’s been going on. Join them on the discord and the twitch chat and the subreddit and the patreon. I have no idea what any of those things are, but I’ve been told firmly by my producer that you cannot make anything now without having all of those things. In the meantime, let’s get to a quick recap of the case.', 'So this story, as you Chen Friends know, goes all the way back, if you can believe it, to 2012. Put yourself in that moment in time. Annette Benning is president (and don’t I wish that was still the case). Yo-yos are big again. No one would be caught dead in jorts, not like today in which, due to new city ordinances, you can be dead if caught without them. And a five headed dragon named Hiram McDaniels is pulled over while driving a pick-up truck that belongs to a human man named Frank Chen. When asked for ID, Hiram hands over Frank’s drivers license, and explains that he is normal human Frank Chen. The police have no reason to doubt Hiram, and so they let him go. But later that day, the real Frank Chen’s body is found, covered in burns and large claw marks. Just what happened to Frank Chen? Who killed him? And what does Hiram McDaniels, literal five headed dragon, have to do with all this? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out, in the metaphorical pages of this literal podcast.\\xa0', 'When criminal charges never came, and Hiram McDaniels fled town after the death of one of his five heads, the family of Frank Chen turned to the civil courts for justice. They filed suit against Hiram McDaniels, as well as the city of Night Vale and the Sheriff’s Secret Police for negligence in the investigation. This suit has gone on for almost a year now, and it has taken a heavy toll on this town, making us dwell on an ugly and murderous chapter in our history. On the other hand, it turns out a true crime podcast about an active case is basically printing money, so it’s not all bad.', 'Which reminds me, we need to get to our first sponsor. Our sponsor today is FruitBox. It’s a box of fruit. Comes in the mail once a week. You don’t get to choose the fruit. Might be eight apples and a kiwi. Might only be one banana. You do NOT get to choose the fruit. ', 'don’t even choose the fruit. We just close our eyes and throw it in there at random from a big fruit pile we keep in our office, and then we seal the box without looking.

What’s in the box? What’s in the box?!? Relax buddy, it’s just fruit.', 'Now, as usual at this point in our podcast, let’s bring in our legal expert to talk us through the intricate matters of jurisprudence involved in a big case like this. So I turn it over to our legal expert, the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home:', 'FOW: Thank you, Cecil.\\xa0', 'In order to properly consider this case, one must look at the full history of Dragon Law.\\xa0', 'The first recorded legal case involving dragons was in the year 706, in which a dragon ate most of a shepherd’s\\xa0flock, and the shepherd went to his local chieftain with the complaint. The chieftain ruled that it was absolutely aggravating what the dragon did, but at that point the dragon had flown off and there was nothing much anyone could do about it.\\xa0', 'The next case was in 1291, in which a dragon sued to get her cave back from a local lord who had begun to stripmine the cave for iron. The dragon explained that the clanging and banging was interrupting her sleep habits, and she wanted them out of there, or else. The specifics of her “or else” was made imminently clear when she huffed a white hot burst of flame from her nostrils. Unfortunately for her, courts at that time were judged by the local lords, and he ruled against her in the case of her vs. him. Unfortunately for him, she made good on her “or else” and burned him to a crisp, at which point the miners were all freed from their cruel labors and celebrated the death of the tyrant. So that one worked out pretty well.', 'The last case I want to point to is from 1971, in which it was ruled that incorporeal, ghostly, or otherwise inhuman beings are allowed to live in homes, secretly or otherwise, no matter the wishes of those they are haunting. This doesn’t have anything to do with dragons, but it’s a case that is very important to me, for reasons I will whisper in your ear tonight as you toss and turn, wishing with all your heart for sleep that will never come.\\xa0', 'CECIL: Thanks Faceless Old Woman. Fascinating. Say, where did you study law?', 'FOW: I’ve never studied law, but I’ve spent centuries on the wrong side of it. That teaches you everything you need to know.', 'CECIL: Makes total sense and I have no further questions. Let’s move on.', 'Coming from community radio, I wasn’t aware of the larger world of podcasts. Did you know that 90% of podcasts are now multimedia empires? It’s true, or at least according to my new agent. I’ve never met her, but she promises that I’ll be rich beyond my wildest dreams. I merely had to supply my bank information to her and she would make sure that money would come raining in. Which it hasn’t yet. If anything, my account seems a little smaller. But she explained that this is just a glitch, and that the big bucks are coming. She kept shouting “the big bucks are coming” over and over until I had to hang up.', 'In any case, she said she’s gotten me a book deal. My book in progress is called Hiram: Portrait of A Five Headed Murderer. Also I’m developing a TV show that is going to be on Fritz, the new streaming channel only available in smart refrigerators. And we’re planning a 60 city speaking tour, in which I will be reenacting what I think happened to Frank Chen using puppets and the voice acting classes at the community center that Carlos got me for my birthday.\\xa0', 'So many exciting new steps in my new career. I wonder what my agent’s name is. I never did ask. Probably not important.\\xa0', 'Now, it’s time, before we reach the verdict, to exhaustively go through the evidence, one by one. Pick through it, discuss what we think it means. Maybe bring on a few more experts to chat about each item. This could take a while. First up--\\xa0', 'CARLOS: [off-mic through this] Hey sweetie. Are you recording your show again?', 'CECIL: [remains on-mic] Yes, you’re on it right now. They’re listening.', 'CARLOS: But you can edit this out right? Because podcasts aren’t live.', 'CECIL: I don’t know what “edit” means.\\xa0', 'CARLOS: Ok, I just wanted to let you know that I made lunch. It’s pasta salad, just the way you like it. Dry and crunchy.\\xa0', 'CECIL: That’s so sweet Carlos. But I can’t leave right now. The verdict is about to happen.', 'CARLOS: No, I get it. That’s why I brought it to you.', 'CECIL: Thanks my little tortoise.', 'CARLOS: Enjoy. Say hi to your Frank Bunch', 'CECIL: Chen Friends', 'CARLOS: Sure, say hi to them. And you should definitely edit this bit out. I’ll show you how later.', 'CECIL: I can’t imagine what that entails. Goodbye sweetie.', 'Ok, it’s time for our second sponsor. Got to pay the bills. No such thing as a free lunch. Unless your sweet husband brings you pasta salad at the courthouse while you’re recording your podcast. In that case, lunch is free.', 'Today’s sponsor is MeUndies. Think about the first person in history who intentionally made a fire. It’s possible that this was far enough back it wasn’t technically a person, as in a homo sapien, it could have been a neanderthal. Flame sprang from their actions, an idea made hot and tangible. Where before they had to wait for fire to start by an accident of nature, and then to save those coals for their use, now fire was theirs to be had whenever they needed. I bet cooked food has never tasted so good, not before nor since.\\xa0', 'Think of them lying in the grass, watching over their little fire, like it was a child, because like a child, if it was not watched over and tended correctly, it could grow to be big and dangerous. Think of the pure joy of starting a fire.', 'MeUndies: It’s underwear, you know?', 'Oh, it looks like the big moment is here. Judge Chaplin has arrived and is setting up for her verdict reveal. She’s seeding the room with some hidden aces and flowers so that she can make them appear later, and I think there might be wires leading to the ceiling for some kind of levitation portion of the show.\\xa0', 'While she does that, let’s go, as we always go at this point in an episode of Bloody Laws, to an unrelated song.', '[weather: “The Ghost Who Wasn’t There“ by A Sunday Fire http://asundayfire.bandcamp.com]', 'I come to you part way into Judge Chaplin’s verdict. We’ve made it through most of the floor show, and she is just finishing up sawing the bailiff in half, so we should get to the legal meat of it soon. Ooooh, ok, I did not expect doves to fly out of the bailiff like that. Very impressive. Maybe the most impressive verdict I’ve seen since Judge Houdini sentenced fifteen petty thieves in consecutive trials to community service, all the while escaping from a padlocked mail sack dropped to the bottom of the Vltava river [pronounced VUHL-tuh-vuh].\\xa0', 'But now we’ve reached the decisive moment. Judge Chaplin is indicating that whoever has the king of hearts in their breast pocket is the winning side. Both legal teams are patting themselves down. And it’s…the family of Frank Chen. The Judge has found in favor of the plaintiff. The court is chattering, and one guy with a podcast is loudly narrating everything as it happens, so the judge is banging her gavel for order.\\xa0', 'She finds that the City of Night Vale, the Sheriff’s Secret Police, Hiram McDaniels, and an omniscient conception of God are all responsible in their own way for the death of Frank Chen and the subsequent lack of justice for his murderer. Hiram McDaniels fled town years ago, and no one has any idea where he is. And God hasn’t been seen around here since at least the 70s, so it looks like the brunt of the responsibility is going to come down on the City and the Police.', 'It has come time to award damages. Judge Chaplin explains that she believes in a simple kind of justice. That the best way to make things whole is to rectify the situation directly, and so the family of Frank Chen is owed…Frank Chen’s life. They are owed one living Frank Chen, until the date of his natural death, whenever that was supposed to be. If they fail to produce this within one calendar year, all of their assets, including the town of Night Vale, will be turned over to the family of Frank Chen.\\xa0', 'Listeners, this is unprecedented. I am unclear how a city is supposed to bring a man who has been dead for eight years back to life, and it seems the city does not know either. But honestly, it’s a fair verdict. The City of Night Vale’s lawyers are looking at each other with their hands in their hair, shaking their heads, and mouthing things like “But that’s impossible” and “I really didn’t expect this trial to turn out this way.”', 'Oh this is so exciting. It will take me at least another year of this podcast to properly analyze the verdict and its implications. And of course to follow the City and Sheriff’s Secret Police as they attempt to delve into the ultimate mystery of life and death, in order to fulfill the court’s judgment. Thank god. I was really wondering what I was going to do if I lost this podcast income. I had gotten used to the lavish podcast lifestyle and wasn’t ready to return to the simple hermitage of community radio just yet. ', 'This wraps it up for the not-final episode of Bloody Laws, Bloody Claws. All of you Chen Friends join me for my usual four hour behind the scenes commentary episode on our patreon, in which I analyze my analysis in this episode.', 'And as I always say at the end of this podcast:', 'That about does it for me, Night Vale. That about does it for me.']\n"
