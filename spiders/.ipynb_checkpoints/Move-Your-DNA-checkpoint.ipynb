Because what a stick allows you to do is 1) it increases your base of support so it reduces your body\\'s need to do it\\'s own work to stabilize itself. That was nice... and the other thing that it does is that it allows you to kind of use your arms as legs, right? It allows you to share the work.

Like you go up on all fours but I see people come through and now I see 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds hiking 5-mile hikes, 3-mile hikes with their boots, and their poles and what they\\'re doing is they are experiencing a supported, more stable walk. Right? That\\'s the benefit. The adaptation, I won\\'t even say that it\\'s not the benefit but the adaptation is, your body is less able to do that without the sticks. So no sticks, you don\\'t have that same level of support. So you train towards needing something outside of your body to stabilize you. That then puts you at risk anytime you don\\'t have those sticks. So... the trans... if you\\'re on them and you already have mileage then the plan would be, can you do portions of it without? If you\\'re doing short hikes, can you go without?

       "' links and resources mentioned in the show: find more SPEAKER REDACTED more about SPEAKER brass make a donation to help SPEAKER\\'s work SPEAKER’s instagram post on pool swimming events in canada and europe : katie sawatzky the dynamic collective venn design earthrunners my mayu soft star shoes unshoes  sign up for SPEAKER’s newsletter at  nutritiousmovement.com access all previous move your dna podcasts via your podcast provider of choice (stitcher, itunes, libsyn, or soundcloud). podcast transcript it\\'s the move your dna podcast with SPEAKER REDACTED. i\\'m SPEAKER REDACTED, biomechanist and author of  move your dna  and a bunch of other books about movement. this show is about how movement works on the cellular level, how to change your position as you move and why you might want to, and how movement works in the world; also known as movement ecology. all bodies are welcome. are you ready to get moving?  music  SPEAKER: hello friends. this is the 10th episode in this short series of interviews i\\'m doing on movement; specifically the many ways movement - specifically the many ways people consider movement outside of exercise. i’d like to do a small shout out to dr. ihi heke, who i interviewed in  episode 99 , whose sharing of his indigenous perspective on movement and REDACTED has been our most popular episode according to itunes. so, yay! you and hear it in my voice, it\\'s hoarse, from just saying “yay” and expressing gratitude to everyone who shared. especially my new zealand listeners. i really appreciated you getting the word out about dr. heke\\'s work. he is such an important voice in this movement movement. we\\'re starting to tune into to other cultural perspectives which is why i am excited to talk to SPEAKER brass today. he\\'s a member of the peepeekisis first nation on the treaty four territory of canada, for another indigenous perspective on natural movement.   but before we get there, i’ve got some questions on natural movement to answer. these are brought to you by our dynamic collective, which is a co-op of sponsors that includes:  softstar,   mymayu ,  unshoes ,  earth runner,  and  venn design  - all companies that support some lifestyle element of natural movement, from minimal footwear; sandals, boots, running footwear, something to wear with your nice clothes. something that you can feel comfortable taking camping and backpacking - for all ages and all seasons - to minimal furniture that includes sitting cushions and balls that allow more of you to move while you’re just sitting there. these companies sponsor this question and answer portion of each episode of move your dna. and you can find more about them in our show notes.  so anyway,   i posted on instagram  and there was a lot of discussion in the instagram post, so i\\'ll like to that post in my show notes. but there was this great question from kate. and her comment was: \"no way!!\" i\\'m assuming she said it like that because she put a bunch of exclamation points. \"no way!\" that\\'s how canadians talk. \"i take my kids to the pool every week during the cold months and i always think “SPEAKER wouldn’t count this as movement” because it isn’t weight bearing. am i wrong?!? i’m so happy to hear otherwise!\" so you can see exactly what i wrote back to her but for those of you who listen to this podcast, i\\'m already here for the answer. it\\'s like of course, of course swimming is a natural movement and i find it to be a critical natural movement skill given the fact that many of us will encounter bodies of water in our life and not only because it\\'s fun but because it can be life-saving natural movement knowledge. right? if we change the word skill to knowledge and say i have the knowledge of how to move through the water then it\\'s very important. is it weight bearing? no. does all movement have to be weight bearing? no. so i guess as i explained to her: natural movement is a collection of many many movements so i would absolutely consider swimming to be a vitamin. it\\'s just that, right now, in a sedentary culture where we are picking and choosing maybe the one or two vitamins that we are going to consume, it isn\\'t weight bearing and so due to the laws of specificity and that we adapt to the movement that we do, you can get a ton of movement nutrients from water but you can\\'t get all of them. so many people will use water as a therapeutic approach. and not just children but adults because for those who experience pain when they bear weight it\\'s a way to allow them to continue to move. i get it. it\\'s fun. you can use water in many ways. you can certainly increase the movement nutrition found in a bout of swimming by considering all of the ways that you use your body and what you\\'re doing when you come to a body of water. for kids, i just would recommend just like maybe as a nutritionist would to make sure that swimming wasn\\'t the only motion that was being done. it\\'s certainly better than nothing and it\\'s absolutely something to be doing regularly to build up that skill set. but i don\\'t think that it replaces another movement nutrient. so that\\'s my only commentary on it. do i think it\\'s awesome? rad. do i count it as movement? yes. so, am i wrong? yeah, i would say that if you thought that i don\\'t see swimming as a natural movement or something valuable, that\\'s absolutely not the case. i would like to ensure that everyone had the ability to move through water in the best way that they can. so anyway. thanks, kate!   so, here’s a question from ines, who writes… \"the last time i bought shoes i chose one size larger than i have been buying in the past years. do you know whether increased foot mobility actually can lead to lengthening and expanding of the feet? is that a thing? i\\'ve been doing the exercises from   whole body barefoot  and  simple steps to foot pain relief , as well as walking lots more in general and in minimal shoes. and alternatively, could it simply be that i\\'m more aware of toe and wiggle-space, such that previously i wasn\\'t realizing my shoes were too small but now i am? thank you and just so you know, your work is having an impact on my life!\" and obviously your feet, ines. so thank you for this question. it\\'s a great question. so i would say that it can be both. it could be that maybe really maybe you hadn\\'t been paying attention to what your toes were doing in shoes before that your toes might not even have been extended to their full length before. many people, especially generations previously where you might only get one pair of shoes a year when you were a kid, a lot of people report that they learned how to shorten their toes or kind of claw their toes which makes their whole foot length less because they did not like the sensation of bumping up against the end of their shoe and they were obviously growing while they were wearing their shoes. so it could be that, yes, you had just now started to feel the way your toes are interacting with your shoes and so you are buying a shoe one size larger because now that gives you the space but also quite often people experience an increase in the size of their foot. and so it\\'s interesting this idea of mobility seem to again, in our minds, we hold in a vacuum which is like, my toes can just go through greater ranges of motion. whether it\\'s spreading apart, lifting up high, and that is true, but at the same time it\\'s also not happening in a vacuum meaning if you have a lot of foot tension, the resting length of your foot is less. so when people develop strength in the rest of their foot, they change the height of the arch. so in  move your dna  i was really trying to call out that you are actually changing the lengths, you\\'re changing the lengths of certain segments. because you\\'re usually measuring length along one particular plane. so it\\'s not that the bones themselves are getting longer, it\\'s that when you start playing around with multiple planes of orientation you will affect things like length. same thing like height. they took my dad to the doctor - this is going to be a classic SPEAKER REDACTED aside - when i took my dad to the doctor they measured his height. and it was like, \"oh you shrunk an inch.\" he was 89. and so she was just quickly explaining that the volume of your discs gets less and you know that can be one case. and i said, \"also though, if you\\'re not measuring how much farther forward his head or shoulders are, it can be that if your spine is just curling forward, your height is now traveling around a curve and not straight up.\" so since you\\'re measuring height along the wall it could just be that he\\'s more forward. and it was like, \"uh...what?\" and then i showed her quickly the math. if you just take a string and move it forward, i said, \"you see height, his segment length, hasn\\'t changed. he doesn\\'t necessarily have shorter vertebral bodies.\" the height of the vertebrae themselves, or less mass in the disk. it\\'s just oriented in a different plane than what you were measuring. same with the foot. so maybe that\\'s the holdup. it\\'s like, \"could my bones be getting longer?\" probably not. could you have through muscle tension constantly chronically holding your foot to a functional length that is different than what those segments of your bones allowed? yes. so anyway. you\\'re welcome, ines, for that long sidebar about the time i had with my dad. i guess you know when people pass away don\\'t you want to talk about them all the time? i do. and when you combine that with someone who also wants to just talk all the time? there you go. anyway, thank you  soft star,  everyone else in the collective:  unshoes ,  earthrunner,   venn design ; maker of beautiful dynamic living space decor, and  mymayu  outdoor boots for kids. for more information on these companies go to the show notes, click listen,  click podcast transcripts . they\\'re linked on the top of the notes. and if you have a question please send it to me via  podcast@nutritiousmovement.com . i want to answer it. so let\\'s do this.  SPEAKER:    SPEAKER: hello. thank you!  SPEAKER: we were trying to talk briefly about how we met and neither one of us can remember the name of the conference but saskatchewan first nations, we believe it\\'s the nutritionist…?  SPEAKER: yeah it took place at the treaty four governance center in fort qu\\'appelle saskatchewan and yeah, i believe it was REDACTED canada. it was dieticians there from throughout the province, of course, different first nations staff. i think mostly REDACTED staff that were present about a year and a half ago.   SPEAKER: yeah. it was september. so i guess we\\'re on the year and a half mark. it was beautiful and so we got a chance to work together. and i\\'m just really happy that you are here for reasons i think will become obvious. you are really immersed in a lot of things that maybe my listeners here understand in a theoretical way - or they\\'re trying to learn more about maybe their role in their environment and i just think that your perspective - your work - is so important so i\\'d like to share it. so i guess i\\'d like to start with my first questions which is: what does natural movement mean to you?  SPEAKER: yeah. and that\\'s such a juggernaut of a question. you know, because i think natural movement really goes and affects all aspects of life whether it be our physical REDACTED, the REDACTED of our - our mental REDACTED politics, and our life practices every day, in trying to find a sustainable path forward for future generations. so on just a practical level, as an individual, natural movement is something that, as i\\'m aging and beginning to feel the aches and pains from my life, it\\'s become very much of a conscious effort to go back to movements that our ancestors would have been familiar with, you know, finding just better ways to sit, or to squat, and to walk. all of these different ways that we see the toll that sitting in chairs or our cars and what have you, or repetitive movement through industrialized working conditions - just to see what that\\'s doing to our bodies and doing to our communities and doing to our ability to maintain cultural REDACTED in our communities.     SPEAKER: right. yeah well for myself, indigenous food sovereignty is really recognizing just how important our food culture is to the overall well being of indigenous nations. i mean we can expand that out to all human culture but of course, i spend my time as an indigenous person focused on reclaiming indigenous ways of knowing and being, recovering from the effects of colonialism here in north america. and in my journey in life whether it be participating in our spiritual institutes and ceremonies, or whether it be just some of our festivals, such as pow wow or other aspects of culture, i\\'ve come to understand that our food culture really is the core.  SPEAKER: um-hmm.  SPEAKER: people will say language is the foundation of our culture where i would argue that it\\'s actually our food culture that is the foundation and it\\'s that food culture that gave birth to our languages.  SPEAKER: mm.  SPEAKER: so we see in language recovery of indigenous languages, the language retention doesn\\'t seem to really get traction when students are trying to learn in a classroom environment. but when we put them back on the land and when they\\'re on the land that usually always has something to do with food production or food foraging because that, essentially, is how our ancestors spent their entire day was in the pursuit of food. so when we are on the land we quickly begin to reconnect with all of those - the linguistic sort of metaphors and references that are all on the land in our local ecosystem. so linguistically our indigenous languages they were emergent from our local ecosystems and from that life of food culture on the land.  SPEAKER: ok so we\\'re gonna speak about language for a second. what is being on the land mean to you? or what\\'s the definition of that term as you\\'re using it?  SPEAKER: yeah well that too is dynamic and huge. i mean, being on the land - in a modern sense?  SPEAKER: yeah.  SPEAKER: well just in the modern sense, i mean, making a conscious effort to be out on the land as and then to redesign our lives on a daily practice. where does our food come from? how do we value natural landscapes? are we able to design our school schedules and curriculum in order to help support being on the land - being immersed on a regular basis so we nurture sort of ecological literacy in our children? as indigenous people, i mean, our relationship with the land is inseparable and we don\\'t have temples. our spiritual interaction is so tied with what we\\'d call our spiritual grandfathers or grandmothers. the spiritual entities that are actually, they reside in the physical landscape. whether it be the rocks, the soil, the grasses, the plant medicine, the trees. we recognize that these have spiritual consciousness and by immersing ourselves in it, we are able to gain contact and to actually have a reciprocal relationship of communication with that landscape.     SPEAKER: well i think that of course, it\\'s therapeutic. it\\'s essential to our long-term well being as a species. i think, though, if we are only to take it in small doses, that\\'s not adequate. it\\'s not adequate for our well being as a species going forward for centuries. i think already our dispossession from the land over the last century is already having such dramatic and devastating consequences on our physical, mental and spiritual REDACTED. so to take half measures of say, \"let\\'s just tweak our daily habits\" or \"tweak our school curriculum\" i don\\'t think that it\\'s going to be enough. i think that we really have to look at making some drastic, systemic change in how we live.  SPEAKER: so being on the land then, there\\'s a volume to it. so it\\'s not just like going outside and being in a green space. it also includes maybe having a portion of your dwelling or as you said this food culture is relating back to the land. so i want to talk to you a little bit since it is therapeutic - now a lot of the work that you do is with, is it just boys or boys and girls where you\\'re actually bringing them back into being on the land. so can you share some of what that - what the process of it and what some of the outcomes you\\'ve witnessed are.  SPEAKER: right. well, for the most part, it\\'s only been with boys. i have done a little bit of work with girls from our local school as well - took some girls the other year on a fishing camp. the reason i work with boys is because there is someone else in the community that specifically works with girls. i guess i have the privilege i guess, in my family, i had a father who was a scholar and a professor but he had also grew up on land very much as a boy and had hunting and fishing skills. that was a very important part of our life growing up. and i have one older brother, he\\'s 9 years older, who also taught me as i was growing to be a boy. and i really took to that. i always felt a deep sense of belonging on the land and on the water. so from a very young age, i thrived in that environment and it was my first priority in life was to make sure that i was spending as much time being on the land and learning about my local environment and the skills that went with that. and then being the youngest in my family i began to have nieces and nephews by the time i was a teenager. and so a lot of my nephews, i began to teach them as well. that was a little over 20 years ago. so yeah, i spent a lot of time, many many trips - hunting trips, fishing trips - with my nephews. and then in the last four or five years here living on the peepeekisis i had the opportunity to begin working with the youth in the community. i took a job as the community wellness coordinator which essentially is kind of the portfolio of a sport and rec, but also drug and alcohol and gang prevention. because of course addiction and gang activity is always a struggle in any community stricken with poverty. so my way of connecting with a lot of the boys who seemed most at risk was to simply approach them and ask them if they wanted to go hunting with me. and of course, they would jump at that opportunity. and as i\\'ve come to learn, 95% of the boys that i worked with didn\\'t have a father figure in their life. so it quickly turned into some very deep relationships that i hadn\\'t envisioned at the onset but i built some relationships with some fabulous young men and, you know, they were labeled as criminals and as drug dealers and vandals and that sort of thing. but they were also very much social leaders. and carried a lot of influence in the community with their peers. and so that circle quickly grew. word got out that phil was the guy who, jump in phil\\'s truck and you\\'d be off on some adventure for the weekend. we\\'d go hunting moose or go fishing for the weekend or something.  SPEAKER: i want you to hear a little bit more of what this is like. so i\\'m gonna play a clip of a radio piece made by  katie sawatzky  who was a journalism student who at the university in regina in saskatchewan canada. this first aired on her school\\'s radio show 2945. katie tagged along with SPEAKER and some of the boys. have a listen:  walking noises SPEAKER: it\\'s taken lots of coaching but the boys are really learning to work as a team because they have to stay in formation. stay even with each other. if somebody falls way behind or someone gets way too far ahead, then the rabbits are a way to cut back and get between them, right? that takes a lot of cooperation. ok. nobody home. off to the next bush. they\\'re like a little pack of wolves coming to the bush here. and that builds belonging amongst them. as indigenous peoples, especially, i mean our ancestors, we\\'ve been here for millennia. we have a deep spiritual relationship with this place. and it\\'s a powerful force in our lives. that\\'s good. just stay about that close to the edge all around. are you going to the middle kiwana? yep. we have an open area. [katie: it\\'s a smaller one.] this gets thick and tangly so it\\'s gonna be tough going in there. move slow tyler. you should move slow because big bill\\'s gonna have to go the fastest because he\\'s there on the outside. in fact, bill you should probably be in the middle and let kiwana be up on top because he\\'s got longer legs and can move quicker. these things matter. especially since we have been forcibly removed from the land for over a century. you know, it\\'s the foundation of all our social crises in our communities. when you can get young people back on the land you begin to just see the ripple effects throughout their life, right? a lot of the negative social habits just disappear. there\\'s one right in between you and me, keep your eyes open, right in between you and me.  SPEAKER: if you want to hear more of katie sawatzky\\'s radio documentary you can connect with her on  twitter at kdokesawatzky  or find her on facebook. i\\'ll also link to her in the show notes. here\\'s more of my conversation with SPEAKER.   for instance, as an example, there was a young man who was known for torturing animals in the community and been known for having killed some cats and some dogs and that sort in the community. and of course, he had been confronted by it. i think he\\'d been in trouble with the law as well. but i befriended him. he was very rough around the edges. but i began taking him out with me. and what i found was that when we took these sort of tough boys that had a hard edge, they were street tough, but they had no experience in the forest. they had no experience in a boat towed in the water. and when you took them out of their comfort zones they became very dependent and they were wide-eyed and very scared. and that then opened them up to receive teaching in order to discuss some of the difficulties in their lives. and it also provided me an opportunity speak about some of our traditional teaching around the responsibility of our relationship with animals. the responsibility as a hunter when taking life. why you take life. when you don\\'t take life. what are the protocols around acknowledging the spirit of that animal? what animals would you not kill? and so the roles and responsibilities around the procurement of food or taking of life of animals is something that this young man really grabbed onto. and i never let him know that i actually knew about his habit of killing animals. i just saw the opportunity. was able to introduce these traditional teachings in a neutral way. he grabbed on to that and he became the boy that was always teaching other boys from then on. he would be one teaching them about how to put tobacco down, how to pray, how to do these things. these kids - they\\'re just starved. they\\'re starved for identity. you know, their identity as indigenous people. what that deep relationship with the land is.  SPEAKER: so you have found essentially community leaders and redirected them essentially back to being on the land and to some success have you seen?  SPEAKER: well yeah i mean it\\'s hard to measure success. i mean you, i run into the issue of just capacity.  SPEAKER: sure.  SPEAKER: i\\'m only one person, one individual. i can only spend so much time with individuals. and that\\'s the challenge, right? of course, when you are dealing with youth who are living in poverty and in crisis you have to be available for them because they\\'re constantly facing challenges day to day that sometimes derail any progress that you\\'re making. but yeah, this plants seeds. you know sometimes even if you don\\'t see results in a year or two years, i mean sometimes it takes many years. but you\\'ve planted a seed in somebody. they might have a hard road to walk for a while but when you introduce young people to a relationship with the land i think that\\'s something they never will forget and maybe at some point in their life they\\'re going to come back to it.  SPEAKER: i\\'m sort of laughing at my question. i have to apologize for my questions about... it\\'s just such a .. my cultural and way that i\\'ve been trained to see the world. \"tell me about the successes.\" the fact that you were out there was a success. so again, i can just hear myself. that is such, that is my cultural bias - to not only value the moment by moment but tell me about ... tell me about the mass application of the things. that was just SPEAKER REDACTED acknowledge problematic potentially element in her own way of seeing things. so thank you for so graciously responding to my cultural bias there.  SPEAKER: we\\'ve all been hardwired to looking for results, right.  SPEAKER: yes. thank you for being with me in that moment. i appreciate that.  SPEAKER: all right.  SPEAKER: anyway, i\\'m just trying to think of so many different directions i can go. so you have a young child, right? is he five?  SPEAKER: he\\'ll be 6 on the 19th. a few days.  SPEAKER: that\\'s just a few days after my son\\'s. they\\'re really close birthday. but we were talking about, i\\'m not sure if your son attended, but that there were some... we have a local nature school here but you said that there was a cree? cree-school where they were creating a way of introducing early language but recognizing that all the language is essentially centered - it\\'s all nature-based language, right? because what else is there if you\\'re a natured based people.  SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: with the axis of your culture being food, it\\'s all going to be related to things that you eat and have to move through. so what would you like to see happen with that way of preserving language and also simultaneously relationship with identity and landscape?   but anyway, around school curriculum. you have some first nations from canada who have had the ability to develop their own curriculum and implement their own curriculum in their schools just because they\\'ve had means and they\\'ve had the capacity in their communities to do so. i mean if as a first nation in canada, if we draft our own laws, we have that right, as sovereign, indigenous nations. but if we don\\'t, then federal or provincial laws will take precedence. and what we\\'re having now is you\\'re having a big push by both the federal government and provincial governments to eliminate that opportunity for first nations to draft their own legal frameworks and develop their own school curriculum and just bring us under the umbrella of the provincial school system and curriculum. which, for myself, is horrific. because it\\'s so, the provincial system is so rigid and academically centric. and so for indigenous communities, our needs are so fundamentally different than the mainstream society where we\\'re trying to recover or reclaim culture. so our educational needs are different. and yeah, making that link between language and land-based education and food education, i think, is vitally important. a lot of people, even in our own communities, they\\'re not making that link yet. i\\'m making these links because i\\'ve been involved in different aspects of that. i\\'ve been involved with language reclamation and i\\'ve been involved in food sovereignty but these two aren\\'t talking to each other. and i\\'ve really beginning to connect these dots and saying, \"we need to stop putting these in silos. it\\'s holistic. they have to go together.\" and we are seeing some - there are others who have observed that and are actually implementing that in their communities. i know in neighboring province of northern manitoba, they\\'ve been really moving forward with food sovereignty initiatives - at first because of the expense of food in the north that has to be flown into these fly-in communities. so they\\'ve begun to get gardening programs, building greenhouses, bringing up all sort of new sorts of innovative little farming practices. they\\'re raising chickens and all these sorts of things that have never been done way up in the north before. and they\\'re seeing great success with it. it\\'s being also connected with language where they, too, were beginning to see the loss of language in the younger generations. so in this one community, they had language gardens. and so they had a huge garden at their school and the older ladies of the community who all could speak the language fluently, they were the ones who were also still had gardening skills. so they were running the garden and the students would come out and when it was that class\\' turn to work in the garden it was cree class time and it was total cree immersion in the garden. you talk about results. monitoring results - the retention rate in language just went through the roof as compared to be in the classroom trying to learn cree.  SPEAKER: language gardens. what a beautiful solution. i love that.  SPEAKER: yeah. and also with natural movement. gettin\\' our fingers dirty.  SPEAKER: that\\'s all it is, yeah. exactly and just being outside is natural movement. it\\'s kind of been reduced to sprinting and throwing rocks and squatting but it really is all of the interactions with all that is in the natural world. and that just includes standing outside in a breeze. you know, that\\'s definitely also natural movement. so i remember we were talking a while ago when we were together and you had noted that your personal family has practices that kind of make you an outlier within your own community. like you don\\'t have a tv in your home, for example. how, and as far as even hunting goes. are you an outlier within your own community because of the extent to which you are comfortable being on the land or have you noticed a change? how do you feel, i guess, having this knowledge or this understanding and wanting to expand it? how do you feel relative to the rest of your community?  SPEAKER: right. well, i think i live a life of obscurity no matter where i go. i\\'m a little bit of a different creature than the peers i grew up with. but, yeah, you know, in the reality of a lot of first nations communities, and it varies widely. i mean a lot of first nations communities do have a very much of a homogeneous identity and a lot of cultural, traditional ways do survive. for others, you can go down the road to a different community and it\\'s going to be drastically different. and that\\'s very much in the instance of my community. i think the effects of colonialism, competing churches and religious institutions and then also the influence of the television and pop culture has pulled our people in so many different directions into such different states of consciousness. and so it\\'s very difficult to bring our community together and have, and share a lot of commonalities that were there just two generations ago. our grandparents. our grandparents had a robust food culture in the community. everybody was growing good food up until the 1970s. you know, people had social relationships built around helping one another whether it was canning food, hunting together, fishing together. we used to have a lot of fishing happened in our community. up until maybe 1980, but then our local lakes have become so polluted due to agricultural runoff and also raw sewage being released by surrounding cities into our water system. so we\\'ve lost a lot of that due to that. but yeah, i mean, a lot of the other fellows who are hunters here in our community, they might hunt, but they\\'re not hunting for the same reasons that i might be hunting. i see a lot of them might have adopted sort of americana version of hunting. trophy hunting. you know, looking for the big buck.  SPEAKER: mm-hmm.  SPEAKER: they watch the hunting channel and this is where they\\'ve learned their hunting skills and implemented them. because we kind of had a lost generation there. and i think a lot of in my father\\'s generation it really hit rock bottom where nobody, really nobody was keeping that alive and well. and so in our generation, you see people getting back into it but some of them aren\\'t getting back into it for the same reason. and for me, they\\'re fundamentally different. they\\'re very different. and they encourage a very different worldview.    SPEAKER: right. yeah, well i mean it gets into discussions around privilege, sustainability, does the natural world, is it able to provide for humanity as we now head towards 8 billion people. yeah, i mean i don\\'t have the solutions for all of humanity...  SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: ...and i always think of ecosystems. the planet was a huge and diverse planet with so many different ecosystems. and the culture, the human cultures reflected that. the diversity in human cultures reflected that. and the big elephant in the room is monoculture. whether it\\'s mono-crops or it\\'s the melting pot of monoculture in humanity. i know that so many see that as an honorable pursuit but myself, i\\'m very leery of that. i see great danger in pursuing mono-culture. diversity is key to resilience as human beings. so i think there\\'s many different answers for different peoples where they are. and solutions going forward are going to be very diverse. you know, where i live, no present day, the province of saskatchewan, i mean, you know, we\\'re a massive - we\\'re the size of california, oregon, and washington put together. and there\\'s only 1 million people there - or here in that massive space. and we have 2/3 of that is boreal forest. so we do have a different reality than say those people living in california as far as how much our natural systems can carry us forward. so i think for myself as an indigenous person, though, and this is something that gets lost and i think a lot of conversations when it comes around protecting land, you know, something people should be familiar with is the un declaration of the rights of indigenous peoples. when it comes around who has first right of access to maintaining a land-based lifestyle - they\\'re hunting and gathering - i don\\'t see the capacity for everybody and it\\'s not a reality for everybody to live that lifestyle. but as indigenous peoples, we certainly have a right. here in canada we certainly do have that right to hunt, to fish, to gather, year round. we don\\'t have to adhere by hunting seasons. but of course that\\'s always under threat and there\\'s always pressure from mainstream society to eliminate that. and i think there is always this pressure to assimilate. to do away with our way of life. which essentially is genocide. that\\'s cultural genocide.  SPEAKER: mm-hmm.  SPEAKER: if you want to do away with that land-based lifestyle you essentially are you\\'re reducing our cultural practices just down to very shadow spectacles of entertainment. you know, dressing up and dancing at a pow wow. but it really has no spiritual or ecological substance. and if we remove ourselves as indigenous peoples from our actual ecological function - we are key species on this continent. just like the bison were. the bison and indigenous peoples were a part of the reciprocal relationship that actually made grasslands REDACTEDy here on the plains. with both indigenous peoples and the bison being removed. you know, we find ourselves, society finds itself searching for all sorts of ways to maintain grassland REDACTED but - cattle and rotational grazing and these sorts of things. but i think that when you remove indigenous peoples from the ecosystems that they emerged from, it\\'s inevitable that that ecosystem will collapse and so will that indigenous human culture. it will collapse. so it\\'s very important that we try to bring those connections back together for the betterment of all of u really.  SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: maybe i went off topic there.  SPEAKER: no i don\\'t think so. i don\\'t think it\\'s off topic. i think that what happens is these are super complex issues and we\\'re so used to talking about food over here and language over here and human rights over here and ecology over here and it\\'s become so parsed that we kind of forget that it\\'s - there\\'s just one system.  SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: just one thing happening with so many moving parts that it\\'s so complicated that the tendency is just to think of global solutions. you know? and to recognize the wholeness of it, of something, is also dependent on the wholeness of each of the parts. and that\\'s i guess what i most appreciate about your answer. so no, it wasn\\'t off topic at all. is this idea again that there\\'s an idea that equality would mean the single solution for everyone to have exactly the same thing throughout the globe and what i hear you expressing, i believe, not to put words in your mouth, would be that the needs are local to the ecosystems and you can define local, i guess, at lots of different levels. it\\'s that complicated. to keep thinking about it. and i also think it\\'s really just to tie into what you said now to what you said earlier this idea that language is springing forth culture is springing forth from a local ecosystem that this diversity that you see throughout the world includes the language and the cultures and the landscapes and the way that people interact with the landscapes that it\\'s all tied together. and that preservation of culture indeed requires preservation of the relationships that caused it to express, perhaps.  SPEAKER: mm-hmm.  SPEAKER: it reminds me of another conversation. seems like we had a lot of conversations when we were together. we were talking about tobacco. so you were talking about not wanting to reduce a culture to maybe the symbolic, like the symbols of a culture, but the behaviors. and you were talking about tobacco. and of course i am interested in - my personal practices include 30 and 40-mile walks. you know, like these things where i feel like this is how i relate to my landscape is to physically walk across it. and you were talking about i guess the spiritual practice of exchanging tobacco but it being relating to the work that one had to do to gather it. if you could share some of that, i think that would help solidify for people listening who, i would say the bulk of our listeners are not indigenous peoples. and the idea of what is a spiritual practice? i mean everyone has their own spiritual practices. let\\'s talk about tobacco. what is that relationship with tobacco, the exchange of it, what does all of it entail? you know, in a few minutes.  SPEAKER: right sure. well you know you have diversity with different linguistic indigenous groups throughout north america but i think the bulk, the majority of us, we do all have a common relationship with tobacco or some sort of form of tobacco. here on the northern plains, we didn\\'t actually use a tobacco plant. we never had a tobacco plant but we made a tobacco - a smoking blend used in our pipes. and we would use, we would call it kinnikinnick - which is bearberry, the bearberry leaf. and then that would be sort of the base and then the inner bark of the red willow tree and then other plant medicines added to that. so the procurement of that was very labor intensive. and it would also involve travel and sometimes trade. in some instances - and you would see variety too, depending on where you are. you know, how far north you are - you would see diversity in that tobacco blend depending on people\\'s surrounding flora and fauna right? but yeah, tobacco is always the center trade item but when i say trade item i mean when in buying, purchasing anything from - in a modern sense if i was to go to an elder and i want to learn a song, a traditional song, i would first and foremost use tobacco. tobacco has to be offered. and the amount, now has changed. because now you buy a packet of cigarettes or a packet of a pouch of tobacco. but traditional it would just be enough to fill the bowl of a pipe because that interaction that you would share with one another would begin, would commence with a pipe ceremony. so that tobacco would be offered for the prayer to commence that interaction. so tobacco is a very sacred tool that we use. but i\\'ve been interested in exploring what is lost in that process that we had traditionally in procuring that tobacco. the amount of walking that went into it. and as indigenous peoples, whenever we are on the land doing something whether it\\'s hunting, whether it\\'s picking medicines, there is also a massive amount of oral knowledge that goes along with it. there is creation stories that go along with that activity. there\\'s songs that go with that activity. there are specific prayers that go with that activity. so when we remove ourselves from that actual land-based lifestyle - of gathering - the knowledge and the stories and the songs begin to fall away as well. and when i talk to giving value to something, giving spiritual power and value to that handful of tobacco it would have been infused with that power through the labor that that person might do to gather it and through the songs and prayers that they had infused into that tobacco. so when it arrived at its destination it had great value. where now today, you know, so many people, we just look to convenience. and we only see the surface of things. we don\\'t put any deep thought into, or action into the procurement of the items in this convenience culture. you run to the corner store and get a pack of cigarettes and go see an elder and say \"ok can i get this song from you?\" so much has been lost in that. right? and i think we sell ourselves short to just say we can exchange one for the other. they\\'re fundamentally different.  SPEAKER: yeah, it\\'s a difference between a vitamin c tablet and an orange.  SPEAKER: yeah. sure. yeah. you need the fiber, right? and you need the substance.   SPEAKER: and maybe even the work to pick it or the knowledge of how to plant it.  SPEAKER: and this is how it gets back to natural movement right? the consequence of this is we see it affecting our bodies. the obesity epidemic in first nations communities is astronomical. and diabetes. early onset diabetes in our children. in fact, i think our stat here, children born in the year 2000, they\\'re now becoming young adults, 18 years old, 2 out of 3 are expected to have diabetes before the age of 40. you know an example of this too, i took a group of boys, grade 5, 10 and 11-year old boys. i had nine of them. i took them out on a trap line snaring rabbits. four out of the nine were too obese to even walk for more than 4 or 5 minutes in the snow over the deadfall and simply had to return back to the van. this is the reality of our people. this is the reality and this is the effect of being disposed from a land-based lifestyle.  SPEAKER: yes. it\\'s interesting, you know, in the realms in which i work there\\'s a resonating idea that movement and land-based practices, although i\\'m not sure that you would read that terminology are in our dna, and then, of course, when you\\'ve had people removed from the land for a longer period of time - hundreds and thousands of years - you kind of adapt to not needing those inputs as much as a culture like yours, so recently removed from the land. i think that was maybe one of the first conversations that we had - where the consequences are so much...they\\'re so different for populations being forcefully, actively, displaced. and i\\'m trying to point out convenience and sedentarism and the relationship of that. and at first glance, it\\'s because of REDACTED. we can talk about things like diabetes and survival statistics but ultimately i\\'m very interested in movement ecology and what happens when you have masses of people becoming sedentary - how does that relate to cultural diversity? how does my belief that i have entitlement, privilege of sedentarism, ultimately start encroaching on others. these are more complex questions, but it really is my personal evolution and my relationship to movement for my personal REDACTED to the REDACTED and well being of others. and that\\'s really only a commentary to maybe for the listeners to tie in so much of my work to maybe some of the things that you are speaking of. your things that you\\'re speaking of alone are super important. they\\'re of such greater importance than i would say the way my knees and my hips feel but just to kind of give people a sense of sedentarism and a lack of being able to move in a natural world is, i think, a really so much more important thing than our personal REDACTED. you know what i mean? i guess if that makes sense.  SPEAKER: you bet. i say it\\'s always - in our traditional teachings, you know, never be human-centric.  SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: western society is all about human centricity. when we talk about climate change or we talk about how is this gonna affect ... i always see people saying the same things: how is this going to affect human being? well, we have to stop just thinking about human beings. we have to think about the planet holistically. all life. life systems. and that, of course, comes back to us. but in our teachings, we put human beings at the bottom. and we have something called wahkohtowin. wahkotowin is a loose translation is kinship. but it\\'s actually - there\\'s a lot of complex protocols. wahkohtowin kind of governs family and tribal relationships between people but it also recognizes our relationships with all of our life relatives: all of the animal world. the plant world. the medicine world. everything. we\\'re recognizing the ecosystem that you live in and how it functions - observing how it functions. understanding the roles and relationships between all different life forms in that ecosystem. figuring out where do we fit in. what role do we play in the REDACTED and well being of the function of that ecosystem and therefore we acclimate to its care and capacity? that\\'s the definition of an indigenous culture. that\\'s indigenous people. and so as we would enter and migrate into a new territory, we would be very highly observant of that care and capacity and the relationships with it and always place ourselves at the bottom and say, as long as we respect and take care of this ecosystem\\'s natural function, it will always take care of us forever going forward. that\\'s sustainability. where you take the human-centric western worldview of dominance to put something under the plow and to essentially obliterate an ecosystem for human consumption needs - so we see this now where the grasslands of north america, 90% of it has been turned into mono-crops that are sprayed with insecticides.   SPEAKER: right.  SPEAKER: what has been lost in that, it\\'s been absolutely devastating. it\\'s ongoing devastation to human cultures and to the function of - what did those natural grasslands, what was their role in carbon sequestration and everything else - in the function of the planet? so we always have to look bigger than our own needs.  SPEAKER: yeah. and our own desires. personal preferences.  SPEAKER: well yeah. you bet. yeah.  SPEAKER: so here\\'s my question. my last question for you is, how is your work, what you\\'d like to accomplish, what you and your community require, how is that best supported by non-indigenous folks?  SPEAKER: well there again, diversity is key, right? get to know indigenous peoples in whatever territory you\\'re living in. their needs on the coast where you are are gonna be very different than the needs of my community. that\\'s the first rule, i guess. and then also the importance of not being rescuers. not being - coming into an indigenous community and saying \"hey i can see what you guys problem is and i know how to fix it.\" we\\'ve had that for a century. and it always falls flat. i think that there\\'s a lot of very smart young indigenous people in communities all across north america. they know what they need. but they\\'re lacking the means. as we know, most of the wealth in the u.s. and canada is in the hands of non-indigenous, not people of color still hold that power. and wealth. and so just supporting what other initiatives that are already happening i think is important.  SPEAKER: do you have a couple good examples? i mean we can put them in the show notes and point people to great indigenous lead, local community or even larger scale climate work?  SPEAKER: i think climate work is really important and i think anybody who is doing food sovereignty. i mean there\\'s all kinds of food sovereignty... like i was saying - that\\'s the core. that\\'s the core. everything else when you\\'re putting food sovereignty and issues back together that begins to heal the social fabric of a community. that brings back the language. that brings back economic prosperity. that beings to heal all of that that\\'s been frayed. and so, for myself, that\\'s where i see the most focus is needed, in those food sovereignty initiatives and i bet you in the u.s., every reservation is going to have a fairly good-sized community of people very conscious of that and moving forward with that. i know there\\'s a lot of conferences even more so in the u.s. than there is in canada around food sovereignty. in fact, i think there\\'s one in your area very soon coming up.  SPEAKER: there is, in seattle.  SPEAKER: in seattle, right. and i think there\\'s another one in iowa and another one in sioux falls south dakota. so yeah, i think that\\'s a really good thing to be supporting. here for myself locally, i\\'ve partnered with the nature conservancy of canada. we\\'ve had the whole truth and reconciliation process happening. it\\'s very controversial - all stemming from the residential schools but we had the truth and reconciliation commission come out with 94 recommendations for both government and ngo organizations to take on in a healing process going forward for indigenous peoples in this country. i couldn\\'t list them all. you can google it.  trc recommendations . but different organizations might be able to say, adopt one or two. and so the nature conservancy of canada because they have land, here in saskatchewan they have, i believe, 150 thousand acres of natural prairie. they said well how do we, what role has the dispossession from the land - what role has that played in indigenous communities so how can we be of service. so going forward i\\'ll be working with them doing some contract work, exploring some land-based education opportunities. getting first nation schools/kids out onto natural prairie. they have buffalo, they have some massive buffalo herds in some of their bigger properties in the south of the province and they want to do partnerships with indigenous communities with raising buffalo. they also want to do food sovereignty initiatives. really explore - right now we\\'re in very early days of exploring what all can we do. and over the next year i\\'ll probably be going out to communities throughout the province, first nations communities, on behalf of the ncc letting some of our people know about the ncc and what sort of work they are able to do but they\\'re also taking that approach of letting first nations persons like myself - let\\'s go to communities. let\\'s see what they can do. how can they be of support? they\\'re not prescribing a solution themselves. they\\'re just saying hey, we have land, how can it be of use.  SPEAKER: well thank you for all of that. those are many many action items so i appreciate that. and i also appreciate you taking your time from your much more important work than being on my podcast to come and share your perspective and inform many. hopefully it will trickle back, ultimately, to the work that you\\'re trying to accomplish. so i just want to say that i\\'m grateful that you have come on and i think you for all the work that you\\'re doing.  SPEAKER: yeah, well i\\'m very honored. and it\\'s all very important work. thank you very much.

I’ll include the blog links, and you go tuck that kid in. KATY: I will. Thank you so much. DANI: Take one yourself. KATY: Yeah. I will. DANI: All right. KATY: All right, thanks, Dani. DANI: Have a good day, bye. KATY: Bye. DANI: Okay, so we were hijacked – or shall I say, carjacked by an adorable sounding, speed-driving 2 year old on Katy’s end, and some antsy kids letting a scrabbling Chihuahua into my office on my end, so it was a good time to end the show. I will put the link to “Un-Pimp My'], 'KATY': ['Oh! Let the puns – let the puns –', 'So first, I think – this something they might not have known before. As you look at your gas gauge, there is a triangle next to the picture of a gas tank which tells you which side your gas tank is on. Did you know that?', 'Shut up!', 'I did not know that until, like, this year! And to me, that is the most important thing that everyone should know about their car.', 'Well, I guess I travel a lot and I am constantly in rental cars, and so I just wanted to – that’s all I wanted to share today. Just kidding. Okay. In  Move Your DNA,  I talk about how it’s not always about sitting less, it’s about sitting differently. So if you feel trapped in your car life, right now, that you feel like you can’t reduce it at all or do anything with it, you can always do it differently, so that you’re not begetting the same shape of your body over and over again. So that’s what those posts are about. So a couple things: do you think anyone’s listening to this while they’re driving?', '', 'Their left leg is not pushing on anything, and is usually flexed at the knee and the hip. I’m doing this with my hands right now. So your right arm – well, my right arm right now because I’m doing this in the air, which is your leg – it’s all the way reaching, your toes are pointed probably as well, while at the same time you’re doing the opposite with your other leg. And that doesn’t just load the legs in a particular way; you’re loading your pelvis. You’re loading the right and left halves of your pelvis differently. You’re creating this torque where one half of your pelvis is rotating forward and the other half of your pelvis is rotating backwards. Are you with me on that one?', 'So stop pulling your left leg back. Even though your left leg doesn’t have to do anything, there is a little pedal that most cars have on the left side of the pedals that is just a foot rest that you can keep your left foot on. It’s really hard to do, because you’ll reach your left foot out there and then over time all of a sudden you’ll notice, oh, my left leg came back to this flexed and bent up position. So that’s something that you can work on is at least extending and pressing through both legs.', 'Yeah, I mean, it’s certainly not helpful, and since most adults drive and have been driving since their teenage years, which are still your bone-setting years, then, yeah. I think it’s something that we spend quite a bit of time doing – quite a bit more time doing than any sort of corrective exercise to undo it.', 'Okay, so the second thing, though, too, so in addition – and I haven’t been able to figure out how not to do this – when I push the gas pedal down, the way my leg reaches the gas pedal – so a lot of times, I don’t know if there’s solutions to a lot of these things, there’s just a lot of questions that I get and probably you get, too, are “what’s making this?” and you think about it in terms of when you’re moving, it’s like, okay, I’m going to make my workout more symmetrical and the way that I’m walking more symmetrical, but then there’s these huge heaps of time we spend doing this thing that is loading the body. And one of the things that I do when I push the gas pedal with my right foot, I clench my toes. And I can’t stop because the way that my foot – the way that my leg is already reaching, the way I can get my foot to the gas pedal is by plantar flexing or pointing my toe, but I still don’t have enough – I don’t have the lever length. My toes have to become part of this lever, so I scrunch my toes, too, at the same time. And to keep my toes relaxed is to fatigue another muscle, so I play with the distance of my seat a little bit to see if I can get that toe clenching to relax. So if you’re dealing with, like toe contractures or hammertoes, you know, that toe scrunching in addition to keeping your shoes on your foot if you’re wearing flip flops or like a slide-on shoe are you gripping the gas pedal? So I really pay attention to movement with a lot of different things that I do, and driving is something that I don’t have to do very much of anymore luckily. But for those of you out there who still are, you can pay attention to your toes so that the tips, knees, and toes and then the worst thing about the car, for me, is that every single car seems to be a bucket seat now.', 'What are your –', 'It’s interesting. You can’t even get a car that doesn’t have bucket seats anymore. Our culture has shaped our bodies, which is now shaping the furniture, which is shaping the next generation of culture, right? Like, your kids are just – they just, they’re not standing a chance, they’re just bucketed out. There’s just buckets everywhere. De-bucketing the seat of your car, and what I do is I take a towel and I fill in the back of my car – the back of my car seat so that the part that you sit on, the bench part, is as horizontal as possible. So a lot of people will say, well, that’s what I use a lumbar pillow for; I’ll put the lumbar pillow – they’ll put it on the vertical part –', 'of the seat. Thank you. The non-vertical part. The backrest. They’ll put it on the backrest trying to prop their lumbar spine up. The only difference in doing that is that the loads are different. I wrote about this – I believe I put it in the  Don’t Just Sit There  e-book about office, because car drives & commutes are part of office life for a lot of people. So I was talking about: we have this notion of this spinal alignment we want to maintain, and so a lot of people will force themselves into a neutral pelvis, meaning that they’ve tipped their pelvis forward, but they’re essentially doing it uphill because they’re in a bucket. So while the position might be “neutral” the loads are not, meaning that you’re actively having to fire the extensors in your spine to get that to happen, and that’s not what alignment is. Alignment is that both the position and the forces and the loads are “neutral,” or what they’re supposed to be. So you don’t want to have a lumbar pillow shoving you uphill where the tendency is still passively rolling back down. You just want to get rid of the force that’s rolling you backwards. So for me, well – I don’t know if it’s for me – like, just fill in the seat. Take your lumbar pillow and put it on the seat and sit on it to kind of promote a roll forward, if you will.', 'It’s not on the backrest; the towel is on the seat.', 'The towel is on the seat, and all I’m doing is filling the hole. So if it’s a bucket, you can get it to stop being a bucket by filling up the void of the bucket. So I just – and there’s a picture of this on “Un-pimp Your', '-- There’s no more downhill roll for me anymore.', 'It’s cheap. It’s cheap, it’s fast, and it’s a great way if you’re logging a lot of miles to instantly change the loads to your low back and your pelvis and your tailbone, and really your abdomen, too.', 'In the middle. But it’s not just your arms that are doing this position. Your whole rib cage is sliding, so to not is to take out that right to left slide. Or if you rest your arm – my grandpa used to drive around – he was a cowboy – with his arm in the window – and he would drive with his right hand, and so he had a rib slide to the left. So just notice if you habitually assume some position that then promotes a tension, which then promotes a bone shape, or displacement, just based on the loads that you assume on a regular basis while you’re driving in the car. So watch your right to left shift, and then also your rib thrust. If you’re rib dropping, then you can use the back of the seat to drop your ribs back towards – depending on how vertical your seat is – so I will roll my seat all the way up to make it as vertical as possible. If I didn’t fill my bucket, that might be very uncomfortable because then I would be in a hyper flexed position, but because I filled my bucket, basically I’m trying to make my seat look like an “L,” like the letter L, and then I sit in it.', 'I probably do. Didn’t Mister Bean drive like a Mini?', 'Well, he’s Mister Bean. He’s just very proper and very (clears throat) and doing his little thing. So yeah, I’m definitely perched. I’m definitely working while I’m seated. I don’t look like – I don’t look like I’m yielding to the chair where the chair is supporting me. I’m definitely doing work while I’m getting from Point A to Point B in a car, which is, again, not very often.', 'There could be. There could be a low rider theme song playing, but I am not – I am not emanating the low rider. Is that right?', 'What about hydraulics?', 'I did – well, I came from a town where everyone bounced.', 'So yeah, yeah.', 'Yeah. It’s almost as tough as deciphering all of Tim’s acronyms. He is sometimes able to speak in acronyms and I’m like, “I don’t know what you’re saying!”', 'He is. BOTNL. So yeah, ramping your head up, definitely, on the computer screen don’t let your face drip towards your computer screen and you shouldn’t let your face drip towards the steering wheel, either. Just slide your chin back, make sure that your ribs aren’t coming up with you, and then, you know, it’s like 10 and 2 is the safest position for driving, but I, for myself, will kind of play with different hand holds a little bit just to load my shoulders and my hands differently.', 'You hear people? Who’s this? Did you want to make a surprise appearance on my podcast? Come on up! She’s got to take off her boots first.', 'She’s actually – you know, here’s the thing. I just watched her on her father’s lap drive into the driveway. So she absolutely is driving today, she just drove here right now.', 'What was that? Was that an acronym?', 'Ohhh, well, see, Tim also speaks French so it’s hard for me to tell the difference.', 'Did you say it in English?', 'How do you say it again?', 'Quelle coincidence.', 'Les mon Cherie…', 'Oh!

So lots of different connection systems, I guess, if you will.', 'Maybe, I mean, yeah. That’s one of the –', 'Well, who knows what they’re  for , but I think – we talk about natural movement and in  Move Your DNA  I get into this idea that you’re not moving naturally, as well as your parts aren’t moving naturally. So what are the motions – what are the loads to the breasts? What are the natural loads to the breasts? And that would be feeling their own weight, that’s one of them.', 'Well, so there’s – it’s kind of interesting when you talk about the weight of something, because that’s always from a standing still perspective. So they’re under their weight when you’re standing still, but also it’s natural for them to be moving around as you are, so the more movement you do, the more natural it would be for the breast to come with you, right? So bending over, standing up, dancing.', 'Right now I’m just talking about the breast in its natural form, so not with anything.', '(growls) Yes.', 'I’m surprised there’s not more of that, like the breasts galloping across the opening of  National Geographic.  Or Omaha – is it Mutual Omaha?', 'Yes! Oh my gosh, that’s a total flashback.', 'Right. Or breast leopards. And leopards’ breasts. Um, so, anyway. Movement – you are movement. Moving. But then you’ve got musculature underneath the breast, so the movement of that musculature also moves the breast, or doesn’t, depending on how much that musculature moves. In general, you can think about the musculature from the sternum moving – you know, which is where your necklace hangs, or the breastplate. I’m trying to think of more layman’s terms for it. It’s the sternum, but if you find where a necklace would hang, or a chain, you find that notch and you travel all the way down to the bottom of the sternum, there’s the tip, that xyphoid process. So if you trace from that sternum out to that shoulder, attaching to your humeri – your humerus on one arm, the upper arm bone – so there’s this musculature that’s going between there. So that muscle underneath, as it’s doing its job contracting, releasing, it’s moving the tissue that’s on top of it. And I pull that out a little bit because when you think of movement, you think of big muscles – arms, boobs – but I’m thinking more of the cellular movement. You know, what is the cell’s experience? So let’s say your pectoralis – your chest muscles – are doing. What they’re doing, they’re pushing and pulling on your breasts as well. And then breastfeeding is an – there’s a movement there, as is – so milk production. I separate between the two. So there’s making milk, you know, there’s milk being produced and coming out and moving out, but then there’s also the loads to the nipple. So the baby’s busy doing something there.', 'I mean, yeah, there’s that, too. That’s not always that fun, but it’s there, it’s happening. There’s the mouth kneading – you know, the funniest thing I saw was there used to be a horse on a local ranch of puppies – we’d call it the horse puppy. And when it wants milk, there’s cows kind of by us, too – they whack their head into –', 'I’m trying to think – the udder?', 'And there’s a teat.', 'So I was just corrected on this one time in class by a veterinarian, and she said the udder is actually the sack, and the teats are the things that you grab. You grab a teat, milk the teats. And so it was whacking the udder, just like whaling on it, so then I didn’t feel so bad about my kids mangling my breasts.', 'Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so there’s that. There’s also temperature, right? So there’s a response to temperature or excitement, which all tends to look like the same response. So these are natural loads, and if you think about them, how many of these natural loads have you experienced over a lifetime? It might be reduced by your temperature controlled environment, clothing, bras that are minimizing those types of movement. But then I like to say, too, that the weight of your breast is probably not the natural weight of your breast.', 'Well, it’s when you’re talking about natural movement and how things occurred in nature, the weight of people’s breasts might not be the same natural weight of their breast were they eating a natural diet, right? So – it becomes important later on when we’re talking about, should I shuck my bra? I think it’s actually ‘chuck’ my bra, not ‘shuck’ my bra. It’s not corn, sorry. So should I chuck my bra or not, because I want to go natural? And it’s like there’s lots of components of natural. Again, so when I say a breast under its own weight I’m talking about its natural weight.', 'It might be more, but that’s all I can think about right now.', 'Yeah', 'Temperature.', 'Or excitement.', 'I mean, it’s a response. You respond in all sorts of ways – you move, you’re moving all sorts of different ways besides just what you do for exercise. So we’re talking about arrector pili, the horripilation, another word for goose bumps. Millions of muscles all over your body, and the same thing – parts of your breast are similar in that way, that they respond to temperature by shifting shape. It’s movement, baby.', 'Or has experienced. It has experienced in its natural state for a long time.', 'Non-wild life?', 'Well, it’s – I think you could probably look at the list that I just gave and you could come up with the things, the person listening –', '-- Millions of people listening to this podcast right now could come up with the things that they’re doing that are undermining or removing the natural loads. So yes, there are – there’s non-natural loads but then there’s also introduction of unnatural loads. So I talked about bras, right? So bras, lifting or pressing – there’s also the lack of arm movement in general.', 'Yeah, well, what do you do with your arms the bulk of the time? You’re on your computer, right?', 'What is that position? And then imagine that you had nothing and had to get everything, and imagine what you would be doing with your arms, you know?', 'Yeah, and not even just the position, but the work that you – I mean, you’re pulling things out, you’re lifting things up and down, you’re carrying your kids, you’re digging all day for food. You’re reaching up and clambering to get where you need to go. You’re missing quite a bit, and so as far as the natural environment to your breast, we’re at a seriously compromised environment for sure. And temperature control – I mean, it’s a nice, comfortable temperature here inside these walls, you know. There’s air conditioning on, but most people live in a place where they’re not constantly responding to temperature. We’ll talk about that next in the ball show, you know. In the balls show, that temperature is a big natural load – or the response to temperature is a big, natural load to these parts.', 'It’s right there.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, breast health is larger than the bra. I just think we just think that everything’s a vacuum.', 'And hopefully your breast is not in a vacuum right now, although I shouldn’t judge.', 'That’s right.', 'Yeah.', 'No, and a bra – the idea of a bra, or reducing the support of a bra is a cool place to start, because it doesn’t take any extra time. If you’re talking about how much you use your arms and all that other stuff, that changes a lot. It requires a larger change of your – of the way that you live, but changing your bra is just putting something different on in the morning, or taking something off earlier. It’s not like you have to add any more reps.', 'There’s no more reps.', 'That being said, there’s a lot of people when we get to the questions, I bet there’s a lot of people who are like, there’s no way I could take off my bra. And it’s like, fine. So let’s do these other things. Let’s talk about shoulder health and arm motion, and so it’s – I think that if you can think about your breasts as a part of your shoulder girdle instead of as something, like some sort of frosting on top of your body that’s not related to anything else – you can improve your breast health by improving the environment of where it lives.', 'Breast frosting.', 'Sure.', 'Well, spit it out.', 'I don’t know. I don’t know. Bras aren’t that old – bras are pretty new. Also, you know, again – if we talk about natural or your natural load or the weight of the breast, what if your breast is unnaturally heavy? In which case the breast is providing support. I’m sorry – the bra is providing support, so I think that you can usually find a benefit to something. However, it’s kind of like an orthotic, right? In that case, the bra’s like an orthotic. It’s supporting a structure that’s not functioning “right” – big air quotes around correctly or the word right – but for a lot of people it can bring about relief, but when you look at your relationship with the bra, there’s a chance that you might have slapped it on before you ever needed it. So are we training our breasts to be out of shape? That’s my – that’s my question. People are worried about – the question’s like, it’s going to collapse! We need support!', 'Yeah. You know, that’s so funny. Because we talked before about the pictures that everyone goes to look at in  National Geographic  and I happened to stay over New Year’s at this rustic cabin, and it was stuffed full of  National Geographic .', 'Like a whole room, like hoarder style.', 'Hoarding of  National Geographic  from the ‘50s and ‘60s.', 'I read all of them. That’s how much fun I am on New Year’s Eve.', 'No! I should have done that instead. That would have been a better way to spend my New Year’s Eve.', 'I came across pictures of lots of boobs, and none of them were droopy. So I’m wondering if it’s not a small – if it’s kind of like a cliché, like if there are some pictures of droopy boobs somewhere, because I looked at a lot of boobs on New Year’s Eve. Hordes of breasts, you know, in different – you know, I love  National Geographic .', 'Yeah, I know. So we have our own version of fun.', 'So not to say that they’re not there – I’ve seen those pictures, too. It’s just that everyone goes to this picture and says, I don’t want this – but it’s like, let’s look at lots of breasts, you know? You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all? No, you need to see them all. An old boyfriend told me that. True story.', 'Yeah, so – you have to think about the whole picture. It’s always whole body with me, right? So every time the question’s like, we can talk about boobs, but I’m always going to be talking about whole body again. So I’m just saying that your – the state of your breast has to do with your whole body movement and your diet and what you do all of the time. It’s not really, again, just what’s happening on the front of your chest. And so your suspensory ligaments – like, how are they supposed to work if they never actually get to feel the load of your breast? But maybe your breast is too large, in which case you can downgrade the support. You can slowly – this book, my next book that’s coming out is on transitioning well to minimal footwear. We have this idea that barefoot is natural, so I’ll take off my shoes and run around, but I get injured. There’s this transition period needed. You have to slowly give back the work to the feet. So the same thing, you have to slowly give the work to the tissues that make up the breasts, and you also have to strengthen the muscles that are part of the shoulder support system that are the shoulder girdle. So maybe it’s upper bodywork or hanging for you before you think about ditching the bra.', 'Well, tissue doesn’t endlessly adapt. Tissue doesn’t endlessly adapt. So I do think you can have a breast – I do think you can have an unnaturally – for you – large breast. Not to say that everyone should have the same breast size, it’s just that again – relative to your size – is your breast your natural size, you know? It’s like, what are the factors that influence breast size, and I would – if I could make a mechanical list and then there’s a whole bunch of things I don’t even know to include that are influencing the breast size, how many of those are affected by lifestyle and being in the tank so to speak? Because our breasts are in the tank – it’s a breast tank. It’s a tank full of breasts. Which is the best zoo ever, oh my gosh!', 'See, we need to ditch this podcast thing and open up the breast tank.', 'It’d be on the Greatist list. Top 1 best place to go for New Year’s Eve.', 'The breast tank.', 'I guess it depends on what the tank’s full of.', 'You could take a picture. Ride the breasts for 5 minutes!', 'Well, it’s a bit misleading. It makes me think, like, I –', 'If only you could see what I was doing with this motorboat right now. Sorry. Sorry. Okay, focus. We should not have an audience. We need to not have an audience. We really need to get back to doing this on our own. So anyway, more questions!', 'I wear – typically, when I wear – I wear a bra, a lot of the time. And it’s always a sports bra. I don’t own anything now that’s not a sports bra. I don’t want to have any pushup or underwire bras. So nothing fancy.', 'It’s not.', 'Sporty. It’s sporty.', 'The flow of electrons?', 'I don’t know. I don’t know anything about the flow of electrons based on something being put on the body externally. And as far as the flow of lymphatics, again I don’t know about the flow of lymphatics from external pressures, since it’s an internal system. But if the external device is limiting or changing the loads to the body underneath that, that can be a potential effector of lymphatic function.', 'For me, the way that I see things like lymphatic flow is tied up to – again – the health and the use of your musculo-skeletal system. I don’t see it as really a separate system. So it would fall under, like if you wanted to improve the lymphatics of your breast, you have to improve the musculoskeletal function of your shoulder girdle. Again, it’s not like – the breast’s lymphatic system is dependent on shoulder motion, arm motion, shoulder motion.', 'Right, right. I haven’t worn an underwire bra for years – something tells me the way you said that question, like it’s uncomfortable for some of us, do you wear one ever?', 'So I wonder – is – we should have done some research. We should have been changing bras during this podcast, like the Oscars, they’re changing dresses. The hosts are changing dresses, so we could talk about it. But I wonder if –', 'Well, it’s underwire, you know. It could limit rib cage motion.', 'So if it’s pressing on the rib and then you have muscles underneath the rib that are supposed to be moving the ribs kind of individually, which is part of the lymphatic system. You’ve got a lot of lymph nodes running down the sternum.', 'Well, you know, wire is more pressure. Wire is more pressure.', 'For sure.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, but you know what, comfort means different things to different people. A lot of people are comfortable by the way they look in their clothes, that there’s a discomfort from not looking a certain way. So I don’t want to leave those people out, but if you’re hearing this right now and you’re like, oh my gosh, I want to reduce the unnatural loads to my breast, you could swap out an underwire for something with a little less structure. In which case you’re still feeling supported, or comfortable about appearance, because you know, so much of it is about how it looks for other people’s comfort. You know, maybe you don’t care about how it looks, but.', 'Yeah, that’s separate.', 'We could. But I can’t change the culture – I couldn’t change the culture, but I can help you change your bra.', 'Yeah, do it.', 'Yeah, there’s a transition, right? You’re having to slowly give the loads to your tissues so that they can respond and become stronger. So the easiest thing to do is put your bra on later and take it off sooner – that’s when you’re at home. A lot of people seep in their bra. You can stop sleeping in your bra because the loads are pretty small compared to standing and jogging or whatever else that you’re doing. Work on your shoulder girdle mechanics – again, in  Move Your DNA  there’s that whole swinging/hanging section. You know, get your upper body stronger so that you can change – you know, a lot of people say, “I don’t like the shape of my breast when it’s without my bra.” It’s like, well, what’s the strength of your shoulder girdle look like? Because the shape of your breast will change.', 'That’s huge! It’s huge. That’s a huge thing to do.', 'Yes.', 'Yes. With your bra on or off, your choice.', 'Okay, party pooper. All right. No vacuums in your cubicle? Anyway. So hold your hands behind you; grip your hands behind you and link your fingers behind you, and if you’re sitting and you don’t want to stand up because it’d be too conspicuous that you’re listening to a podcast at work, let your arms fall over your head. So you have to bend forward. You can either just while sitting in your chair let your chest go over the top of your legs and let it come over, or – I’m going to stand up, you can stand up and let it go all the way over – ah, so good.', 'There’s a lot of people in this studio audience on their backs not doing this exercise. It’s weird. It’s even weirder that we’re talking about them like they’re not here.', 'Some. So a lot of people have done this stretch, right? And if you feel like you can’t get to your hands, like my shoulders are so tight –', 'Yeah, my hands are linked behind me like I’m weaving them. Grab a strap or a belt or a scarf or a broom, or anything that lets you get your hands closer together. Then, if you did make it to your hands, though, switch the hand=holding. Hold your hands the uncomfortable way and do it again, because it changes.', 'All right.', 'Yeah! Anyone.', 'Everyone needs a healthier shoulder girdle. DANI: So you could do that and then read the book and get further into other things you can do. I mean, you shouldn’t just go out and hang on monkey bars if you haven’t done – KATY: Yeah, everything’s step-wise. DANI: This is a good first step to do it, and to realize where you’re at with that. And that’s it. That’s it; you’ve got us stretched, and knowing now that the health of your breasts isn’t just nutrition or what you’re putting on them, it’s a whole body thing. It’s the movement that happens and the loads we place on them. So this was fun. KATY: If you found that informative, then look for our next episode, which is the – DANI: The balls show. KATY: The balls show. DANI: So dangly bits for both boys and girls, we cover it all. KATY: And everyone in between. Or we shouldn’t cover it all! Dang it! Dang it! DANI: That’s what we’ll talk about!

      "{'DANI': ['Two weeks ago – oh, it was a little less than two weeks ago, there was an awesome article in the  Toronto Sun  that somebody sent us about New York City’s MTA (Metro Transit Authority.) They’re taking on manspreading.', 'I did not, either. I had an idea; it’s pretty clear. But it is exactly like it sounds. I looked up manspreading and it is exactly what you would think, right?', 'You’re sitting on a public transportation or in a folding chair in a conference or something and, fi you’re a guy, your legs are just kind of sprawled open. You’re letting the boys breathe. That’s manspreading. But I guess if you’re a little old lady on the subway with groceries, then that’s taking up a seat and it’s kind of an issue. So, let’s relate this to our last podcast we did when we talked about breasts. We’re talking about things that hang off us, but it’s from a guy’s perspective now.', 'It’s the balls show.', 'All right. So, we talked about the last show the natural loads that are interfered with when we strap down our sweater puppies, so let’s talk about the loads down there for guys. And since you don’t have a penis, Katy, and I don’t have a penis; we kind of have to rely on the gentlemen around us, the boys around us. I know that you don’t do comment sections, and I typically don’t, either, but I did want to find out what men had to say about this manspreading. Did you go through the comment section of that article in the  Toronto Sun ?', 'All right, well, I did, and I wanted to know what the boys had to say about this whole manspreading thing, and it was funny because women commenting and all said it’s about dominance. But then men themselves – the ones who are doing the spreading and have the testicles and penises – most of them said they just want to air out the equipment. And one guy pretty astutely noted, and I never even thought about this because I don’t have testicles, but he said it takes very little pressure for ones’ testicles to feel uncomfortable. And depending on how far one’s balls hang down, it might be necessary to do the spread just so that you’re not screaming and having tears come out your eyes when you’re sitting down.', 'Boxer puppies. No, but they could call them kerbangers or the hanging brain, or, you know.', 'Junk. Here’s my favorite: man jigglies.', 'And also, I guess testicles matter is what I want to say.', 'They matter.', 'Yeah.', 'Right.', 'Yeah. I started karate and the women, when we kneel, the men are allowed to spread their knees apart. The women are not. And this chagrins me and my daughter to no end because it’s not comfortable to put my knees – you know, it’s just, when you’re kneeling it’s just weird. But, um –', 'Yeah', 'You’ve got to be a lady before you kick somebody. But so testicles matter.', 'Let’s talk about – we know why they matter, but let’s talk about the loads that are created when a guy goes commando. Everybody knows what commando is? That’s –', 'See, that’s cool. Trust me, there are some very unpleasant terms – I’m keeping them off the air.', 'So don’t feel like your nose is all out of joint about this. What happens when we bring tighty-whities or compression shorts when they come into the picture?', 'Well, just move that to a different part of your body. I mean, if you said that, if you put your right arm in a sling for a year, think about –', 'You know, what would happen to that if you could not use that arm? Of course, it would atrophy and all this stuff would happen, so it’s I think fascinating to remind us about the cremaster and what it does. It serves a purpose.', 'It’s good, and because I’m not a guy and I don’t have balls, I get to ask my guy friends these questions, which is a super fun part of my job. And one of the questions – well, when I asked how come you don’t go commando? One of the answers was, “well, I don’t want balls hanging down to my knees.” So it was the same kind of thing as –', 'With women and breasts. It’s – they think they need that support. The other one, and I had thought about this a while back, is just say 300-400 years ago, some guy’s going commando, he’s probably got some nice buckskin pants on instead of Levi’s with a button fly. So we’re talking about the load on – that’s got to feel uncomfortable.', 'Well, there’s just – clothes that are uncomfortable. Pushing on the penis.', 'I mean, underwear provides a measure of protection to our modern clothing crisis.', 'And so I, myself, not having a penis but I go commando a lot, I also get to walk around in yoga pants all the time. I don’t go commando if I’m wearing jeans.', '(singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T', 'And this is hard to find – I mean, nobody’s researching underwear very much, so if anyone has any awesome stuff they could send me about that, I would love that. Et tu. We’re just kind of writing off the whole balls thing; it’s just like, the health of it –', 'Fine. Like, I find all these sites about liberating your breasts, but not one about – there was like the ten commandments of going commando. That’s the best thing I could find, you know, it was more of a cultural thing, so I’m fascinated by this.', 'Nothing. I was very frustrated, and that conversation is good. I mean, people talk about their spleens and their diabetes, so let’s just talk about our pelvic floor issues, too. Why not? It’s just a body part, folks.', 'Balls and boobs, boobs and balls. It’s balls are just a body part.', 'Huge', 'Yeah. And so any male listeners, you want to weigh in on this, please, just email me privately or I just – I’m so curious about this.', 'You’re sharp today.', 'Okay', 'A question: do you –', 'Yeah, I’m just trying to phrase this – so kids going commando, one of the concerned questions about this was desensitizing their penis and that being a bad thing. Like, I was just talking about jeans making it hard for modern man to go commando, right? Because he’s not used to brushing up against anything. I guess I’m just curious, what about, would that happen naturally for a little boy if he’s running around in the wild all the time? Would he have any less sensitivity – I don’t even know what I’m trying to ask.', 'I’m behind that 100%.', 'Ya still got somethin’ rubbin’ up against ya, lass.', 'Ah, Washington. No kilts here.', 'No.', 'And there’s a huge Scottish population, too, but no, no kilts. Not that I’ve seen. I’d like to see a kilt walking down the street.', 'I don’t know about that one. It’s pretty good. So we were just griping that there’s nothing really about ball health out there, something you could do right now. But do you have something that you can offer up right now? You got a ball stretch in your pocket?', 'Let me – I don’t use it, but hold on, I set stuff on it. Okay.', 'Slow lift puts the counter balance on.', 'He’s a pirate. He’s a pirate.', 'Pirates do this. They stand like this all the time.', 'And actually, you’re letting the boys breathe.', 'The boys are breathin’. My girl-boys are breathing. That’s good. This is a good stretch.', 'Yeah, it is doable. I had a question about, you know, manspreading being necessary, but I guess you answered it in the beginning. It’s really just, you should be allowed to be comfortable as long as you’re not keeping somebody who needs a seat from a seat, or invading anybody’s body bubble, you should be comfortable whether you’re a man or a woman.', 'Ooh, that was a good one. There you go with that awesome quote generator again. I like that better than your random number generator, myself.', 'Naw, that was too short. Give me a bigger one!', 'Well done. Asking the gentlemen in my life about underwear because I just had a young man – nameless young man – who switched from boxer briefs to just boxers. Just curious, he wanted to try them. Now he likes them. So I asked, why do you like them? Was it that you got more freedom? And he said a very interesting thing – he said yeah, it’s cooler, but the tension around my thighs is less. And I never even thought about that with different kinds of underwear. Does it have that kind of pressure and load on his leg?', 'So does a man have to worry about having National Geographic balls if he doesn’t wear underwear?', 'Yeah! How come that didn’t show up in the issue?', 'There were never any dangling ball pictures in the library in Lewis & Clark Elementary School. Dangit. That’s a good point, Katy Bowman.', 'It’s good to be free.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, it’s good stuff.', 'It’s a lot to think of. I was going to say it’s a lot to chew on, but we don’t want to go there, so. Well, what are you going to go out and do today?', 'That sounds good. I’d like to go see that someday. KATY: I’m going to hike my leg up and over something. DANI: Yeah! KATY: That’s a good strengthening, right? So you’re in the chair. You’re in this chair, with your leg up, doing your stretch, which I’ve assumed that everyone listening is doing for the last 20 minutes since we talked about it. But from this standing – from this position where your foot is up maybe 2 feet off of the ground, can you – probably not good if it’s on an office chair – but can you press that leg down and stand up onto one leg on the chair? DANI: Wow. I’ll have to go out and try that on a stump in the back yard or something. KATY: Yeah, right? So there is – talking about all of the muscles in that area. Without, you know, you also have to look at how much do you have to really use momentum and use all of the other muscles besides the muscles of the groin and the hamstring of that leg? Because you’ll be able to do it, but it’s about doing it more with a particular region and less with others. So anyway, just something to play with. Something to play with for the balls show. DANI: Oh, as always, that was a pleasure. That was fun. KATY: Love it. Love the dangling shows. DANI: Dangling bits are important. Just as important as all the other bits. KATY: If not more! DANI: Well, thank you very much for your time. KATY: All right, well, have a good one. DANI: I hope you have an awesome day. KATY: Bye. SHOW'], 'KATY': ['I didn’t even know what manspreading was.', 'Yep.', 'It’s the balls show!', 'All right! Bring it.', 'I never read the comment section!', 'So all that – it’s like getting kicked in the balls is just one, large magnitude application of what they’re feeling all day on in their underwear? Not to point out – it’s kind of funny. So the sweater puppies – boobs are sweater puppies, but no man would ever call their balls boxer puppies.', 'Break', 'Those all have such nice names, where all women’s dangling names sound weird. But anyway, okay, so is manspreading necessary, right? Is that a good question?', 'They do.', 'They matter so much.', 'They matter so much to the human race.', 'But it’s kind of weird to like, say a man has got to keep his legs together – it’s kind of weird to say it’s a sign of dominance. So what does the woman keeping together a sign of? Like, why can’t you just put your body however you want?', 'Why can’t you just be comfortable? Why does everyone have to be uncomfortable?', 'For the sake of, of something that doesn’t even exist. These rules.', 'But you gotta be a lady, you know.', 'That’s one of the requirements of karate, is that you’re a lady.', 'They do.', 'Another military term for your balls.', 'Ok, that’s nice.', 'Yeah. Well, I guess again it’s part of the natural loads – it’s the natural load stuff, right? It’s in  Move Your DNA , the book that we’re just talking – it’s like, what are the natural loads to the body? It’s not just your exercise for your arms and your legs. You have to think about what kind of load altering habits do you have, sitting down in a chair all day is certainly load altering to your body. And putting on underwear to your body every day is load altering to your junk. Like, it’s just pretty simple, and when you talk – so in the breast show, we talked about you’ve got suspensory structures that adapt to the weight of structures, that are your support structures, ad that the way that they stay strong is by having to do something. And you’ve outsourced the work of your breast support to your bra, and in the same way you could be outsourcing the work of the support structures to your underwear, but even more importantly, I think to men is that unlike the breast, which don’t change – that aren’t lowered away from and closer to your body, your balls – and I just prefer ‘balls’ to ‘testicles’ – your balls are moved away from you and brought closer to you based on the temperature within them. So they are doing an essential process. So if you’ve ever been in really cold water, there’s a muscle called your cremaster that will pull them way up close to your body to help them stay warm, also known as shrinkage, yes? But it’s not really shrinkage. Your body is pulling them close to protect the mechanism of what’s happening inside. So it’d be nice, and it can also let them drop away from you to prevent that from being too hot. So you’ve got thermal control – you actually have a muscle that’s responsible for thermal control that is rendered disabled if you’re always wearing clothing that keeps them up close to your body, regardless of what their biological need for the appropriate temperature is. So that’s – to me, that’s why going commando is, perhaps, helpful. You know, that you’ve got muscles that are – become detrained by putting on something that keeps the muscle from moving apart from (audio garbled.)', 'Or 25, or 25 years.', 'Yeah, and then again to extrapolate that to the bigger idea of alignment and movement, it’s that muscle’s job isn’t only to move your balls. By moving your balls, that muscle also keeps the area around it healthy because packed in organically within movement of muscles is other health-making things for your body. So we talked about cellular feeding, right? All of the trillions of cells in your body need to eat oxygen, and they need their waste cleaned up when they’re done, but the oxygen delivery system is really based on muscle use. So if you have a habit that has been compromising a particular muscles’ work, you prevent – you’ve been preventing it from contracting and relaxing and contracting and relaxing. You might say, well, what’s the big deal? If I have a sperm problem or if I have whatever, I can get – I can fix that particular problem with medical intervention. It’s like, well, packaged in with that natural load of moving – contracting and relaxing and contracting and relaxing – is also all of the movements that keep that whole area of your body fed so you can have malnourished cells local to that area as well. And so with the rise of testicular issues, you know, specifically cancers and looking at, well, what’s happening locally to that area that we can particularly – that’s easy , that’s easy to fix, that has very little cost – you know, I mean like cost in terms of your time or money. Those are the solutions that we should start exploring, specifically in the light of mechnotransduction and how cancer is responsive to loads in that it can undo it. I just like to talk about going commando for many reasons.', 'For breasts, yeah', 'I’m trying to – I get what you’re saying. Are you talking about that there’s actually buttons there, pushing on the penis?', 'Sure.', 'Correct. Correct. Absolutely.', 'Well, and that’s – well, I think that’s a really good point. With all of the stuff, when you talk about natural loads, like I’m just trying to highlight that there’s a problem with your natural loads. That you’re not having the biological experience to your cells that you would have and questioning how much you should have. Like, what is the relationship between these loads and disease? But the second thing is, it’s also unnatural to have friction all of the time, or pressure. The underwear themselves. It’d be interesting to know the root of underwear. I don’t know where underwear came from. But, you know, it’s obviously could have to do with hygiene. It could have to do with, like, comfort, like you were saying before, I’m thinking 200-300 years ago – you don’t have 12 pairs of pants that you kick off and wash and then put back on clean pants. So underwear became, perhaps, a way to get more uses out of your pants. You could wash something small, it took less work and then less water and you weren’t putting bacteria right back up against your body and openings to your body, right? I’m thinking the urethra. Every time I say, ‘urethra’ I go, Uretha like Uretha Franklin.', 'So I think that there – going commando isn’t necessarily, for many reasons – if something came to be, it’s probably for good reason. So I imagine that in a time where you only had a single pair of pants or 2 – it was probably healthier for you to wear underwear, because having an infection. What am I trying to say? A UTI, right? Having a urinary tract infection, you could die from that, where the chances of you having the low accumulation of loads from not letting your underwear hang down would be something that would take such a long time to accumulate, but in the times where we’re living longer and don’t have to worry about things like hygiene, then it’s time to revisit old practices that at one time that are no longer really necessary. They were really important to the success of the population at one time but now become a hindrance to that same population in light of new technologies. Underwear is a technology! Soap is a technology.', 'I never write off balls.', 'Well, what I find really interesting – so we talked about bras last time, and then as you know and probably everyone listening knows, I’m a pelvic health in general is where my graduate work – that’s my – if I have a specialty, that is it, because I spent more time researching there than anything else. And if you think that women’s pelvic health has been under-considered, and it absolutely has – it’s really exploding in the last few years – but in general it’s just been hugely neglected – men’s pelvic health is actually talked about even less. Just a bunch of – it really needs to be sorted out because there are just a ton of men who are suffering, and unlike women’s pelvic health where there are places and people talking about it – it’s like, how embarrassing is it to talk about your pelvic issue? When you’re a woman you don’t want to talk to anyone else about your sex life and your parts that aren’t working or that are hurting you and you’re embarrassed to talk to your doctor. Now imagine, from a cultural standpoint, what it’s like to be a man to talk about – to another man – to your partners, to your family – and so men’s public health, which is kind of why we’re doing this show, is just to start talking about it, it’s just like, let’s just talk about it. Let’s talk about it a lot so that people who are out there cannot feel so stressed and isolated. You know, that there are many things, you know you go to search it and you don’t find anything about the balls as far as “what can I do right now for a healthier environment?” and there’s nothing.', 'Yeah. Let’s talk about our balls. Let’s talk about our balls.', 'It is. It’s not even just a body part. It’s a super, super, super important body part. Like, it’s not a thumb. The thumb is important, but your balls are hugely important –', '--and pelvic discomfort – like, let the ball puns begin. They’re greatly important.', 'You said “weigh” and “private.” Those were good puns. I want to call out those puns, like, they’re fantastic. I love ball puns.', 'Whoops, that’s not good.', 'Okay, okay.', 'Ask me!', 'Maybe the question is just about little kids and clothes, and I don’t know if it’s any different than any adult, but it’s the same thing. You know, I have a little boy. I have a 3 and a half-year-old boy and he’s the same – he wears clothes when he wants to and he doesn’t when he wants to. Constant friction against your penis is also not natural, right? You can’t do a half step natural argument, so it’s the same thing for an adult. I don’t know where – I don’t know how to make that decision for everybody, or how to make those recommendations. All I know is for my son’s light testicles – you know what, actually I do – I have, what I recommended was, how about a boxer? All little kid stuff is briefs, where it has more support. A boxer doesn’t really have support. So a boxer could be something that gave you a little bit of protection of the friction of your clothes, plus mobility. That all being said, you’re still rubbing up against whatever material – you’re still rubbing up against your underwear, the purpose is holding it down, though, so that it doesn’t move around. So I don’t know, just don’t put any pants on, ever.', 'Like, I don’t know how else – I can’t make a recommendation other than “natural loads to your penis include not wearing pants.” Maybe a leaf. Maybe a loincloth.', 'And also, what would the Scottish say, right? You wear a kilt.', 'Not if it’s got pleats, not if it’s pleats. You know, we have kilts here. All the menfolk wear kilts in our family. Not exclusively, but –', 'No?', 'There’s not a big Montana kilt population?', 'Hard to conceal your weapon. Ah, that’s another penis joke! Maybe.', 'Actually, one of my favorite, just, groin health moves is to stand next to, like, a kitchen chair or something. A kitchen chair is probably a good height, or a chair in your office right now. The seat of your desk chair – and without using your hands to help hoist up your leg, lift up your leg to see if you can get the foot to rest on the seat of the chair. Do you have an office chair right now where you are?', 'Yeah, so if you just pick it up and you put it on there, and you let your foot rest, and then you just bend your standing leg a little bit and you can sink down in there, it’s a nice hip stretch. It’s like anything that’s tight in the groin or in the hip itself. You might have a hard time because you have a lot of tension – not you, but the people listening – getting the leg up at all without physically using the other hand or going very fast. You want a slow lift to the other side.', 'Yeah, and try not to use momentum to overcome the tension. It’s just a nice – I think of, what’s the alcohol? Where the guy’s always standing with one leg up? Is it Captain Morgan? He’s always putting his leg up on something? I don’t know. I don’t know my alcohols.', 'Yeah, he’s a pirate.', 'And then it’s like, arrrgh. You just kind of do that, and it’s, uh. Maybe you should ride on the subway like this, instead of manspreading you can just stand up and put one foot on the seat and then nobody can complain that you’re taking up too much space. You can be like, you can sit on the other side of my leg!', 'Women?', 'I like it. It’s doable.', 'Well, the question – I mean, the question of social etiquette I can’t speak to, but is tem – but what I can speak to is temperature and pressure control is necessary. So if you are in pants and in underwear, a manspread might be the thing that you do to counterbalance all of that. So to tell a man that society requires him to wear underwear and pants and keep his legs together – it’s like, come on. It’s just like, what is going on? What is going on right now? I don’t know. I just find that that’s – it’s just a very heavy burden that we’re putting on the body. We demand a lot of sickness of our body for the sake of propriety.', '(Beeping) 27!', '463!', 'What about the waistband? You’ve got a waistband, like a waistband cutting into your belly all the time. If you put on your underwear and you see pressure marks, like you’ve got gut pressure, you are pushing on your body again so much more than what is natural for the sake of these things that may or may not be necessary.', 'I don’t know. Is there a National Geographic ball? How come everybody is busy Twittering –', 'Yeah, everyone’s like, I pored over the National Geographic pictures, and – Dani, you talked about that last time, about how everyone’s looking at the boobs of National Geographic. It’s like, I don’t remember anyone poring over the ball pictures.', 'Dangling. Is dangling, like, it’s a part that’s supposed to dangle. Why do you want it to not move around? We’re not really interested in things wobbling around on the body; everything’s gotta be tight and moving all as one lump of lead, you know? It’s like, I’m just made of steel, and nothing will move. I don’t know. I like, I like wobbling, dangling things.', 'And I think, also, too, I was just thinking right now of hunting – when you’re hunting, you use the wobble and the shape – I’d, anyway, use the wobble of the balls and the penis to identify a male, right?', 'That for me, that’s an important part of spotting, is to, you know, know what kind of animal you’re going to take. And I wonder again with the breasts, we talked about the breasts – part of their wobbliness and the amount that they hang and move has a lot to do with the tone of the muscles underneath. The fact that you hardly do anything with your arms. So I wonder, yes, if we think about the balls in a vacuum (hee hee hee) – If we think about the balls in a vacuum, that they have this shape of either being up high or down low without considering of, what is the tone of all of the muscles in the adductors, in the abdomen, and how would the shape of the balls be affected if you, in fact, had better whole body alignment and movement practices as a whole over a lifetime? So I just think that it’s bigger than underwear. Again, we’re talking about what types of movement do you get as a whole, as a whole entire structure, that it’s not just about taking off your underwear, it’s about looking, like, why is my groin so tight that it’s like guitar strings, you know? That there are other support systems there that you can be working on. Because again, this is about your health, right? This is about your testicular health. It’s not about appearance. I mean, it could be about appearance for you, but for me I’m talking about the health of the cells in that area and the functions in the area.', 'Yeah.', 'I think I’m going to go out to my obstacle course and play? DANI: That sounds good. I’d like to go see that someday. KATY: I’m going to hike my leg up and over something. DANI: Yeah! KATY: That’s a good strengthening, right? So you’re in the chair. You’re in this chair, with your leg up, doing your stretch, which I’ve assumed that everyone listening is doing for the last 20 minutes since we talked about it. But from this standing – from this position where your foot is up maybe 2 feet off of the ground, can you – probably not good if it’s on an office chair – but can you press that leg down and stand up onto one leg on the chair? DANI: Wow. I’ll have to go out and try that on a stump in the back yard or something. KATY: Yeah, right? So there is – talking about all of the muscles in that area. Without, you know, you also have to look at how much do you have to really use momentum and use all of the other muscles besides the muscles of the groin and the hamstring of that leg? Because you’ll be able to do it, but it’s about doing it more with a particular region and less with others. So anyway, just something to play with. Something to play with for the balls show. DANI: Oh, as always, that was a pleasure. That was fun. KATY: Love it. Love the dangling shows. DANI: Dangling bits are important. Just as important as all the other bits. KATY: If not more! DANI: Well, thank you very much for your time. KATY: All right, well, have a good one. DANI: I hope you have an awesome day. KATY: Bye. SHOW'], 'NOTES': []}\n",

That was something that came up because people get scared of creating an injury, and then separate people that are dealing with injuries.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, a culmination.', 'You said something very cool in the boob show that we did about people transitioning to braless, and it really stuck with me. You said you should give the work back slowly.', 'To those other tissues and those other body parts that have not been working. You can’t just dump it all on them; you have to give the work back slowly.', 'Okay. Next hurdle – okay, this is a good one. Extra weight. Some people wrote in and that’s their hurdle to getting more natural movement.', 'Good answer.', 'You’re welcome. We are so over our time, but this was a huge show. Let’s do one more.', 'Oh, I don’t know! How about where to start.', 'No extra time.', 'It’s a great answer. I’m going to give you the slow clap. That was awesome. And you just talked about your next book, so let’s talk about that next podcast. The first foot book that you wrote,  Every Woman’s Guide to Foot Pain Relief , which I just can’t say this enough: it’s for men and women.', 'It has a high heel on the front.', 'Yes, but it’s really for both. So that’s a good one. But the next one that’s coming out, let’s talk about that next podcast. It’s your  Whole Body Barefoot  book, which –', 'Totally geeking out about that one.', 'Oh, let’s just not. Let’s just talk about it next time.', 'Well, thank you for your time. Go out and be only human.', 'I love you for it. Thank you so much.', 'And we’ll talk to you next time!'], 'KATY': ['I am not a robot. I am not a machine.', 'Thank you.', 'Well, right? I mean, I think in terms of – it doesn’t matter: natural movement, exercise, diet, changing anything is hard.', 'The change is the hardest part, it’s not the thing that you’re transitioning to or the thing that you want to start doing, it’s the decision to change. It’s restructuring your life, it’s changing who you – into who you’re going to be. It’s huge. That is the biggest piece. The thing – the running, the squatting, the cooking your own food, the walking to work – it’s – those aren’t difficult per se; they’re simple, but the inertia. The inertia is the hard part.', 'I hope you liked our solution! I’m just a human! I’m only a human.', 'Whoa, oh my god.', 'I’m only a human! Yes. Yes, I can. I will do my best – like, right now, what I’m doing is I’ve grabbed all of my hair, and I’m just twisting it to stretch the muscles underneath the skin of the head.', 'And like, you have a lot of muscles on your scalp, and I was just thinking, I’m stretching my feet, like I’m on – like, I have to stand here for work, like most people have to stand there for work, so I’ve got a half dome under one foot, I’m twisting my hair, getting all those cranial muscles, and I’m standing up. So that wasn’t so hard. I’m still getting my work done.', 'I’m still doing my job.', 'Yeah.', 'There you go.', 'Yeah, I mean, the temperature, the goose bumps. There’s so much to natural movement that doesn’t have to do with exercise. But anyway, that will flesh itself out as we talk, so let’s go.', 'Well, let’s talk about – let’s do time first, because they’re not really separate issues. But let’s do time first, because I think that’ll be the more appropriate order, even though I’m only human so I’m not really sure. Let’s try it.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'No, and I think that that’s going to be the big, you said, keep an open mind and listen closely and I think that that’s going to be the big takeaway which is: the hurdle probably has less to do with what you perceive the hurdle to be, and the fact that hurdles are kind of nature – mental hurdle’s are nature’s way of keeping you from changing habits. So that’s why you’ll see that you’ll have 12 people ask the exact same question who all have, like I think with walking, right? “I can’t do too much walking because I live in the city,” and “But I can’t do too much walking because I live in the country.” It’s like, ok, wait a minute, because you’re – everyone else’s solution seems to be your current lack of situation. Doesn’t matter what it is. Like, the grass is always greener; we always perceive that we’re going to be able to change when our live is like X, but it doesn’t really work like that. It doesn’t have to work like that. The solution doesn’t have to be a huge, radical change. But anyway, again. Let’s go.', 'All right. I prefer woman?', 'Okay, well, let’s talk about the period of time in which you are at work. You can get lots of natural movement into your work day without having to stop producing your output, whatever your output may be. So there’s different ways you can do that. One is you can restructure your standing workstation; we’ve done a whole show on that, right? Didn’t we do a whole show on the office? So go back and listen to that show – do you remember what episode it was?', 'Ok, Yeah. It doesn’t matter.', 'Don’t just stand there, right? So moving to a standing workstation is kind of like the general idea, only we get more specific and we say move to a dynamic workstation. So most people are just sitting at work all day. You get to work, you sit down, you’re in a chair until your lunch break and then maybe you get up a little bit, you eat lunch at your desk, and then you get back down, and so you’re really still for periods of time. So my real quick suggestions – there’s a lot more in that episode – would be: switch your body position around while you are at work. You can get a hanging bar in your office, I mean – it sounds crazy, but people spend a lot of time – I work a lot of times on Facebook, and there’s a lot of people who are at work who are also on Facebook. So I know you have time to step away from your computer. I will give you a hall pass from reading anything that I’m posting, because nothing I’m posting is more important than you walking over to go hang from this bar that you have in your office. Or say you have a really strict traditional kind of office, just put your arms up a wall. It’s so different than the computering position. What about the shoes that you’re wearing when you go to work? Do they have some sort of feature that’s limiting the mobility of the whole body when you do walk around the office to go to the bathroom or whatnot? Talk to your office about walking meetings – like, if you guys get together for 15-20 minutes or an hour long meeting, certain times a day, it’s like, you know what? Here’s all this research: we want this whole office to be healthier. Can we take this meeting outside? Do you spend a lot of time on the phone in the office? Can you consolidate all your calls to a specific range of the day in which you go outside and take a walk and do them on your cell phone? Like, there are so many solutions within being at work all day long that don’t have to affect the work that you get done and your job and your livelihood. That’s where I would go with that one.', 'I mean, whatever.', 'Yeah, yeah. And I think that people are still associating exercise with movement, right? So go back and listen to the Natural Movement podcast where, um, it’s not about these – it’s not always about these big, giant things. Like, I need to be moving more for so many hours. If anything, it’s about these tiny, subtle motions, getting them in. Like, what’s the – what was the latest research paper on – on changing the cells in the arterial system? I think you just had to get up for 2 minutes every 30 minutes and walk around, like at 2 miles an hour. That’s like going to walk over and wash your face with some water. Go out and walk out and look out a window. Walk around your office. Stand up. You know, I write a lot. I write a lot – my life has turned into writing. Writing and moving, that’s all I do. But, like, when I – I will sit down in front of the computer and hours can go by without getting up, you know? And so you just have to break it up. Think about less like moving in the traditional sense and more like breaking up your geometry.', 'Like, I’ve been in this particular geometrical position. Change. All right, so that was my solution. And then commuting – commute differently. Change how you’re sitting in your car, you can be – you know, you have to be safe when you’re driving, and everyone’s commute’s a little different. Is there a way to take public transportation where you can stand, and oh my goodness – I’ve been on public transportation all over the world this last year and it hasn’t really influenced my – it hasn’t influenced that I get natural movement. The type of natural movement changes, but if you’re stuck somewhere, you can always be stretching and standing, and I hang. Oh my gosh, I hang on the side of the train, on the inside, you know, I’m hanging on the luggage racks and I’m on airplanes and I’m standing and I – you have to get over feeling odd by being the only person not sitting, but that’s what this is all about, right? It’s about breaking free from a cultural restraint. So. So, anyway. I’m only human.', 'And at home, it’s a lot easier. At home, it’s much easier because you’re in your own clothes, you know, like, there’s –', 'Well, yeah – and, like, you can just go out and walk around the house. Walk around the structure of your house, outside, and then you might have even a little bit more freedom to take phone calls and whatnot. Get up from your desk and go do a house chore. That’s movement, you know? Do a few squats to do it. Instead of compartmentalizing our life, where it’s like, now I’m at work, and now I’m at home, and now I’m with the kids, and now I’m exercising, and now we’re eating, you have to kind of thing about how can I cross over some of these categories? So that would be again: dynamic workstations are super easy when you work at home. Much more easy than when you’re in the office.', 'No.', 'Well, that’s the cool thing, because – and that’s one of the reasons I’m so open with my life is that people can see that I am a stay at home, full-time mother. I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old. I have laundry, I have a home. I have family.', 'I have to cook meals.', 'Yes! And I’m trying to garden, I’m trying to cook my food from scratch – like, it’s – again, I think it has to do with the feeling of being overwhelmed. All of that also, I’ll say that – I’ll say this. I’ll say that I am fortunate enough – one of the things with being a stay at home mom is that being a stay at home mom has become synonymous with being a single parent for large periods of the day. So I’m a stay at home mom, but I also have a stay at home dad. So I realize that that makes a difference because it’s two adults –', 'On two children, and so one of the things with this natural movement kind of paradigm is: with natural movement would come natural tribal relations, meaning you would not be expected to have to care for your children all day long by yourself. And that is – that’s the next hurdle. Like, in my next book, which –', 'Yes – it’s actually my next-next book. It’s actually my next-next-next book is actually talking about – because I have the diastasis recti, I’ve got barefoot, diastasis recti, and then this.', 'That’s right. Is that one solution for stay at home moms is to get someone else in the home with you. It does not have to be a – someone who is relieving you of your tasks. So it’s not like, a babysitter or a nanny. I don’t have any of those things. But I do have a local niece who is 8, and then 9. And I can have her come over to be outside with me. So if I wanted to go out and get natural movement and I wanted my children to get natural movement as well, I could, you know, if my husband wasn’t here, bring another older child over. And I’ve found that the same results came from having other 5 and 6 and 7 year olds, that you can go outside to a playground with your small children and move right alongside of them. So I think that that’s – for stay at home moms is one: get some help. Find some help, help that does not cost you anything, because that’s I mean – time and money, right? Those are the two biggest limitations. But we’re always taking extra kids over here. Always. We take walks every single day and I know we’ll get to this: our walks are slow and labor-intensive, you know, in trying to get little kids –at least at first – little kids to start moving. But I found that, hey, when I had other kids, when I had a 4 year old and a 6 year old and another 2 year old, all of a sudden it wasn’t this adult, this single adult and these 2 kids bored out of their minds at being with another adult because children throughout time have been with herds of other children of all different ages, kind of motivating them to go to the next developmental step, you know.', 'It’s kind of modeling, it’s like, hey, I’m 2. What do 3 year olds do? Hey, I’m 3! What do 4 year olds do? Like, you’re always – they’re always being challenged but the challenge between a child and an adult is so huge, it’s just – I just watched my kids; they don’t want to do anything with just me. They would always prefer to do it with any other child in the universe. So I was just like, hey, does anyone want to bring their kids over? I’m taking a walk. And I found that other moms are sitting at home by themselves and other dads are sitting at home by themselves, and we just started creating community groups. It doesn’t have to be during the day, maybe it’s in the evening time. Let’s meet at this park; we’ll all bring a dish. We do this in the summertime almost 3-4 nights a week where we do a very casual text send out: I’m going to XY park, and I have got this dish to share, bring your kids. It’s not a party, it’s just dinner. It just happens to be outside. All of a sudden you’ve got 40 people there.', 'You’ve got 40 people there; you’ve got people without kids who want to hold your baby, and you’ve got someone who wants to push someone on the swing, and then you’ve got 2 people breaking off and going to do laps, you’ve got some people climbing trees, and that’s how you have to think about it. You have to think about it more like a lifestyle than more like how do I fit in 30 minutes of exercise? Because it’s not really like that.', 'Yeah.', 'Right. Right. I think it’s just because we’re repeatedly told that it doesn’t “count” if it’s not exercise. It doesn’t count if it’s not intense or big or sweaty or time consuming or isolated. So that’s not the case.', 'Right. And also, you have to keep in mind that natural movement is the pace of all humans. It is not you walking by yourself as fast as you can. That is not natural movement. It can be a component of natural movement, but it is not all natural movements. How do you think people walked 10-15 miles with every single person young and old in their group? They walked at a pace that everyone can tolerate. And sometimes you scoop up people along the way and carry them when they’re tired and then let them come back down. But I think, again, it has to be hard and at a particular pace for us to think that it counts instead of recognizing that – oh, someone posted a really great meme. I think it was Debbie Beane of Positively Aligned. She makes great memes where she takes these awesome pictures of her – I mean, she lives a crazy, crazy beautiful life as far as natural movement goes and she had put a meme over a picture that says, like, it was someone else’s quote that said, “walk quickly, walk alone, walk slowly, walk together” or something along those lines and I just think that’s – it’s really our idea of fast walking has to do with what you do on flat & level pavement ground. That you do want to be able to walk – you want to be able to walk quickly and you want to be able to walk up and down hills, and you want to be able to have your heart rate fluctuate throughout the day. It’s just that when you’re walking slow with your kids, it’s not that you’re not walking or not getting natural movement. It’s just that you’re getting some nutrients and then you can get your other nutrients later. And I think that for everyone but especially parents – especially moms, if they’ve been delegated that being the primary caretaker through the bulk of the day is that walking quickly by yourself is a stress reducer more than it is – I mean, it’s also good exercise but what you really want is just time for yourself, and I am all about that. I, too, needed that so what I had to do was get up at 5:30 to get it.', 'And I go take my 5 mile adult paced walk before everyone else gets up. And if we have a new baby, you will get there soon when you can go. But I also used to take my adult, by myself walks with my infant, with my littlest infant because I could go – I’m going to go do a fast, 2-mile walk carrying this 10 pound football on me and I’ll go pick up something at the mailbox and it wasn’t like I was always had to watch all of the kids. So you – you look for every single opportunity and you take it. You take it, and you never hem and haw. Just go. Just go.', 'Yeah, yeah. And that’s also, right?', 'Natural movement flows throughout life.', 'Throughout life.', 'Natural movement is a – babies happen and it slows you down quite naturally and it’s great, because it’s slowing you down as your body is coming back together again, right? Like, it’s all – it’s all packaged so nicely.', 'I do, and I live – I live up in the Pacific northwest, I mean, it’s dark here until 5:00. There’s lights, you can go to a place that is well-lit. When it’s really – we are walking – I mean, it’s really rural where I live, like, wild animals and stuff rural. Like, dangerous wild animals rural. I just want to clarify that – and I’m only human – so we were doing it for a while, but you know, as the end of the summer and then it just getting darker, and with the darkness seemed a weight upon it so there was a certain point, I was like, you know what? Let’s go to our very small downtown area of our rural town, and we met there. And we just started walking 5 miles there. It was lit, you get a walking buddy, and I suggest that – I can’t tell you how getting a walking buddy right now is your biggest ticket to success.', 'It doesn’t have to be someone that you love and adore. I have someone that I love and adore, but frankly, one of the reasons I love and adore her is that she will walk with me every day. Your relationship – it’s just everything that I need. It’s outside time, it’s natural time. It’s chilly, it’s natural loads to my skin, it’s dark, there’s no screen time, it’s talking, it’s adult social time, it’s child-free time, and it’s 5 miles of walking. It’s like 90 minutes. Anything else can happen the rest of the day and I feel good because I can always refer back to that morning. Do that. Put out a Facebook post, put out a Tweet: I am looking for one or two or three people to start this group. Because if you have more than 2 then even if one of you is tired or sick or out of town, the group continues to go. And do it. Just do it. It’s not too early; you will get used to it, and then you will come to love it, even if you’re not a morning person. Just do it.', 'Sure, sure.', 'Yeah.', 'It is.', 'Yeah, it’s – I constantly thought I was never going to walk, I was like, dude, my life is over! I have a 1 and 2 year old, I’m never going to do – it just changes. It changes and you don’t even realize it and suddenly you’re like, why aren’t I doing anything? No one needs me in the morning anymore. And I still nurse at night, so I just really want people to hear: I am a breastfeeding, stay at home, two small children, full time working mom.', 'Who is only human, and I can do it. But I can do it, I believe, more so because I’ve mentally decided that I am going to do it first. The solution comes later, more than I just happened to have, like, I see – it’s like, oh, your life is so great and you have all these solutions, and it’s like, I worked my butt off for it.', 'Everything that I have right now I have crafted', 'Because I – yeah. So, if you find yourself going down that road, just stop. And take a breath. And just find one thing that you can change – can change. It’s so easy to list the things – sometimes I’ll Facebook post something, and I’ll be like, ok, consider this – and I don’t want to hear any reason why you can’t! Not that there are not reasons that you can’t, but you have to start changing the way that you think about stuff, and list at least 3 “cans” before you go down the cant’s, because the can’ts are so much easier than the cans. You’ve been given can’ts your whole life. Where, like, can’ts, with a t, it’s just reflexive. It’s so reflexive, and when you get tired it’s so hard to come out of that space and when you get sick it’s so hard to come out of that space, so just start by writing down – man, I feel like Tony Robbins right now, like, you can do it! And it’s more like, objectively speaking, just make a list. Just make a list, because you will leave the cans off because, again, I believe it’s our natural mechanism to prevent ourselves from changing because it takes too much energy. Metabolic energy.', 'I don’t really want to sound preachy there, but I wanted to sound motivating. Did I sound motivating or did I sound preachy?', 'I thought I was human, now I’m pudding?', 'No.', 'And I also did not come from a family where it was modeled for me. I have not been like this my entire life – so it was a conscious decision around 17 or 18 to start making it happen. Like, I am naturally – I am naturally a very sedentary person. Just so everyone out there knows: I would always prefer, deep down, to be doing nothing except reading or watching episodes of Top Chef or something like that. Like, that is my – that is my default, really, really deep down because that’s kind of the modeling that I got early, early on. But I just started tapping into other, like, I’ve seen other things, and I just started becoming – I started changing. So you can do it. You can do it.', 'Well, I’m still – I’m just going back and forth between one foot and the other foot, kind of simulating uphill, but what I was thinking is, right now if you have a doorknob handy or if you’re out walking – yay! – you can grab um, a pole if you’re walking around the streets. See if there’s something you can hang onto that’s sturdy – a sign pole or a tree trunk, and what you’re going to do is you’re going to grab on to the doorknob or the sign pole.', 'Whatever you’ve got! I have a bookshelf right here but I don’t think I’d hang on the bookshelf. But I have a doorknob kind of behind me. And you’re going to come down into a squat, and you’re going to keep – back your feet up. We tend to squat really close to doorknobs or what – if you’re doing a supported squat, which I love, we tend to hold the tension in our arms. You’re real close to it. Back way away from it so your arms are super, super long, and then get your butt back so it’s super, super far away and then squat down there. Hang on to the thing that you’re using to kind of stabilize your body and then – just stick your butt way, way back and over your heels and then shift your weight back and forth. I’m going to step away from the mic because it’s so good I have to do it right now. So I’m way down here and I’m shifting.', 'Get into the hips by really shifting your weight to the right and the left. Like, squats for particular reasons because we’re after particular loads and outcomes, we’ve got all these alignment points on them. But getting down in there and moving while you’re down and in your squat, there’s so much value there. Like, I watch my kids and they’re building stuff, right? Maybe they’re building stuff out of blocks and they’ll lean their squat all the way to the right to get one block and then they’ll lean all the way to the left and their squat – you know, the legs will have tipped to one side and they’ll move forward and back and it’s very dynamic. I’m going to do it one more time. I’m down here, and then when you come up, push through your heels. Try to stay off your toes, and then really use your stability device, pull, trunk, and come on up, and there you go. See, natural movement: you could do that at your office. You could just do it behind your desk, hold on to your desk. Set a timer. That’s the cool thing: you’ve got all these gadgets. If you’re addicted to your screen, put it to good use. Set a squat alarm. Set a thoracic stretch, reaching your arms up a wall or just reaching your arms over your head. Just set a timer. Do it.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, it’s – you know, I’ve been too hot and too cold sometimes, so I understand. I think, again, with hot and cold the easiest way to deal with hot and cold is about duration. So – and I remember giving this tip a long time ago. You know, there’s a mom, she lived in Nova Scotia Canada, it’s freezing, I’ve seen pictures. The whole thing is like, just a big ice ball. I don’t – it just seems like a snow house or something there, and she was like, I’ve got to put clothes on my kids and we all know how that goes, you’ve got to put all these layers on – no one wants to go out, they don’t want to get dressed, someone’s got to go to the bathroom. I mean, you do all this work to go out and despite the layers of clothing that you have on you’re cold within a short period of time. Everyone’s moaning, you’re like, this is not fun or stress reducing for anyone. So my suggestion was just, then, just go outside for 3-minute bursts and don’t worry about the clothes.', 'And she was like, of course, I just never even thought – we’re like, it’s got to be this, Katy Said you have to walk this many miles and I have to go do it! It’s like; don’t think about it in those ways. Get tiny little doses. Get tiny little doses of nature and movement and just – I think it’d be actually fun, I imagine, living in a snowball, running out of your house, you know you’re all cozy and warm and you start – see, when I get too still and warm I start to feel kind of like, I feel like I’m going to catch a cold if I stay here any longer! I feel very sluggish. And I don’t like that sluggish feeling any longer because it’s unnatural to me now because I – I think I’ve talked about this before, remember how you transition out of like regular shoes?', 'And then you put on like a special occasion you put on a pair of old shoes that you had or a high heel or something and all you feel is like, your feet are all smashed?', 'Yeah! Yeah! That’s how I feel inside now. I feel inside on my body and I never felt it before because my time outside has never been this abundant. So I feel inside and it’s like, eh, eh, get it off me! So I imagine that you could – that running outside – and I do this with my kids, too, like some days they just – I just want to watch a movie, can’t we just watch a movie and lay down? And you go, okay, you did walk 4 miles yesterday. But I’ll still be like, everyone outside. And she could just – or anyone in a cold place – just have everyone go outside, put your boots on, run around the house really fast and come back in. Go walk around the house really fast and come back in. Walk out to some thing and come back. Very short, the kids are fine because they know – they get bored. They just don’t – kids don’t like exercise because exercise doesn’t make sense. Moving for the sake of moving, it doesn’t make any sort of sense whatsoever. It’s not – it’s not for the purpose of fun – it’s just a modern thing that we adults have created to compensate for our choices to be sedentary the bulk of the time, so kids are like, what are you talking about, exercise? I don’t get the objective! It doesn’t make sense, it’s just wasting energy! My whole body is revolting against it! So just some little fun game. Maybe you go out and hide something in the yard. Everyone go out and hide it in the yard! And then if you don’t have kids – if it’s not the kids that are limiting, then go do what I just said and you’ll feel good that you got 4 or 5 minutes of exercise before it got too cold. Just do it. Just go out and do that.', 'Sure.', 'Yeah. I’ve lived in places that are warm like that and – and if you go to those places you will find people who exercise quite regularly in those places outside, but yes, you get up earlier or you do it when it’s dark, or like I just said, you take small, small doses throughout the day. You just take a walk out – also you have to – one of the reasons, one of the reasons temperature is so uncomfortable, despite the fact that it’s – when you’re talking about ends of a spectrum like this, it’s just uncomfortable – it’s that you don’t really strengthen the tissues – like if you think about the big muscles, you have tinier muscles that deal with shunting blood to deal with temperature. Those are totally deconditioned because you’re always in the perfect climate that you want to be, right? If it’s too cold you warm everything up and you dress to be the temperature that you’d like to be. Your body doesn’t do the work to regulate your temperature, and the same thing goes for when it’s really hot. You just create an environment in which the environment is doing the work of what your musculo-skeletal system will do. People have lived in those areas without houses or clothing and shoes, you know. I mean, they had some leather coverings, I think they just found a whole bunch of those in the Moab by Utah. But anyway, what I’m saying is, one of the ways to make it more comfortable is, in fact, to embrace the larger picture of natural movement, which is moving through uncomfortable temperatures is one way to condition yourself to the temperature, slowly and gradually, of course. We don’t want anyone freezing or overheating, but in tiny little doses is when we get some of those skills back a little bit.', 'Well, its muscle, it’s your muscle. That temperature regulation is, again, it’s small movements in your body that are moving things around to regulate your temperature, and sometimes it’s moving things around like blood, and sometimes it’s just moving itself to create movement. Sometimes it’s lifting or lowering the hair, sometimes it’s moving water, but it’s still movement. Those things themselves are also the types of natural movement that I’m talking about.', 'I don’t have that issue as anyone who has ever read anything I’ve written and seen how unedited is – like, I don’t – to me, the principle of the thing is always the most important thing at first. Then clarifying the details afterwards. That kind of sentiment is how I live my life. So worrying about – so there’s one type of person or personality that will say, it’s like, I can’t – I’m so worried about doing it wrong that the worry itself kind of negates the benefit of anything you’re doing because the stress is more of the primary health issue, I would say, more than the lack of natural movement. It’s just a stress. It’s just a way of processing information, and so of course, I think we can say – and hopefully everyone knows – that just doing everything a little bit is of value. The other thing, kind of along the same lines, like I remember that someone used to say, what if I wear minimal shoes sometimes? But then I wear regular shoes the other times – am I cancelling out the benefit, right? And so, it was such an intriguing question to me, because I don’t – I think it’s also because we talk about, like, if you’re reading magazines, it’s like, work off that dessert, you know? Or I have a brother who also runs, so his whole thing is like, I smoke a little bit but I run to negate my cigarette. It’s like, physiology doesn’t really work that way – like, is it better to eat all junk food, or half junk food and half whole food? You know, like, and you’d be of course, it’d be better to eat a few good meals and one junk food meal than all junk food meals, and it’s the same thing with natural movement, and anything. You’re not undoing anything. It’s just input. You’ve just changed some of your input to input that you think is going to improve your life a little. So there’s nothing wrong with doing a little bit, and then as you see changes or benefits you might have what we call intrinsic motivation. Like, extrinsic motivation is like, well, Katy said so right now. A lot of people are working on extrinsic motivation, or a piece of research they’ve read or an article they’ve read or something that someone has told them, but once you yourself begin to reap the benefit, that becomes an intrinsic motivator, which means you’re doing it now purely because your body is, like, just telling you to do it. You yourself are like, I want that again. And so that is a much – as far as exercise adherence research, habit change research – that’s where you want to be. You want to be in that intrinsic – intrinsically motivated space. So if you are, is a perfectionist the right word? If you are a perfectionist or an all or nothing kind of person, then don’t make “all” natural movement. Make “all” I’m going to do X, Y, and Z. I’m going to go outside 3 times for 5 minutes each. And then that way you can hit your “all.”', 'So just change what the all is.', 'And then I think that would work for that type of person that has to check it off and to make sure – its like, well, then make it smaller. Make the thing that you’re trying to accomplish smaller, and then you will feel good about accomplishing the “all.”', 'Right.', 'Mm, Mm-hmm.', 'Well, I think in most of my books, what I’ve listed as the least expensive, like, under $10 in most cases are swim shoes. You can slap swim shoes on your kids: there’s a minimal shoe, you can usually find them at like K-mart or Wal-Mart or a sporting good store.', 'Drugstores, yeah, they’re like $6.99.', 'Next question.', 'Only human, folks! Only human!', 'And also – let me do this other thing. There’s a couple other places I’ve found minimal shoes. One is Ross, like minimal dress shoes. Minimal is in style now. In fact, for dressy, so I’m thinking right now I’m thinking like spring and summer', 'Right, because those are the cutest shoes. If you go to places like Ross and you go to your shoe size, you will find that there are a whole bunch of minimal shoes.', 'They’re so cheap!', 'They are less than $20, less than $25, and they are – they’re not exercise minimal shoes in all cases, sometimes they are.', 'Yes! Like you have professional – there’s your whole summer shoe right there. Your whole summer shoe line. Also, I let people know, like, REI, if you’re a member of REI, they have what’s called a Basement Sale for members a couple times a year, in which case – I think I’ve picked up 4 or 5 pairs of Vibrams. They’re used and they’re returned. So it’s stuff that’s been returned, not usually because it’s faulty but because they have a great return policy. If you don’t like it, bring them back. A lot of people went right into Vibrams and then they didn’t do any transition, they don’t do any exercises and then now they’ve got weird stuff between their toes – like, I don’t like stuff between my toes and they just take them back. So there are just piles of Vibrams and other minimal shoes for like 50%.', 'Yeah, I call them Vibrams.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, you can – it’s more legwork, but –', 'Oh my god! That was actually a superhuman pun, because that was a pun on so many levels.', 'Wow.', 'You’re the pun. You’re the punny queen. Right there, I mean, you’re the pun girl. Right? Pun girl, you prefer pun girl to pun queen.', 'You can be the pun girl, and I will just watch you from a distance in admiration. Okay, so cheap shoes. Cheap shoes, let’s stay on track. Those are solutions. Those are solutions right there. I think that you can find something that’s quite adequate for much less than you think.', 'Well, yeah, that’s certainly, I mean, that’s a valid – you should have – I don’t know if you should have a fear of hurting yourself as much as I want to make sure that I ‘m transitioning smartly, and so the best way to do that is to read and understand the concepts as much as possible before starting anything. So most people who would be afraid to follow a – you know, you need to get more rugged terrain, you know, your body needs more Vitamin Rugged Terrain – will walk across their front lawn without thinking that that’s the kind of stuff that I’m talking about. Where when I say it, the fact – it’s like, I could hurt my ankle, I could do whatever – it’s like, you’re already mindlessly doing so many of the things that I suggest, you just don’t see them as a therapeutic doing them consciously and choosing to do them. So I think that you should just read and make sure you understand the concept before trying it out. Make sure you’re doing the corrective exercises and not just – oh, Katy says hanging! Even though I listed like 14 steps of exercises to try before and say, make sure you do this over 6 months, everyone’s like, I just went out to thing and I tried hanging! And it’s like, okay, so, that’s on you. You know.', 'It’s like, you have to think about the 10% rule. In exercise science, transitions are recommended like 10%. You’re trying to change your body 10%, and you’re nudging. All you’re doing is exercising, you’re just exercising and adding new exercises. It’s just the stuff seems radically different than the 7 other exercises that you might have done. Meanwhile, you are injured – if you are injured – but your injury comes from doing the things that you are now currently doing for the most, in most of the cases, you know, your injuries are not about the 1 thing or the 2 things that you’ve done. They’re like this long term accumulation of how you’ve moved.', 'Yeah. Yeah, so that’s all we’re having you do is one – look back! Look back at how you’ve moved before and assess that. We’re trying to give you tools. I’m trying to give you tools to help you quantify how you’ve moved in the past, and then from that point it’s like, now let’s make a 10% change to that.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yeah. And it’s – it’s an exercise principle that I think everyone listening to this understands. And yet what they don’t understand why taking a boob out of a bra is akin to exercise. They’re just boobs, there’s no bones, there’s no muscles. It’s like, you have to start thinking about your body like, everything that you’re doing is movement and exercise is also movement. All the same rules apply. Just because it doesn’t look like this contrived thing of exercise doesn’t mean that the load science doesn’t apply, that the physiology responds any differently. You’re trying to grow new parts in many cases. You’re slowly giving work back where it has been outsourced previously to flat and level ground, to your couch, to your shoes, to your belt, to your bra. Whatever it is, you have been casted, and just as if taking off any cast, you are gentle with the casted part, but the casts that we’re talking about here – they’re literal. They’re not metaphorical, they’re just more invisible. It’s hard to see the boundaries of them. And so as you’re slowly getting rid of these hard to see casts, just always think, like, I am someone who is fresh out of a cast. What tiny thing can I do and how long can I do it, and when should I choose to do the next tiny thing? How about when the first tiny thing feels a bit better, and so on, and so on.', 'Well, again, you have to break natural – like, natural movement is a category. It’s a category of things. When you have extra weight, all you have is really a really heavy load or a kind of heavy load or I should say a more natural load than what you would have had – or what you will have eventually. So you just kind of have to think about what are the requirements in going, how can I make sure that I’m not over-overloading anything? And I think that in  Move Your DNA  the most concise place it said was in  Move Your DNA  where it’s like, if you have a knee problem, like say you have an ACL issue or whatever and you go to the doctor and you have extra weight, there’s a chance that you will be told that your weight is creating the knee problem, and so a lot of people have knee problems and they have extra weight. It’s like, well, you need to move more to lose the extra weight, but I can’t move more because I have a knee problem. So in that case, as I talked about in the book, you have – like you can adjust your foot and thigh position to reduce the load, i.e. the weight on that knee just by changing your skeletal orientation. And that’s why I start with alignment points. So natural movement, you know, the book seems really big, but if you’ve been reading all the other books, there are so many alignment points along the way. So maybe you’re not going to walk 4 miles because it’s natural movement. Maybe you’re going to walk 1/10 of a mile, but that tenth of a mile that you walk distributed – even if it’s distributed throughout the day – can be better for you if you heed some of the alignment points. That those points will help you deal with your weight because they will distribute that weight better over your body so that the weight itself does not become an injury maker in any one isolated point. You know, people strap all the time an extra 70 or 80 pounds onto their back and go hiking, so the weight isn’t the issue as much as the lack of muscle to deal with the weight. And that’s what – that’s what you want to get first, is you want to get a better mass distribution meaning more muscle to help you deal with your weight, then what starts happening is your fat mass will start decreasing, because as you get more muscle to deal with your weight, you then expend more energy, which then decreases the fat mass.', 'Thank you.', 'Ok, all right. Well, time – time’s a problem for me. How do we finish our podcast in time?', 'Start with your feet. Start with your feet. Your feet are this huge, neglected part of your body that every other motion is going to pass through. So start with your feet. It’s the first book that I wrote, and subsequently it’s the 4 th  or 5 th  book, I have another newer book out. Start with changing your foot. Like, change your shoes. Changing your shoes and the alignment of your feet and the strength of your feet could take you a large amount of time, um, meaning that there’s a lot of bang for your buck there. But all you have to do for time, who have like, I don’t have time, it’s like, ok, all you’re doing is putting a new shoe on in the morning. You’re already going to put shoes on, it’s no extra time.', 'No extra time. The exercises that you can do at your desk can all be for the foot and the ankle and strengthen your foot. No time away from work necessary, you’re still getting more movement, you’re still getting more natural movement, and you’re strengthening the foundation. You can, since you’re walking slow, if you have little kids, you can be extra mindful about your walking position and how you’re walking and how you’re using your feet because you’re just walking at 1 mile per hour. Perfect, problem solved. If you have extra weight, then learning how to deal with your extra weight through a stronger foot: so much better for your foot and your knee and your hip, and eventually it will transfer over to being able to move longer and faster, so start with your feet. Final answer.', 'I know.', 'As given away by the cover and the name.', 'Dun – dun – daaah! Yeah.', 'Yeah, it’s like – it’s really cool. I think ti’s the most – it’s – I’m so excited.', 'Okay, let’s talk about it next time! Okay, bye.', 'Every day.', 'Every day.', 'All right, thanks, Dani. Thanks, guys! KATY: Yes.', 'Well, I’ll definitely be the throwing out some suggestions woman.', 'I am! I am just a human woman.', 'Thank you for reminding me of that. Sometimes I forget.', 'I am not a robot. I am not a machine.', 'Thank you.', 'Well, right? I mean, I think in terms of – it doesn’t matter: natural movement, exercise, diet, changing anything is hard.', 'The change is the hardest part, it’s not the thing that you’re transitioning to or the thing that you want to start doing, it’s the decision to change. It’s restructuring your life, it’s changing who you – into who you’re going to be. It’s huge. That is the biggest piece. The thing – the running, the squatting, the cooking your own food, the walking to work – it’s – those aren’t difficult per se; they’re simple, but the inertia. The inertia is the hard part.', 'I hope you liked our solution! I’m just a human! I’m only a human.', 'Whoa, oh my god.', 'I’m only a human! Yes. Yes, I can. I will do my best – like, right now, what I’m doing is I’ve grabbed all of my hair, and I’m just twisting it to stretch the muscles underneath the skin of the head.', 'And like, you have a lot of muscles on your scalp, and I was just thinking, I’m stretching my feet, like I’m on – like, I have to stand here for work, like most people have to stand there for work, so I’ve got a half dome under one foot, I’m twisting my hair, getting all those cranial muscles, and I’m standing up. So that wasn’t so hard. I’m still getting my work done.', 'I’m still doing my job.', 'Yeah.', 'There you go.', 'Yeah, I mean, the temperature, the goose bumps. There’s so much to natural movement that doesn’t have to do with exercise. But anyway, that will flesh itself out as we talk, so let’s go.', 'Well, let’s talk about – let’s do time first, because they’re not really separate issues. But let’s do time first, because I think that’ll be the more appropriate order, even though I’m only human so I’m not really sure. Let’s try it.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'No, and I think that that’s going to be the big, you said, keep an open mind and listen closely and I think that that’s going to be the big takeaway which is: the hurdle probably has less to do with what you perceive the hurdle to be, and the fact that hurdles are kind of nature – mental hurdle’s are nature’s way of keeping you from changing habits. So that’s why you’ll see that you’ll have 12 people ask the exact same question who all have, like I think with walking, right? “I can’t do too much walking because I live in the city,” and “But I can’t do too much walking because I live in the country.” It’s like, ok, wait a minute, because you’re – everyone else’s solution seems to be your current lack of situation. Doesn’t matter what it is. Like, the grass is always greener; we always perceive that we’re going to be able to change when our live is like X, but it doesn’t really work like that. It doesn’t have to work like that. The solution doesn’t have to be a huge, radical change. But anyway, again. Let’s go.', 'All right. I prefer woman?', 'Okay, well, let’s talk about the period of time in which you are at work. You can get lots of natural movement into your work day without having to stop producing your output, whatever your output may be. So there’s different ways you can do that. One is you can restructure your standing workstation; we’ve done a whole show on that, right? Didn’t we do a whole show on the office? So go back and listen to that show – do you remember what episode it was?', 'Ok, Yeah. It doesn’t matter.', 'Don’t just stand there, right? So moving to a standing workstation is kind of like the general idea, only we get more specific and we say move to a dynamic workstation. So most people are just sitting at work all day. You get to work, you sit down, you’re in a chair until your lunch break and then maybe you get up a little bit, you eat lunch at your desk, and then you get back down, and so you’re really still for periods of time. So my real quick suggestions – there’s a lot more in that episode – would be: switch your body position around while you are at work. You can get a hanging bar in your office, I mean – it sounds crazy, but people spend a lot of time – I work a lot of times on Facebook, and there’s a lot of people who are at work who are also on Facebook. So I know you have time to step away from your computer. I will give you a hall pass from reading anything that I’m posting, because nothing I’m posting is more important than you walking over to go hang from this bar that you have in your office. Or say you have a really strict traditional kind of office, just put your arms up a wall. It’s so different than the computering position. What about the shoes that you’re wearing when you go to work? Do they have some sort of feature that’s limiting the mobility of the whole body when you do walk around the office to go to the bathroom or whatnot? Talk to your office about walking meetings – like, if you guys get together for 15-20 minutes or an hour long meeting, certain times a day, it’s like, you know what? Here’s all this research: we want this whole office to be healthier. Can we take this meeting outside? Do you spend a lot of time on the phone in the office? Can you consolidate all your calls to a specific range of the day in which you go outside and take a walk and do them on your cell phone? Like, there are so many solutions within being at work all day long that don’t have to affect the work that you get done and your job and your livelihood. That’s where I would go with that one.', 'I mean, whatever.', 'Yeah, yeah. And I think that people are still associating exercise with movement, right? So go back and listen to the Natural Movement podcast where, um, it’s not about these – it’s not always about these big, giant things. Like, I need to be moving more for so many hours. If anything, it’s about these tiny, subtle motions, getting them in. Like, what’s the – what was the latest research paper on – on changing the cells in the arterial system? I think you just had to get up for 2 minutes every 30 minutes and walk around, like at 2 miles an hour. That’s like going to walk over and wash your face with some water. Go out and walk out and look out a window. Walk around your office. Stand up. You know, I write a lot. I write a lot – my life has turned into writing. Writing and moving, that’s all I do. But, like, when I – I will sit down in front of the computer and hours can go by without getting up, you know? And so you just have to break it up. Think about less like moving in the traditional sense and more like breaking up your geometry.', 'Like, I’ve been in this particular geometrical position. Change. All right, so that was my solution. And then commuting – commute differently. Change how you’re sitting in your car, you can be – you know, you have to be safe when you’re driving, and everyone’s commute’s a little different. Is there a way to take public transportation where you can stand, and oh my goodness – I’ve been on public transportation all over the world this last year and it hasn’t really influenced my – it hasn’t influenced that I get natural movement. The type of natural movement changes, but if you’re stuck somewhere, you can always be stretching and standing, and I hang. Oh my gosh, I hang on the side of the train, on the inside, you know, I’m hanging on the luggage racks and I’m on airplanes and I’m standing and I – you have to get over feeling odd by being the only person not sitting, but that’s what this is all about, right? It’s about breaking free from a cultural restraint. So. So, anyway. I’m only human.', 'And at home, it’s a lot easier. At home, it’s much easier because you’re in your own clothes, you know, like, there’s –', 'Well, yeah – and, like, you can just go out and walk around the house. Walk around the structure of your house, outside, and then you might have even a little bit more freedom to take phone calls and whatnot. Get up from your desk and go do a house chore. That’s movement, you know? Do a few squats to do it. Instead of compartmentalizing our life, where it’s like, now I’m at work, and now I’m at home, and now I’m with the kids, and now I’m exercising, and now we’re eating, you have to kind of thing about how can I cross over some of these categories? So that would be again: dynamic workstations are super easy when you work at home. Much more easy than when you’re in the office.', 'No.', 'Well, that’s the cool thing, because – and that’s one of the reasons I’m so open with my life is that people can see that I am a stay at home, full-time mother. I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old. I have laundry, I have a home. I have family.', 'I have to cook meals.', 'Yes! And I’m trying to garden, I’m trying to cook my food from scratch – like, it’s – again, I think it has to do with the feeling of being overwhelmed. All of that also, I’ll say that – I’ll say this. I’ll say that I am fortunate enough – one of the things with being a stay at home mom is that being a stay at home mom has become synonymous with being a single parent for large periods of the day. So I’m a stay at home mom, but I also have a stay at home dad. So I realize that that makes a difference because it’s two adults –', 'On two children, and so one of the things with this natural movement kind of paradigm is: with natural movement would come natural tribal relations, meaning you would not be expected to have to care for your children all day long by yourself. And that is – that’s the next hurdle. Like, in my next book, which –', 'Yes – it’s actually my next-next book. It’s actually my next-next-next book is actually talking about – because I have the diastasis recti, I’ve got barefoot, diastasis recti, and then this.', 'That’s right. Is that one solution for stay at home moms is to get someone else in the home with you. It does not have to be a – someone who is relieving you of your tasks. So it’s not like, a babysitter or a nanny. I don’t have any of those things. But I do have a local niece who is 8, and then 9. And I can have her come over to be outside with me. So if I wanted to go out and get natural movement and I wanted my children to get natural movement as well, I could, you know, if my husband wasn’t here, bring another older child over. And I’ve found that the same results came from having other 5 and 6 and 7 year olds, that you can go outside to a playground with your small children and move right alongside of them. So I think that that’s – for stay at home moms is one: get some help. Find some help, help that does not cost you anything, because that’s I mean – time and money, right? Those are the two biggest limitations. But we’re always taking extra kids over here. Always. We take walks every single day and I know we’ll get to this: our walks are slow and labor-intensive, you know, in trying to get little kids –at least at first – little kids to start moving. But I found that, hey, when I had other kids, when I had a 4 year old and a 6 year old and another 2 year old, all of a sudden it wasn’t this adult, this single adult and these 2 kids bored out of their minds at being with another adult because children throughout time have been with herds of other children of all different ages, kind of motivating them to go to the next developmental step, you know.', 'It’s kind of modeling, it’s like, hey, I’m 2. What do 3 year olds do? Hey, I’m 3! What do 4 year olds do? Like, you’re always – they’re always being challenged but the challenge between a child and an adult is so huge, it’s just – I just watched my kids; they don’t want to do anything with just me. They would always prefer to do it with any other child in the universe. So I was just like, hey, does anyone want to bring their kids over? I’m taking a walk. And I found that other moms are sitting at home by themselves and other dads are sitting at home by themselves, and we just started creating community groups. It doesn’t have to be during the day, maybe it’s in the evening time. Let’s meet at this park; we’ll all bring a dish. We do this in the summertime almost 3-4 nights a week where we do a very casual text send out: I’m going to XY park, and I have got this dish to share, bring your kids. It’s not a party, it’s just dinner. It just happens to be outside. All of a sudden you’ve got 40 people there.', 'You’ve got 40 people there; you’ve got people without kids who want to hold your baby, and you’ve got someone who wants to push someone on the swing, and then you’ve got 2 people breaking off and going to do laps, you’ve got some people climbing trees, and that’s how you have to think about it. You have to think about it more like a lifestyle than more like how do I fit in 30 minutes of exercise? Because it’s not really like that.', 'Yeah.', 'Right. Right. I think it’s just because we’re repeatedly told that it doesn’t “count” if it’s not exercise. It doesn’t count if it’s not intense or big or sweaty or time consuming or isolated. So that’s not the case.', 'Right. And also, you have to keep in mind that natural movement is the pace of all humans. It is not you walking by yourself as fast as you can. That is not natural movement. It can be a component of natural movement, but it is not all natural movements. How do you think people walked 10-15 miles with every single person young and old in their group? They walked at a pace that everyone can tolerate. And sometimes you scoop up people along the way and carry them when they’re tired and then let them come back down. But I think, again, it has to be hard and at a particular pace for us to think that it counts instead of recognizing that – oh, someone posted a really great meme. I think it was Debbie Beane of Positively Aligned. She makes great memes where she takes these awesome pictures of her – I mean, she lives a crazy, crazy beautiful life as far as natural movement goes and she had put a meme over a picture that says, like, it was someone else’s quote that said, “walk quickly, walk alone, walk slowly, walk together” or something along those lines and I just think that’s – it’s really our idea of fast walking has to do with what you do on flat & level pavement ground. That you do want to be able to walk – you want to be able to walk quickly and you want to be able to walk up and down hills, and you want to be able to have your heart rate fluctuate throughout the day. It’s just that when you’re walking slow with your kids, it’s not that you’re not walking or not getting natural movement. It’s just that you’re getting some nutrients and then you can get your other nutrients later. And I think that for everyone but especially parents – especially moms, if they’ve been delegated that being the primary caretaker through the bulk of the day is that walking quickly by yourself is a stress reducer more than it is – I mean, it’s also good exercise but what you really want is just time for yourself, and I am all about that. I, too, needed that so what I had to do was get up at 5:30 to get it.', 'And I go take my 5 mile adult paced walk before everyone else gets up. And if we have a new baby, you will get there soon when you can go. But I also used to take my adult, by myself walks with my infant, with my littlest infant because I could go – I’m going to go do a fast, 2-mile walk carrying this 10 pound football on me and I’ll go pick up something at the mailbox and it wasn’t like I was always had to watch all of the kids. So you – you look for every single opportunity and you take it. You take it, and you never hem and haw. Just go. Just go.', 'Yeah, yeah. And that’s also, right?', 'Natural movement flows throughout life.', 'Throughout life.', 'Natural movement is a – babies happen and it slows you down quite naturally and it’s great, because it’s slowing you down as your body is coming back together again, right? Like, it’s all – it’s all packaged so nicely.', 'I do, and I live – I live up in the Pacific northwest, I mean, it’s dark here until 5:00. There’s lights, you can go to a place that is well-lit. When it’s really – we are walking – I mean, it’s really rural where I live, like, wild animals and stuff rural. Like, dangerous wild animals rural. I just want to clarify that – and I’m only human – so we were doing it for a while, but you know, as the end of the summer and then it just getting darker, and with the darkness seemed a weight upon it so there was a certain point, I was like, you know what? Let’s go to our very small downtown area of our rural town, and we met there. And we just started walking 5 miles there. It was lit, you get a walking buddy, and I suggest that – I can’t tell you how getting a walking buddy right now is your biggest ticket to success.', 'It doesn’t have to be someone that you love and adore. I have someone that I love and adore, but frankly, one of the reasons I love and adore her is that she will walk with me every day. Your relationship – it’s just everything that I need. It’s outside time, it’s natural time. It’s chilly, it’s natural loads to my skin, it’s dark, there’s no screen time, it’s talking, it’s adult social time, it’s child-free time, and it’s 5 miles of walking. It’s like 90 minutes. Anything else can happen the rest of the day and I feel good because I can always refer back to that morning. Do that. Put out a Facebook post, put out a Tweet: I am looking for one or two or three people to start this group. Because if you have more than 2 then even if one of you is tired or sick or out of town, the group continues to go. And do it. Just do it. It’s not too early; you will get used to it, and then you will come to love it, even if you’re not a morning person. Just do it.', 'Sure, sure.', 'Yeah.', 'It is.', 'Yeah, it’s – I constantly thought I was never going to walk, I was like, dude, my life is over! I have a 1 and 2 year old, I’m never going to do – it just changes. It changes and you don’t even realize it and suddenly you’re like, why aren’t I doing anything? No one needs me in the morning anymore. And I still nurse at night, so I just really want people to hear: I am a breastfeeding, stay at home, two small children, full time working mom.', 'Who is only human, and I can do it. But I can do it, I believe, more so because I’ve mentally decided that I am going to do it first. The solution comes later, more than I just happened to have, like, I see – it’s like, oh, your life is so great and you have all these solutions, and it’s like, I worked my butt off for it.', 'Everything that I have right now I have crafted', 'Because I – yeah. So, if you find yourself going down that road, just stop. And take a breath. And just find one thing that you can change – can change. It’s so easy to list the things – sometimes I’ll Facebook post something, and I’ll be like, ok, consider this – and I don’t want to hear any reason why you can’t! Not that there are not reasons that you can’t, but you have to start changing the way that you think about stuff, and list at least 3 “cans” before you go down the cant’s, because the can’ts are so much easier than the cans. You’ve been given can’ts your whole life. Where, like, can’ts, with a t, it’s just reflexive. It’s so reflexive, and when you get tired it’s so hard to come out of that space and when you get sick it’s so hard to come out of that space, so just start by writing down – man, I feel like Tony Robbins right now, like, you can do it! And it’s more like, objectively speaking, just make a list. Just make a list, because you will leave the cans off because, again, I believe it’s our natural mechanism to prevent ourselves from changing because it takes too much energy. Metabolic energy.', 'I don’t really want to sound preachy there, but I wanted to sound motivating. Did I sound motivating or did I sound preachy?', 'I thought I was human, now I’m pudding?', 'No.', 'And I also did not come from a family where it was modeled for me. I have not been like this my entire life – so it was a conscious decision around 17 or 18 to start making it happen. Like, I am naturally – I am naturally a very sedentary person. Just so everyone out there knows: I would always prefer, deep down, to be doing nothing except reading or watching episodes of Top Chef or something like that. Like, that is my – that is my default, really, really deep down because that’s kind of the modeling that I got early, early on. But I just started tapping into other, like, I’ve seen other things, and I just started becoming – I started changing. So you can do it. You can do it.', 'Well, I’m still – I’m just going back and forth between one foot and the other foot, kind of simulating uphill, but what I was thinking is, right now if you have a doorknob handy or if you’re out walking – yay! – you can grab um, a pole if you’re walking around the streets. See if there’s something you can hang onto that’s sturdy – a sign pole or a tree trunk, and what you’re going to do is you’re going to grab on to the doorknob or the sign pole.', 'Whatever you’ve got! I have a bookshelf right here but I don’t think I’d hang on the bookshelf. But I have a doorknob kind of behind me. And you’re going to come down into a squat, and you’re going to keep – back your feet up. We tend to squat really close to doorknobs or what – if you’re doing a supported squat, which I love, we tend to hold the tension in our arms. You’re real close to it. Back way away from it so your arms are super, super long, and then get your butt back so it’s super, super far away and then squat down there. Hang on to the thing that you’re using to kind of stabilize your body and then – just stick your butt way, way back and over your heels and then shift your weight back and forth. I’m going to step away from the mic because it’s so good I have to do it right now. So I’m way down here and I’m shifting.', 'Get into the hips by really shifting your weight to the right and the left. Like, squats for particular reasons because we’re after particular loads and outcomes, we’ve got all these alignment points on them. But getting down in there and moving while you’re down and in your squat, there’s so much value there. Like, I watch my kids and they’re building stuff, right? Maybe they’re building stuff out of blocks and they’ll lean their squat all the way to the right to get one block and then they’ll lean all the way to the left and their squat – you know, the legs will have tipped to one side and they’ll move forward and back and it’s very dynamic. I’m going to do it one more time. I’m down here, and then when you come up, push through your heels. Try to stay off your toes, and then really use your stability device, pull, trunk, and come on up, and there you go. See, natural movement: you could do that at your office. You could just do it behind your desk, hold on to your desk. Set a timer. That’s the cool thing: you’ve got all these gadgets. If you’re addicted to your screen, put it to good use. Set a squat alarm. Set a thoracic stretch, reaching your arms up a wall or just reaching your arms over your head. Just set a timer. Do it.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, it’s – you know, I’ve been too hot and too cold sometimes, so I understand. I think, again, with hot and cold the easiest way to deal with hot and cold is about duration. So – and I remember giving this tip a long time ago. You know, there’s a mom, she lived in Nova Scotia Canada, it’s freezing, I’ve seen pictures. The whole thing is like, just a big ice ball. I don’t – it just seems like a snow house or something there, and she was like, I’ve got to put clothes on my kids and we all know how that goes, you’ve got to put all these layers on – no one wants to go out, they don’t want to get dressed, someone’s got to go to the bathroom. I mean, you do all this work to go out and despite the layers of clothing that you have on you’re cold within a short period of time. Everyone’s moaning, you’re like, this is not fun or stress reducing for anyone. So my suggestion was just, then, just go outside for 3-minute bursts and don’t worry about the clothes.', 'And she was like, of course, I just never even thought – we’re like, it’s got to be this, Katy Said you have to walk this many miles and I have to go do it! It’s like; don’t think about it in those ways. Get tiny little doses. Get tiny little doses of nature and movement and just – I think it’d be actually fun, I imagine, living in a snowball, running out of your house, you know you’re all cozy and warm and you start – see, when I get too still and warm I start to feel kind of like, I feel like I’m going to catch a cold if I stay here any longer! I feel very sluggish. And I don’t like that sluggish feeling any longer because it’s unnatural to me now because I – I think I’ve talked about this before, remember how you transition out of like regular shoes?', 'And then you put on like a special occasion you put on a pair of old shoes that you had or a high heel or something and all you feel is like, your feet are all smashed?', 'Yeah! Yeah! That’s how I feel inside now. I feel inside on my body and I never felt it before because my time outside has never been this abundant. So I feel inside and it’s like, eh, eh, get it off me! So I imagine that you could – that running outside – and I do this with my kids, too, like some days they just – I just want to watch a movie, can’t we just watch a movie and lay down? And you go, okay, you did walk 4 miles yesterday. But I’ll still be like, everyone outside. And she could just – or anyone in a cold place – just have everyone go outside, put your boots on, run around the house really fast and come back in. Go walk around the house really fast and come back in. Walk out to some thing and come back. Very short, the kids are fine because they know – they get bored. They just don’t – kids don’t like exercise because exercise doesn’t make sense. Moving for the sake of moving, it doesn’t make any sort of sense whatsoever. It’s not – it’s not for the purpose of fun – it’s just a modern thing that we adults have created to compensate for our choices to be sedentary the bulk of the time, so kids are like, what are you talking about, exercise? I don’t get the objective! It doesn’t make sense, it’s just wasting energy! My whole body is revolting against it! So just some little fun game. Maybe you go out and hide something in the yard. Everyone go out and hide it in the yard! And then if you don’t have kids – if it’s not the kids that are limiting, then go do what I just said and you’ll feel good that you got 4 or 5 minutes of exercise before it got too cold. Just do it. Just go out and do that.', 'Sure.', 'Yeah. I’ve lived in places that are warm like that and – and if you go to those places you will find people who exercise quite regularly in those places outside, but yes, you get up earlier or you do it when it’s dark, or like I just said, you take small, small doses throughout the day. You just take a walk out – also you have to – one of the reasons, one of the reasons temperature is so uncomfortable, despite the fact that it’s – when you’re talking about ends of a spectrum like this, it’s just uncomfortable – it’s that you don’t really strengthen the tissues – like if you think about the big muscles, you have tinier muscles that deal with shunting blood to deal with temperature. Those are totally deconditioned because you’re always in the perfect climate that you want to be, right? If it’s too cold you warm everything up and you dress to be the temperature that you’d like to be. Your body doesn’t do the work to regulate your temperature, and the same thing goes for when it’s really hot. You just create an environment in which the environment is doing the work of what your musculo-skeletal system will do. People have lived in those areas without houses or clothing and shoes, you know. I mean, they had some leather coverings, I think they just found a whole bunch of those in the Moab by Utah. But anyway, what I’m saying is, one of the ways to make it more comfortable is, in fact, to embrace the larger picture of natural movement, which is moving through uncomfortable temperatures is one way to condition yourself to the temperature, slowly and gradually, of course. We don’t want anyone freezing or overheating, but in tiny little doses is when we get some of those skills back a little bit.', 'Well, its muscle, it’s your muscle. That temperature regulation is, again, it’s small movements in your body that are moving things around to regulate your temperature, and sometimes it’s moving things around like blood, and sometimes it’s just moving itself to create movement. Sometimes it’s lifting or lowering the hair, sometimes it’s moving water, but it’s still movement. Those things themselves are also the types of natural movement that I’m talking about.', 'I don’t have that issue as anyone who has ever read anything I’ve written and seen how unedited is – like, I don’t – to me, the principle of the thing is always the most important thing at first. Then clarifying the details afterwards. That kind of sentiment is how I live my life. So worrying about – so there’s one type of person or personality that will say, it’s like, I can’t – I’m so worried about doing it wrong that the worry itself kind of negates the benefit of anything you’re doing because the stress is more of the primary health issue, I would say, more than the lack of natural movement. It’s just a stress. It’s just a way of processing information, and so of course, I think we can say – and hopefully everyone knows – that just doing everything a little bit is of value. The other thing, kind of along the same lines, like I remember that someone used to say, what if I wear minimal shoes sometimes? But then I wear regular shoes the other times – am I cancelling out the benefit, right? And so, it was such an intriguing question to me, because I don’t – I think it’s also because we talk about, like, if you’re reading magazines, it’s like, work off that dessert, you know? Or I have a brother who also runs, so his whole thing is like, I smoke a little bit but I run to negate my cigarette. It’s like, physiology doesn’t really work that way – like, is it better to eat all junk food, or half junk food and half whole food? You know, like, and you’d be of course, it’d be better to eat a few good meals and one junk food meal than all junk food meals, and it’s the same thing with natural movement, and anything. You’re not undoing anything. It’s just input. You’ve just changed some of your input to input that you think is going to improve your life a little. So there’s nothing wrong with doing a little bit, and then as you see changes or benefits you might have what we call intrinsic motivation. Like, extrinsic motivation is like, well, Katy said so right now. A lot of people are working on extrinsic motivation, or a piece of research they’ve read or an article they’ve read or something that someone has told them, but once you yourself begin to reap the benefit, that becomes an intrinsic motivator, which means you’re doing it now purely because your body is, like, just telling you to do it. You yourself are like, I want that again. And so that is a much – as far as exercise adherence research, habit change research – that’s where you want to be. You want to be in that intrinsic – intrinsically motivated space. So if you are, is a perfectionist the right word? If you are a perfectionist or an all or nothing kind of person, then don’t make “all” natural movement. Make “all” I’m going to do X, Y, and Z. I’m going to go outside 3 times for 5 minutes each. And then that way you can hit your “all.”', 'So just change what the all is.', 'And then I think that would work for that type of person that has to check it off and to make sure – its like, well, then make it smaller. Make the thing that you’re trying to accomplish smaller, and then you will feel good about accomplishing the “all.”', 'Right.', 'Mm, Mm-hmm.', 'Well, I think in most of my books, what I’ve listed as the least expensive, like, under $10 in most cases are swim shoes. You can slap swim shoes on your kids: there’s a minimal shoe, you can usually find them at like K-mart or Wal-Mart or a sporting good store.', 'Drugstores, yeah, they’re like $6.99.', 'Next question.', 'Only human, folks! Only human!', 'And also – let me do this other thing. There’s a couple other places I’ve found minimal shoes. One is Ross, like minimal dress shoes. Minimal is in style now. In fact, for dressy, so I’m thinking right now I’m thinking like spring and summer', 'Right, because those are the cutest shoes. If you go to places like Ross and you go to your shoe size, you will find that there are a whole bunch of minimal shoes.', 'They’re so cheap!', 'They are less than $20, less than $25, and they are – they’re not exercise minimal shoes in all cases, sometimes they are.', 'Yes! Like you have professional – there’s your whole summer shoe right there. Your whole summer shoe line. Also, I let people know, like, REI, if you’re a member of REI, they have what’s called a Basement Sale for members a couple times a year, in which case – I think I’ve picked up 4 or 5 pairs of Vibrams. They’re used and they’re returned. So it’s stuff that’s been returned, not usually because it’s faulty but because they have a great return policy. If you don’t like it, bring them back. A lot of people went right into Vibrams and then they didn’t do any transition, they don’t do any exercises and then now they’ve got weird stuff between their toes – like, I don’t like stuff between my toes and they just take them back. So there are just piles of Vibrams and other minimal shoes for like 50%.', 'Yeah, I call them Vibrams.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, you can – it’s more legwork, but –', 'Oh my god! That was actually a superhuman pun, because that was a pun on so many levels.', 'Wow.', 'You’re the pun. You’re the punny queen. Right there, I mean, you’re the pun girl. Right? Pun girl, you prefer pun girl to pun queen.', 'You can be the pun girl, and I will just watch you from a distance in admiration. Okay, so cheap shoes. Cheap shoes, let’s stay on track. Those are solutions. Those are solutions right there. I think that you can find something that’s quite adequate for much less than you think.', 'Well, yeah, that’s certainly, I mean, that’s a valid – you should have – I don’t know if you should have a fear of hurting yourself as much as I want to make sure that I ‘m transitioning smartly, and so the best way to do that is to read and understand the concepts as much as possible before starting anything. So most people who would be afraid to follow a – you know, you need to get more rugged terrain, you know, your body needs more Vitamin Rugged Terrain – will walk across their front lawn without thinking that that’s the kind of stuff that I’m talking about. Where when I say it, the fact – it’s like, I could hurt my ankle, I could do whatever – it’s like, you’re already mindlessly doing so many of the things that I suggest, you just don’t see them as a therapeutic doing them consciously and choosing to do them. So I think that you should just read and make sure you understand the concept before trying it out. Make sure you’re doing the corrective exercises and not just – oh, Katy says hanging! Even though I listed like 14 steps of exercises to try before and say, make sure you do this over 6 months, everyone’s like, I just went out to thing and I tried hanging! And it’s like, okay, so, that’s on you. You know.', 'It’s like, you have to think about the 10% rule. In exercise science, transitions are recommended like 10%. You’re trying to change your body 10%, and you’re nudging. All you’re doing is exercising, you’re just exercising and adding new exercises. It’s just the stuff seems radically different than the 7 other exercises that you might have done. Meanwhile, you are injured – if you are injured – but your injury comes from doing the things that you are now currently doing for the most, in most of the cases, you know, your injuries are not about the 1 thing or the 2 things that you’ve done. They’re like this long term accumulation of how you’ve moved.', 'Yeah. Yeah, so that’s all we’re having you do is one – look back! Look back at how you’ve moved before and assess that. We’re trying to give you tools. I’m trying to give you tools to help you quantify how you’ve moved in the past, and then from that point it’s like, now let’s make a 10% change to that.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yeah. And it’s – it’s an exercise principle that I think everyone listening to this understands. And yet what they don’t understand why taking a boob out of a bra is akin to exercise. They’re just boobs, there’s no bones, there’s no muscles. It’s like, you have to start thinking about your body like, everything that you’re doing is movement and exercise is also movement. All the same rules apply. Just because it doesn’t look like this contrived thing of exercise doesn’t mean that the load science doesn’t apply, that the physiology responds any differently. You’re trying to grow new parts in many cases. You’re slowly giving work back where it has been outsourced previously to flat and level ground, to your couch, to your shoes, to your belt, to your bra. Whatever it is, you have been casted, and just as if taking off any cast, you are gentle with the casted part, but the casts that we’re talking about here – they’re literal. They’re not metaphorical, they’re just more invisible. It’s hard to see the boundaries of them. And so as you’re slowly getting rid of these hard to see casts, just always think, like, I am someone who is fresh out of a cast. What tiny thing can I do and how long can I do it, and when should I choose to do the next tiny thing? How about when the first tiny thing feels a bit better, and so on, and so on.', 'Well, again, you have to break natural – like, natural movement is a category. It’s a category of things. When you have extra weight, all you have is really a really heavy load or a kind of heavy load or I should say a more natural load than what you would have had – or what you will have eventually. So you just kind of have to think about what are the requirements in going, how can I make sure that I’m not over-overloading anything? And I think that in  Move Your DNA  the most concise place it said was in  Move Your DNA  where it’s like, if you have a knee problem, like say you have an ACL issue or whatever and you go to the doctor and you have extra weight, there’s a chance that you will be told that your weight is creating the knee problem, and so a lot of people have knee problems and they have extra weight. It’s like, well, you need to move more to lose the extra weight, but I can’t move more because I have a knee problem. So in that case, as I talked about in the book, you have – like you can adjust your foot and thigh position to reduce the load, i.e. the weight on that knee just by changing your skeletal orientation. And that’s why I start with alignment points. So natural movement, you know, the book seems really big, but if you’ve been reading all the other books, there are so many alignment points along the way. So maybe you’re not going to walk 4 miles because it’s natural movement. Maybe you’re going to walk 1/10 of a mile, but that tenth of a mile that you walk distributed – even if it’s distributed throughout the day – can be better for you if you heed some of the alignment points. That those points will help you deal with your weight because they will distribute that weight better over your body so that the weight itself does not become an injury maker in any one isolated point. You know, people strap all the time an extra 70 or 80 pounds onto their back and go hiking, so the weight isn’t the issue as much as the lack of muscle to deal with the weight. And that’s what – that’s what you want to get first, is you want to get a better mass distribution meaning more muscle to help you deal with your weight, then what starts happening is your fat mass will start decreasing, because as you get more muscle to deal with your weight, you then expend more energy, which then decreases the fat mass.', 'Thank you.', 'Ok, all right. Well, time – time’s a problem for me. How do we finish our podcast in time?', 'Start with your feet. Start with your feet. Your feet are this huge, neglected part of your body that every other motion is going to pass through. So start with your feet. It’s the first book that I wrote, and subsequently it’s the 4 th  or 5 th  book, I have another newer book out. Start with changing your foot. Like, change your shoes. Changing your shoes and the alignment of your feet and the strength of your feet could take you a large amount of time, um, meaning that there’s a lot of bang for your buck there. But all you have to do for time, who have like, I don’t have time, it’s like, ok, all you’re doing is putting a new shoe on in the morning. You’re already going to put shoes on, it’s no extra time.', 'No extra time. The exercises that you can do at your desk can all be for the foot and the ankle and strengthen your foot. No time away from work necessary, you’re still getting more movement, you’re still getting more natural movement, and you’re strengthening the foundation. You can, since you’re walking slow, if you have little kids, you can be extra mindful about your walking position and how you’re walking and how you’re using your feet because you’re just walking at 1 mile per hour. Perfect, problem solved. If you have extra weight, then learning how to deal with your extra weight through a stronger foot: so much better for your foot and your knee and your hip, and eventually it will transfer over to being able to move longer and faster, so start with your feet. Final answer.', 'I know.', 'As given away by the cover and the name.', 'Dun – dun – daaah! Yeah.', 'Yeah, it’s like – it’s really cool. I think ti’s the most – it’s – I’m so excited.', 'Okay, let’s talk about it next time! Okay, bye.', 'Every day.', 'Every day.']}\n",
      "{'DANI': ['It’s a wonder you can still talk, that you still have a voice. KATY: Barely. I got an email from someone out there that was like, I can help you with…that. That voice problem that you have. I mean, I’m already pretty hoarse-y of a talker, I have kind of a Demi Moore, low, rattle thing in my voice, but it’s clearly fatigued. I clearly do not know what I’m doing, so whoever emailed me, if you email me again, yes. I will do a Skype session with you, but I have lost your email in the 500 emails I get a day, and I don’t know your name to search it. So just send it to me again, and I accept. \\xa0 DANI: That sounds like a good plan. And then they can talk to me, too. So after you’re done with Katy, anonymous voice coach, please Skype Dani Hemmat, because I also need your help. KATY: You could use it, yeah. DANI: Yeah. Okay, Well, so I guess that’s good that you were aware of what makes it – why you needed to take that break. So. KATY: Yeah. DANI: Tell us: how did you spend your vacation? KATY: Well, I went to (Bleep) Mexico, which is so good. Just doing that would have been amazing. DANI: Yeah. KATY: You’re the one who told me about (Bleep.) You let the cat out of the bag. DANI: I know. Sorry (Bleep.) KATY: Should we even put this in the podcast? DANI: I don’t know if we should. KATY: Did you just have a minute of panic there, going, oh my god, we should just give it a fake name. All right, let’s go back and let’s give it a name. I went to Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, and it was a beautiful coastal town and amazing. DANI: It’s very difficult to find Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, but yes. It is coastal beauty at its finest, so. Did you just go to hang out, or do something else? KATY: Well, it’s funny that you should ask – thanks for asking. No, I did not just go to hang out. I took a  3-day MovNat  retreat while I was there. DANI: MovNat! Tell us about MovNat. KATY: Oh, you love MovNat. Why don’t you tell us about MovNat? DANI: I do love MovNat! In fact, I was talking to Katy last year about Mexico, because I was getting ready to go to Mexico. I go there every year. And I do go to Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, as well. And she was asking oh, you know, I need a break, I want to go to Mexico, is it good to go with kids there? And I’m like, yeah, it’s great, and I just said, and you could go to Erwan Le Corre’s MovNat retreat, and she was like, wha-what? Ooh! And then I don’t hear anything from you until you tell me, hey, where’s that place you stay in Hoobidydoobidy? And I said, don’t even tell me you’re going to go to the MovNat retreat. Oh, you stinker! KATY: I did. DANI: So I love you but I was just filled with raging jealousy for a long time about that. MovNat is – well, you could probably describe it better because you’ve experienced it first hand. I’ve been following it for a few years, as you probably have KATY: Yeah. DANI: But it’s natural movement KATY: You know what? So anyone who just wants to get a visual sense of it, because I don’t even think that we could explain it in words to justify it, but how I first heard about it was in  a circulating video, and I think it was back in 2009 or 2010 of Erwan Le Corre  doing these beautiful, beautiful things. Jumping from rock to rock to rock and scrambling, and pushing a log while swimming through the river. That was my favorite piece. So there’s a video out there that just has this demonstration of this man who is doing what would be perceived, I think, as like, superhuman things, even though they’re not superhuman, they are, in fact, very natural types of motions. Doing them effortlessly, doing them not in a, “all right, let’s get our MovNat on!” you know, it’s not like a training or anything. It’s just this beautiful flow of movement of a human being over the earth, right? DANI: Yes. And it’s practical movement. And that’s what’s so cool, I think. KATY: Well, it’s practical in a place and time. I think that a lot of people tend to argue, like, that’s not practical, and it’s like, of course it’s practical. It’s human practical. But you have to see that like that MovNat is simpatico with nature. It’s about moving through nature, but we can talk about even more of the technical stuff that I learned in the course, but that’s what MovNat is, and Erwan Le Corre is MovNat. He’s fantastic. DANI: Yeah. And what I mean by practical is that one of my early exposures to MovNat was I think an Experience L!fe article that did a thing on him, and he had said, we go to the gym to get beach body ready, you know? To get a beach body. And he was like, to me, a beach body is being able to swim out to someone who is drowning, grab them, swim back, and carry them up the beach. That’s beach body ready, and to me, that’s the practical nature of this is to be helpful and to be able to actually do the things you would have to do if we weren’t surrounded by every – all the technology and civilization, basically, that we’re surrounded with. KATY: And also, I think a big philosophy of MovNat is to be of service to others. Um, in times of crises, certainly – like, you’re training to be ready for any moment, and we can talk about a moment that actually came up while on retreat, which was amazing to see a real-life scenario. But also to be able to pick up your child, you know, if you take your kids out to the back country, something that we’re talking about all the time, right? It’s like, MovNat, take your kids out and take them on these hikes in the forest, and it’s like, well, what happens if somebody gets hurt? Could you hump your kid out? Could you carry your – I mean, I have smaller kids, right? But I could carry my 70 pound kids. But what if – what if – your daughter, who is older, how old is she? DANI: Um, she’s 10. KATY: Right. So what if she fell, and heaven forbid broke her pelvis or something and really required physical labor over five miles? Could you do that as a parent, and is it responsible of you to stay physically capable of dealing with what might come up, you know, in these situations. So there was very much an at service to each other all of the time, you know, can you carry someone’s groceries for them? Do you ever do that? You know, it’s beautiful. It’s just a really beautiful philosophy, I think. DANI: Oh, I’m so excited to hear about it. So how was the retreat, you said it was 3 days. How was that structured? KATY: It was 2 and a half hours in the morning, 6-8:30, and it was 2 and a half hours in the evening, 4-6:30. My husband and I did it together, so this was our – this was our first time really doing anything like this together since having kids, which has been almost 4 years. And so we had some friends who came with us who were with the kids when we were gone. So it was beau – it was like our, it was for our wedding anniversary, each of our birthdays were right before and after, Valentine’s Day, this was kind of the gift that we gave to ourselves for all these things. So we would walk like a mile. We would barefoot walk a mile down on the dirt roads of Hoobidydoobidy to the beach. You should – can we put Hoobidydoobidy on Google maps just to, like, mess with everybody? DANI: I’m sure we know someone who can, so. KATY: There probably is a place called Hoobidydoobidy already. Anyway, so we would do this kind of 15-18 minute barefoot mile walking down through the sand, in the moonlight, just to get totally ridiculous, because it started like 90 minutes before sunup. And it was on the beach, and then when we were done you could walk back and pick up your coconut, you know, and put your straw in it and drink your coconut water. The guy just hacked the top of the fresh coconut off with the machete. So it was kind of ridiculously wonderful, but at the same time, life is ridiculously wonderful. You just have to tune in to what it was. And I was like, this is just a really good reflection of just how beautiful life is all of the time. You just have to – it’s just easier to see it when you’re on vacation and in the moonlight and drinking a coconut. \\xa0 DANI: Well, and not plugged in. You removing the electronic factor is huge.', 'So it’s kind of just more about paying attention.', 'That’s a really good point about retreats. Yeah. And now you’ve got to plan your exit strategy to Hoobidydoobidy, somehow.', 'Okay. That sounds good. I’d be down with that. Okay. So your early morning, and then in the evening. So tell us, like, what kind of stuff did you do?', 'Isn’t that – that’s one of the 3 tenets of MovNat, I think, is combat, is one of them.', 'Yeah, he’s got like 3 things, but one of them is – but not like, to go out and kick some butt, but like you said, to have that ability to do that, whether or not you’re in that situation you should have that ability to do it.', 'Yeah, I was going to ask, like, were you always on the sand, or?', 'Oh, my gosh.', 'That must have been so awesome. I bet you slept so well at night.', 'So now it’s not just your voice that’s gravelly and rough, it’s your knees.', 'You have Demi Moore knees now, so that’s good.', 'You should bring me to Hoobidydoobidy next time, please.', 'Oh, my.', 'What is it like for someone that thought they were going to Hoobidydoobidy to eat burritos and drink margaritas and lie in the sun, and they’re like, what do you mean?', 'Yeah, yeah. And I brought home knee callouses.', 'Wow.', 'I was just going to say, is it happening in an accent in your head when you are saying those things?', 'That’s a quote.', 'Mm-hmm. So you had – now he wrote the forward to your latest book that is coming out, the  Whole Body Barefoot , and you had talked to him, what, on the phone before?

Little ping-pong ball eggs. Those are so cool.', 'It is, and you were staying right down by that turtle place, weren’t you?', 'See, I only use my Jedi mind powers for good, so just to make you stay places.', 'Yeah. That just comes – that just comes naturally. So you just talked kind of about the similarities between Restorative Exercise® and MovNat. What would you say are the differences that you really noticed from your point of view?', 'Wow. That sounds like it was a super profound retreat.', 'I’m kind of just feeling all overwhelmed just listening to it, and I wasn’t there in Hoobidydoobidy.', 'So for you, I mean, how will this shape your direction? Or will it? I mean, you’re always creating new content, you’re always researching, you’re always learning. What do you think – what was your big takeaway for your work with this?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.', 'So, did – did people know who you were that were in the group?', 'So what I wondered is because, you know, how you like to break stuff down, and I wondered if anyone who really knew your work would come to you at lunch, and go, hey, you know that thing we couldn’t do, could you help me do that?', 'Yeah, but you don’t wanna – I mean, you’re a courteous person, too. Like, I just wouldn’t want to pester somebody.', 'Uh, you know, I actually – I’m kind of in that, you know how you talk about how you help people in the population that are 100 steps away from? When I met you, I was 200 steps away when I met Restorative Exercise®. Now I’d say I’m maybe 75 or 50 steps away, so it is one of my things that I would like to do, but um, I’ve still got to – I’m still working on all those – there’s still some issues, physical issues that would prevent me from really, I think, getting the most out of it that I could.

I clearly do not know what I’m doing, so whoever emailed me, if you email me again, yes. I will do a Skype session with you, but I have lost your email in the 500 emails I get a day, and I don’t know your name to search it. So just send it to me again, and I accept.', 'You could use it, yeah. DANI: Yeah. Okay, Well, so I guess that’s good that you were aware of what makes it – why you needed to take that break. So. KATY: Yeah. DANI: Tell us: how did you spend your vacation? KATY: Well, I went to (Bleep) Mexico, which is so good. Just doing that would have been amazing. DANI: Yeah. KATY: You’re the one who told me about (Bleep.) You let the cat out of the bag. DANI: I know. Sorry (Bleep.) KATY: Should we even put this in the podcast? DANI: I don’t know if we should. KATY: Did you just have a minute of panic there, going, oh my god, we should just give it a fake name. All right, let’s go back and let’s give it a name. I went to Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, and it was a beautiful coastal town and amazing. DANI: It’s very difficult to find Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, but yes. It is coastal beauty at its finest, so. Did you just go to hang out, or do something else? KATY: Well, it’s funny that you should ask – thanks for asking. No, I did not just go to hang out. I took a  3-day MovNat  retreat while I was there. DANI: MovNat! Tell us about MovNat. KATY: Oh, you love MovNat. Why don’t you tell us about MovNat? DANI: I do love MovNat! In fact, I was talking to Katy last year about Mexico, because I was getting ready to go to Mexico. I go there every year. And I do go to Hoobidydoobidy, Mexico, as well. And she was asking oh, you know, I need a break, I want to go to Mexico, is it good to go with kids there? And I’m like, yeah, it’s great, and I just said, and you could go to Erwan Le Corre’s MovNat retreat, and she was like, wha-what? Ooh! And then I don’t hear anything from you until you tell me, hey, where’s that place you stay in Hoobidydoobidy? And I said, don’t even tell me you’re going to go to the MovNat retreat. Oh, you stinker! KATY: I did. DANI: So I love you but I was just filled with raging jealousy for a long time about that. MovNat is – well, you could probably describe it better because you’ve experienced it first hand. I’ve been following it for a few years, as you probably have KATY: Yeah. DANI: But it’s natural movement KATY: You know what? So anyone who just wants to get a visual sense of it, because I don’t even think that we could explain it in words to justify it, but how I first heard about it was in  a circulating video, and I think it was back in 2009 or 2010 of Erwan Le Corre  doing these beautiful, beautiful things. Jumping from rock to rock to rock and scrambling, and pushing a log while swimming through the river. That was my favorite piece. So there’s a video out there that just has this demonstration of this man who is doing what would be perceived, I think, as like, superhuman things, even though they’re not superhuman, they are, in fact, very natural types of motions. Doing them effortlessly, doing them not in a, “all right, let’s get our MovNat on!” you know, it’s not like a training or anything. It’s just this beautiful flow of movement of a human being over the earth, right? DANI: Yes. And it’s practical movement. And that’s what’s so cool, I think. KATY: Well, it’s practical in a place and time. I think that a lot of people tend to argue, like, that’s not practical, and it’s like, of course it’s practical. It’s human practical. But you have to see that like that MovNat is simpatico with nature. It’s about moving through nature, but we can talk about even more of the technical stuff that I learned in the course, but that’s what MovNat is, and Erwan Le Corre is MovNat. He’s fantastic. DANI: Yeah. And what I mean by practical is that one of my early exposures to MovNat was I think an Experience L!fe article that did a thing on him, and he had said, we go to the gym to get beach body ready, you know? To get a beach body. And he was like, to me, a beach body is being able to swim out to someone who is drowning, grab them, swim back, and carry them up the beach. That’s beach body ready, and to me, that’s the practical nature of this is to be helpful and to be able to actually do the things you would have to do if we weren’t surrounded by every – all the technology and civilization, basically, that we’re surrounded with. KATY: And also, I think a big philosophy of MovNat is to be of service to others. Um, in times of crises, certainly – like, you’re training to be ready for any moment, and we can talk about a moment that actually came up while on retreat, which was amazing to see a real-life scenario. But also to be able to pick up your child, you know, if you take your kids out to the back country, something that we’re talking about all the time, right? It’s like, MovNat, take your kids out and take them on these hikes in the forest, and it’s like, well, what happens if somebody gets hurt? Could you hump your kid out? Could you carry your – I mean, I have smaller kids, right? But I could carry my 70 pound kids. But what if – what if – your daughter, who is older, how old is she? DANI: Um, she’s 10. KATY: Right. So what if she fell, and heaven forbid broke her pelvis or something and really required physical labor over five miles? Could you do that as a parent, and is it responsible of you to stay physically capable of dealing with what might come up, you know, in these situations. So there was very much an at service to each other all of the time, you know, can you carry someone’s groceries for them? Do you ever do that? You know, it’s beautiful. It’s just a really beautiful philosophy, I think. DANI: Oh, I’m so excited to hear about it. So how was the retreat, you said it was 3 days. How was that structured? KATY: It was 2 and a half hours in the morning, 6-8:30, and it was 2 and a half hours in the evening, 4-6:30. My husband and I did it together, so this was our – this was our first time really doing anything like this together since having kids, which has been almost 4 years. And so we had some friends who came with us who were with the kids when we were gone. So it was beau – it was like our, it was for our wedding anniversary, each of our birthdays were right before and after, Valentine’s Day, this was kind of the gift that we gave to ourselves for all these things. So we would walk like a mile. We would barefoot walk a mile down on the dirt roads of Hoobidydoobidy to the beach. You should – can we put Hoobidydoobidy on Google maps just to, like, mess with everybody? DANI: I’m sure we know someone who can, so. KATY: There probably is a place called Hoobidydoobidy already. Anyway, so we would do this kind of 15-18 minute barefoot mile walking down through the sand, in the moonlight, just to get totally ridiculous, because it started like 90 minutes before sunup. And it was on the beach, and then when we were done you could walk back and pick up your coconut, you know, and put your straw in it and drink your coconut water. The guy just hacked the top of the fresh coconut off with the machete. So it was kind of ridiculously wonderful, but at the same time, life is ridiculously wonderful. You just have to tune in to what it was. And I was like, this is just a really good reflection of just how beautiful life is all of the time. You just have to – it’s just easier to see it when you’re on vacation and in the moonlight and drinking a coconut.', 'Yes. Yes. Yeah, it is, and – you know. My life here, schlepping kids and working is just as beautiful. It is just as beautiful. The scenery was just a little bit different there.', 'Yeah, it was. And it’s just less clutter. Like as soon as we came back, we’re like, we have to get rid of – we already have a very minimal house and we were like, pack all this stuff up and get rid of it! What do we need this and that – we’re like that kind of anyway, but just going minimal for a week. You know, minimal clothing, minimal shoes, minimal work, it just puts you in a very particular mindset that you then, when you get back to your “real life,” you are just highly motivated to make your real life look like the experience that you just had. Which I think is one benefit of retreat is that you get a real clear picture of how different something could be, and then at least at the beginning you can make a lot of changes to make it look like that. But. Anyway.', 'I think, yes. There’s been a lot of beautiful places in my world that I’ve been to, and Hoobidydoobidy was one of them, but I know if I don’t make it, you will probably be living there at some point and we’ll come visit.', 'Well, it’s really hard to explain – I mean, it’d be lengthy to explain, but it was a lot of stuff that was “simple” in theory but upon execution you realize how challenging it is to do. And of course, anything becomes challenging to do for 2 and a half hours, but. The first day was just assuming lots of different sitting positions. Very similar to the Think Outside the Chair poster. You know, if you look at all those poses, and you imagine running through them, all of them, you know, for 2 and a half hours continuously, coming up and down and up and down and out of them to pay attention to how you’re transitioning your body. You know, it’s very easy to say, hey, look at this guy kneeling on one knee on the ground in the poster and then get down in your house and emulate that, but not pay any attention to how you got down and back up. That you’re seeing the exercise as when your body looks like the picture, but what MovNat is really focusing on is, did you get down by using your hands? Did you get up by using your hands? Can you do it evenly right side vs. left side? And in that way it’s not very different from Restorative Exercise®, you know the stuff that we’re doing. It’s just a lot more – things that I’ve never really practiced so much because in my population it’s a lot more injured and working from a place of not having that much movement. So let’s say you have 5 different resting positions on the ground, there’s a squat, there’s kneeling on one knee, there’s sitting on both feet tucked under you with your feet crossed or whatnot. So in addition to getting up and down out of them, there would also be transitioning from one to the other without getting up. Meaning, do you have the mobility in your body to switch from kneeling on one leg to kneeling on the other without leaning forward to put your weight on your hands so that your legs can move in resting back? Can you support your bodyweight through a smooth transition? So there was a lot of this gliding, and I think it had a lot of a martial art or fighting background, meaning, like, one of the functionalities of crouching from one position to another is if someone is coming at you and you need to shift your position. If someone’s coming at you, and you have to lean forward, putting your head down, put your weight on your hands, like, you’ve lost all your spring power from your legs, and you’re very vulnerable. So I think MovNat has a very big remove your vulnerability philosophy to it. Remove your physical – physical vulnerability.', 'I don’t know. Because I didn’t study –', 'Right, well, it’s protection, right? It’s protection and it’s being of service protecting someone else, and it’s amazing – you know, we talk about natural terrain and texture, but there’s a big difference. Like, things – it was a real – it was good for me to fill in a lot of experiences that I hadn’t had. So, you know – I do a lot of my work in the studio or in the home because that’s, again, the population that I’m working with. I do a lot of outside work and I’m helping people transition to walking outside, but I had never knelt and come up off of the ground on coarse sand for two and a half hours before.', 'Yes. We were always on the sand except for the last day, which was a – essentially a 2 mile continuous, moving forward through simulated survival, like a drill. It’s like, here we go, and we headed up and over and we were just moving down the cliffs and beaches and over the rocky formations of Hoobidydoobidy.', 'Barefoot.', 'Well, you did for so many reasons, but yeah. Knee callouses! I came home with knee callouses. Hello! Yeah, like, I mean it’s like, of course.', 'It’s my knees, to match my hands and my feet.', 'I’ve missed you. I’ve missed you, Dani.', 'That’s right, that’s right. So, yeah. So, that. A lot of combos, like a lot of forward rolls, backward rolls. A few sprints, but again it was about intensity in other types of ways: endurance, you know – I find a large value of intensity coming from endurance, even if the thing is “not something that would get up your heart rate” by doing it 1 or 7 times, if you do it continuously for an hour, you know, your heart’s thumping pretty well, and different parts of you are moving instead of just going out to move for exercise, or walk uphill or hard. There are other things. A lot of jumping. It was fun. It was fun, it was eye-opening, it was thoroughly conditioning; there was some tree climbing. It was great, and it was great to see a group of, you know, very fit and healthy people who didn’t know how to do any of these things, had never even really done a squat before. So, you know, it was just – it was very eye opening in general for everyone who came, especially – there was some person who brought – there was one man who brought his girlfriend as a surprise, and she didn’t even know what MovNat was.', 'So that was like, whoa, that was kind of fun to watch someone who had no pre-existing knowledge of even, like, this idea of natural movement or ancestral health or any of those things. It was like, wow, what is this like for someone who knows nothing? It’s like, well, we got to see that. So it was fun.', 'That’s what she thought. She said, I was like, I’m in! It’s the beach – and it was like, at the airport, it’s like, here’s your plane tickets, let’s go, and she’s like, awesome! Margaritas, beach, and five hours a day of MovNat! You’re welcome!', 'That’s right. But it was fun, and it was great, and people were hardcore, and it was really fun. You just kind of bonded and you’re on the streets of Hoobidydoobidy afterwards and, you know, walking around and seeing people. It was really nice. It was a small group – I think there was 20 people, so it was a Erwan Le Corre essentially private instruction for 20 people. I mean, I felt like it was private instruction and there was lots of, while you’re sitting there, just sitting there in a squat for 27 minutes before moving on to a different squat for 6 –', 'You are just engaging in its discourse, right? He’s presenting; he’s a beautiful philosopher and a wonderful speaker. I have lots of Erwanisms in my head that I think of, you know, when I come back, and of course the accent doesn’t hurt.', 'Yeah, his accent isn’t that heavy, although sometimes he would, when he was like, I’m feeling very French and then he would add a lot of z’s – zis – but my favorite one is like, it was kind of towards the end and it was just, you know, he’s like, “Culture is bullshit.” And that’s – and that’s a quote.', 'But that’s, you know, it just kind of sums up this very limiting, you know, people are bringing up, like, well what about this, and what about this, and it’s like, that’s your – these aren’t questions about your body, these are questions about the culture and that type of thing. So, anyway.', 'It was my first time I’ve ever met him in person. We had had communications before; he reviewed  Move Your DNA , and we’d exchanged emails because we were essentially working on the same large plan. There’s a lot of similarities in what we’re doing, and you know, the attraction of what it is that we do is very small. I don’t know if it’s fortunately or unfortunately, because it is – it’s more of a cultural issue than it is a physical issue, you know, you could have a – you could have a Restorative Exercise® or MovNat, here’s your list of exercises to do and then you will be a Restorative Exercise® or MovNat awesome. But that’s not really what either one of us are saying. What we’re saying is, these moves don’t even make sense to do them if you’re not also thinking about how you live your every day life. That the solution is so much bigger than what you do for this one hour: how are you thinking, how are you spending your money, who are you spending your time with, what are your priorities, physical or otherwise? And – and because that is very weighty, we’re – you know, we have lots of popularity. MovNat has lots of popularity, but compared to all of the people, you know, in the country, it’s very small because it’s a very, um, almost counter-culture. I mean, counter-culture movements tend to be pretty small, so you need to stick together. I think that we feel that way, that we can definitely work towards facilitating each other’s work. So he was very gracious to write the forward for me, and I’m always willing to do anything, you know, for him, and I think that mov – I think that MovNat is a really nice, natural progression for people. The people listening, you know, still have separation in their abdominal muscles and they’ve got knees that are pre-surgery, and hips – because, like, the deficit of movement is so great and so I think that that’s what I spend a lot of time on is helping people with the basics, like being able to do a squat, and go for a walk that doesn’t hurt their low back and their feet, and having this alignment portion which then, once you are up and going, then you can transition over or if you’re already doing MovNat but something is bothering you, you can kind of refine, going, oh, yes, it was this little tiny piece, you know, that I wasn’t considering before. So. So, yeah, so that was the first time that I had actually met him in person, and it was great when we came down in our first 5:45 in the morning, it’s dark, you don’t know how many people – you don’t know anything, you know, you’re just walking to the beach to see, you know, where you’re going. And he was there, and you know, he said, hello, and he said I knew you would come in via the beach. Instead of via the road, you know, and it’s like, of course, why wouldn’t I be walking on the – why would I walk the streets when I could walk the natural terrain instead? So it was – I felt, like, oh, you know me.', 'They really, they really do, yeah.', 'No. And the baby turtles!', 'From their nest!', 'Yeah, it’s like, this was school for our kids, like, okay, science, done! Because they just watched them come out of the egg and wobble on down the beach to the ocean.', 'Yeah, you see the one with the broken fin that’s not going to make it, and it’s like, why is it not going to make it? And it’s like, well, some seagulls have to eat, you know? It’s just – it was beautiful. Again, life is beautiful.', 'I was. Well, I was where – I stayed in the hotel that you, that you told me. Yes, Dani, I will stay there, so we were really close to the, to the turtle sanctuary, which is really just a plastic fence around it.', 'And puns.', 'Well, I think that, you know, what I do is I break down – I break down things technically speaking for those people who really need to know, who want to know. There’s a whole bunch of people I don’t know anything, he was like, whatever, just tell me, I don’t care. But then there was a whole group of people who feel almost unable to move or are afraid to move. They don’t understand why and how to do it in a way that doesn’t reinforce, you know, their injury. So in that way, I think I’m more – technical isn’t really the right word, because there is a technicality to MovNat. I would say that it’s about the level of detail. I think I’m presenting a lot of scientific premises because I’m coming from that more scientific mindset, where I would say that Erwan’s philosophy in general is, our relationship with science is just made where you don’t have any common sense anymore. You really have to wait for a piece of paper saying that behaving this way is okay before you choose to behave that way, which is a very valid – I agree with 100% of his entire philosophy. That being said, I am someone who just really enjoys, like, my way of being is seeing, you know, the molecules of things and how they go together. And not to say that – it’s kind of weird – not to say that he’s not like that, either, but I think that he might be looking at the molecules on an even deeper level, which is just, it is how it is, and knowing about how it is doesn’t really change how it is, you know, to a certain point where I’m more like, if someone has a block, though, on seeing how it is, sometimes knowing how it is will facilitate seeing how it is. So we’re just – we just are different. He’s a Virgo. I’m a Pisces. He has a goatee, I don’t. And that’s pretty much the only difference. No, I’m just kidding. So it’s just that. And then there’s a lot more power in MovNat. With Restorative Exercise® is the evaluation and the breakdown of how you are moving on a smaller scale. The biggest, I think I reassembled motion back into was long distance walking and carrying things like your children. I’m thinking about birthing outcomes, I’m thinking about more from a medical health perspective, and then Erwan has kind of assembled, like, these are motions that really you should have always been doing, but if you can get back to doing, you will be insanely functional and have the matching physical beauty that you’re after as well. Like, if you’re just after physical beauty there might be different ways to get there, but that physical beauty might not also be functional. And he’s kind of merged them together, it’s like, here’s how you can have both, because you can’t have that kind of power and function and not look like a form, you know, that has that power and function, whatever that version is relative to yourself. And I certainly subscribe to all of that, I think I’m just working with a population that’s starting 100 steps from taking their first MovNat class, and he is working with people on Day 1 of taking that MovNat class.', 'It was good.', 'But you were. You were in my mind.', 'It’s the same. My work is me and I am my work, there’s no – like, I don’t present any different than how I am, and how I think, and therefore I can’t think, you know, or present any different than I am. But I would say that it was just kind of – it’s about how broadly you put a stroke on something. So I think of it like this, and I’m probably going to get lost in my own example, but remind me of where I was before I left. I went to a midwifery conference and I was presenting there, and in the midwifery community, you know, it’s very much like birth is something that you can do, it’s natural, it doesn’t need to be over, you know, medicalized or over-thought, and are we interfering with this natural process, etcetera? So I’m, you know, giving this talk, and all the questions are like, yes, but so I keep my moms fit by having them walk 1 mile on the treadmill every single day, and we do this number of squats, and I’m having them, you know, get adjusted and it’s like, they have this idea of “natural” that applies to only one thing, and that is birth. Not everyone, but in general, it was like, we totally get the natural thing, and it’s about birth, and meanwhile everyone’s in, you know, 2” heeled clogs and, you know, you already subscribe to this paradigm that nature knows what it’s doing, you know, to overgeneralize. But what you’re not seeing are all of these other areas where how you are behaving, or the line along which you are thinking is not natural, and therefore those begin to affect this natural outcome. There is a colleague who is also a barefoot advocate, but while he’s barefoot in all situations advocate, he’s not necessarily an advocate for natural or organic food, or other preventive things. I remember once he had put out something like, name one other thing that humans do to protect themselves before they have a problem, before they wore shoes, and I think I fired off like 10 of them. It’s like, almost everything we do is prevention. And he was like, well, you have to do those things. So he could see that it was not necessary for shoes, because that was his thing. But he couldn’t see that it wasn’t necessary for all those other things, because those weren’t his things. He hadn’t really thought, probably, about them all the way through, or his thinking was influenced in some other component wasn’t there for the minimally shod or barefoot all the time argument. So it’s just the ability to apply the thinking that you already have to other pieces, so the callous was a real, huge eye opener for me. It was, you know, I talk about hand and foot calluses and function and loads, texture to the feet and hands and how your body is very busy adapting to that, and yet I had never thought about it on my knees before, not that I hadn’t been on my knees thinking about it. But I had never thought, I am also missing a callus from my knees and how much the rest of my skin is understimulated. The resistance to doing something difficult because you didn’t want to scratch your skin, where my kids have no problem hiking through a berry bush because the scratch is insignificant, yet the scratch is what brings about, you know, a more robust immunity response. It was just – it was just broadening my mind through experience, you know, you can really only – you know, I talk about this in Restorative Exercise®, like, how can you teach a motor skill that you yourself do not have? So this just gave me more of a personal motor skill that I can now include in my, in my mental understanding. I don’t know if it’s – it’s kind of next-level stuff, so it’s for the next level people, it’s still getting down and up off the floor. There was one really cool moment of, and this is, can I do an exercise today?', 'This was one that was really profound for me, especially because I do so much pelvic work. So you’re standing, or if you’re not, stand up. And you are going to squat down – I don’t care how you squat down, your heels can come off the floor. But you’re going to squat down into a deep knee bend. Your toes are on the floor, but your heels might be but they don’t have to be, and your knees are up off the ground. Now, say you want to go to a kneeling position from squatting down. Your knees have to get to the floor in front of you. Now, I’ve done this 100 times a day, sometimes, because you’re getting up and down off the floor. But usually your knee just kind of crashes to the floor, because I hadn’t really broken down how to get my knees to the floor, and everyone’s trying to come up and down and you’re trying to hoist yourself, it’s like, okay, get on your – stand! All right, squat! Now get your knees to the ground, boom! Now come back up, and it’s like, without using your hands, right? So it’s like, crap, what do I do if I can’t use my hands? And so he was saying you can drive the motion by tucking and untucking your pelvis. So when you’re down in a full squat, when you want to get your knees to the ground, you’ll tuck your pelvis under, which gives you kind of a core and hip-controlled to lower down those 6” or it’s a 6 inch arc that you have to travel to bring your knees to the floor. But here’s the thing: so that was huge for me, it’s like, I just was always just throwing my knees to the ground. I didn’t think of articulating my spine to bring my knees 5” closer so the drop was only 1”. It was just kind of like, dropping the 6” which makes doing that uncomfortable so then you don’t really ever do it, because who wants to be flinging their knees to the ground all the time?', 'Okay, and so the same thing: when you want to come up, then untucking is part of the mechanism that gets you back up. But there’s another piece: so go back to before your knees are down. So now you’re standing again. Did you use your hands to come up? Because if you did, you’d be in trouble.', 'Okay, so you’re standing, so you’re going to come down to a squat. Now, as you tuck your pelvis under to bring your knees to the floor, you will find that you roll onto a different part of your foot, yes? Can you feel that?', 'Okay, so you have to have lots of foot mobility. This was already in my repertoire, this understanding of what might be limiting you to getting down to the ground is not your core strength or your hip strength, but your foot mobility. Because if your foot can’t easily deform at the toes, right? So as you’re dropping your knees closer and closer to the floor, you’re coming up on the ball of your foot, but ideally as you come up on the ball of your foot the rest of the foot should still stay low, but that doesn’t usually happen. Usually the heel flings you forward. So there’s this brief, out of control movement and MovNat is trying to get rid of that brief, out of control movement, so it requires all of the same things that we’re talking about: joint mobility and strength. And so, um, another big difference is: as you’re in a MovNat course, you know, and you try to do this exercise and you realize you have no pelvic tilt, you can’t control tucking or untucking, you’ve got no mobility in your foot, you know, the response is: you need to work on that, okay? And then to the next MovNat exercise, where I think that what I like to do is come up with, well, what are the 7 exercises to work on that besides “ just do that more often” and when you put them together, you begin to go, oh, I have a glimmer of control and I see it! And then okay, they swirl around each other and then you move on to the next MovNat exercise to figure out what correctives you need to make that possible for you. That’s how I took it.', 'Um, yes – you know, I think there was a couple who had said, you know, kind of in this circle after we had gotten started, like, “are you Katy Bowman?” and I was like, “yes I am.” It was really hard to hide my, whatever this voice thing is. And I wasn’t trying to hide – and I wasn’t – you know, they were fine, lovely people, you know, we were cohorts. We were in this together. Yes, I am Katy, and we are in this together, and um, so, yes. There was that and then someone else I think later put it together, like, I heard you on the Rob Wolf podcast! You know, and then there were more people, and.', 'No, no. No, and I don’t think anyone would do that to me on a retreat. Like, I’m clearly not working. I’m clearly learning and I was glad that no one did that because that would have been – you know what, it’s who I am and it’s what I do. It would have been fine. But no, nobody did that. But what was the most mind-blowing, strangest thing for me was, I’m still – I don’t feel any different than 10 years ago, yet what has happened this last year is almost everywhere I have gone, you know, as far as going out and taking my kids to the zoo or going on an airplane, or in this case, going on vacation to Hoobidydoobidy is being recognized. That’s very strange for me.', 'Yes. On the beach, while I was walking. Not in the retreat, nothing to do with the retreat. So that was – it was strange. It’s strange for me. She was lovely, and wrote me a lovely card afterwards and dropped it off at the hotel, and it’s just very strange for me. And I’ve began to recognize when someone recognizes me, which I didn’t really clue into before, so there are other people, I believe, who do recognize you who don’t come up and say anything. Like, I don’t think I would go up – like, I saw Faith Hill once in the grocery store at Whole Foods in Nashville. But I wouldn’t go up to her just because I’m scared, I guess. Or I don’t know. I would love to go up and be like, oh my god, I love what you do!', 'Right. But at the same time, I don’t want to say that the person, that people who come up to me are pestering me, because I’m certainly – I’m not Faith Hill, you know, like every single person in that grocery store knew who she was. I was on a beach with 5,000 people and one person knew who I was. So it’s very different, and I’m –', 'Well, I just meant, please feel free to come up and say hi, you know, like, it’s not – my life is not being turned upside down by – by people bugging me at the grocery store. But I think it’s really interesting because we were on the beach, doing this retreat, you know, and then I saw people go by, and I saw people go back and you just start recognizing when someone is walking away from you but still looking at you multiple times, and you see it out of the corner of your eye, and I’m like, okay, I think I know what’s going on. And then – and then when you start walking, they’ll come to kind of intercept you accidentally on purpose is how it’s happened before. Like, I was just at the zoo and was around this person for a long time before they were like, I know who – I love your blog and stuff – and I was like, and I’m always like, I always think it’s a mistake, I’m like – what? I’m sorry, what? It’s like, I Just can’t – it’s still abnormal for my mind, but it’s very lovely and wonderful and I’m glad that she came up to say hello. And if I had more time, I would have, you know, given her a calf stretch. I don’t know what I’d do if I had more time. But it was – that was kind of the culmination of my MovNat retreat, and then she was like, what are you doing here? And I was like, I’m on a MovNat retreat with Erwan Le Corre, and she was like, the French guy, he’s here, too? And so, yeah.', 'Yeah, I’d highly recommend it. You should do one.', 'Well, there’s that –']}\n",
      "{'DANI': ['That’s good to know. It’s, I think, your best book. You just keep getting better and better, which is – KATY: Aw, thank you. DANI: But that’s good. That’s what you want to do. So it’s typical Katy Bowman funny, just full of practical knowledge. My favorite part – it is concise. This little sucker is 137 pages. KATY: Yeah. DANI: And that’s including, like, the appendix and the resources. The resource section is out of this world. But you didn’t start out to write a book-book. KATY: No, I mean I’d already written a book on feet and shoes, and then I wrote  Move Your DNA  and then I alluded to this original foot book in  Move Your DNA  and then added all these kind of other ideas that weren’t in  Every Woman’s Guide to Foot Pain Relief.  Really about texture and about varied terrain. Instead of just saying, ‘natural terrain,’ I kind of put it into a broad category in my first book. I kind of teased it out a little bit in  Move Your DNA  but I sat down to write just an e-book; it was just going to be like a 50 page book on, on really answering a lot of the questions that I had received since the foot book came out in 2011. So that’s been 4 years. So there was just maybe 20 frequently asked questions that I was answering over and over again, and I thought, okay, I can write this little supplement book. So I thought about it really as a bonus chapter to  Move Your DNA  when I sat down to write it. A little e-book that I would just put out on my website or something. But as I wrote it, I realized, like, well, I can add this – because I’m always holding back information. I’m trying to write a book that doesn’t overwhelm everybody because you’re always getting 2% of the full picture, and that’s even in presenting big-picture ideas. I’m choosing to leave off different details, different points because the book can’t be endlessly long. There are lots of rules with publication – and cost, do you really want to buy a $75 book on feet? No. And so anyway, it turned into about 130 or 40 pages, and I added lots of different things. Like, I added things like toe walking in kids, and that latest research, and W-sitting, and turnout. You know, we talk a little general about getting your feet pointing straight ahead, but why are your feet the way that they are now? It’s more than just one way your turnout can be created. So I just went into a lot more detail; it’s certainly my most – it’s my most detailed book. I want to say technical but it’s still in my style, which is – I’m writing for the layman person interested in detail. \\xa0 DANI: I think it’s very accessible. Very, very accessible.', 'I don’t know. It’s just easy to digest, and –', '137. I think.', 'Oh, yeah, it’s just the index and the appendix.', 'No.', 'Well, you have a good track record of backing your stuff up.', 'And that’s how it is set up – it’s set up in two main sections. One’s titled, “Think,” where you just kind of explain a lot, and then, “Move,” and then the program, which is all the pictures – great pictures demo-ing and explaining the exercises. And then 18 pages of resources, which is – everybody’s always bugging you, what about this shoe? What about that shoe? You’ve really provided us with a huge chunk of shopping material for healthy footwear.', 'You’ve succeeded. Because it is.', 'Yep, I’m already loaning out my copy, because I already read it and it was great, so I just – and I’m going to buy one for our local library, too, because they need to have it as well.', 'Oh, my gosh.', 'Billings Parmly library will thank you. So when you wrote the first foot book and you said it was 2011?', 'Wow, it seems so long ago. You didn’t want to make it specifically for women, right? But I think you had to, kind of, or that’s how it worked out?', 'Yeah. And just the title in itself, with  Whole Body Barefoot , you mention that you – that transitioning is about bringing all the parts to the party. So it’s not just about your feet. It’s like not a foot issue; it’s a whole body issue. So this is like a gateway book. Anybody that gets this that hasn’t been exposed to your other stuff, I’m sure they’ll be checking out or buying the books that you’ve written previous to this.', 'Mm-hmm. And there’s even – as you said – hairy toes demonstrating some of the exercises.', 'Well, I just have to let you know. I have little hobbit toes, too, that are pretty hairy.', 'You know, my plate is full. I’m cool without doing that. You know, the gentlemen that are featured in this book did a great job of demonstrating the exercises, and some of the toes are hairier than others. Yeah! So this book is just for everybody, which is great. It’s simple, and what I like about it is that it asks the reader to take responsibility just by the two sections that are titled, “Think,” and “Move.” And those can’t be done for a person. They have to do it for themselves. But you ask that of them in the book but then you give them the tools to do that. I just – I love it. Am I geeking out too much about the book? I don’t know.', 'One of the things that I think really gave me pause – and you’ve said this before – but I just, can I read a quote from the book that I really liked?', 'Yes. Who wrote that? That’s brilliant! Yes. Act surprised and go, wow, I’m good. Okay. You were talking about – you were starting to refer to natural surfaces, and you say: “by walking on artificial surfaces all of our lives, our amazing, strong, variable musculature has adapted to becoming very good on one kind of ground. That sounds great, right? Adaptation is a good thing. In fact, adaptation isn’t good or baDANI: adaptation is just adaptation.” You’ve talked about that before, and that just really makes you think about: it’s not an improvement, changing to fit whatever’s happening to the body all the time.', 'Right.', 'Right. And that lets me – I’m going to finish the rest of the quote now because you just –', 'You just –', 'You think alike, like you. That’s good! And then you go on to say: “ We have this idea that the body can endlessly adapt to whatever we choose to do, but that’s not the case. We can adapt for a while, but there is always a biological tax.” Great phrase, biological tax. “And in many cases, this tax is so far removed from the initial point of compensation, we don’t even associate the two, which keeps us consuming the problematic load.” Aah! I mean, jeeze, even if you just published that with a cover.', 'And that’s a head slapper, it’s like, what?', 'I know, but then you’d need to take more retreats, so. Slow down, girl, you move too fast. I think that that’s so much food for thought and it ties into personal responsibility. The fact that even just by putting on your shoes – putting on different shoes – you can change the way, the trajectory of your health.', 'And we talked about that in the, you know, in the hurdles show. The Solution Show, people say, well, I don’t have time for this, and I don’t have time for that – it’s like, you just said even putting on different shoes can start to change how you feel and how your body works. And I just think that’s a great solution for anybody. That’s all you have to do is think about your footwear.', 'It is a good – you should always start with your feet, right?', 'No, I was just kind of – looking at all my little quotes that I had really liked.', 'Yes, would somebody bring me a cup of tea, please? Thank you.', 'Yeah, that’s great.', 'It is. It is happy making.', 'Yeah. Yeah.', 'Right. I can’t imagine you being staid or stuffy. And I think that your personality helps people’s barriers come down so they’re more open to learning, really. I mean, if someone’s having problems following what’s written or being talked about, all these walls go up and then they’re not getting it. But, you know, and they’ve got their own insecurities or whatever. But you – you’re hilarious, and I think actually that I have Jill’s book and her pictures – I mean, I opened right to some of her funny pictures right when I first got the book, and I was like, oh, this gal, she’s a hoot, too.', 'Yeah, but we believe you. And the artwork was great. I actually loved the peanut butter and jelly. I think it was just peanut butter.', 'You know, great artwork from her.', 'I think we just did. She’s – yeah. They were great. The artwork was great. And that brings me to schmear. People reading this book are going to learn about stuff that is really important to their whole body health, but that they probably never thought about, like neutral femur. You know – what? What, what what?', 'And schmear, which is – it’s your term, baby. You coined it, right? Ankle schmear?', 'Ankle schmear!', 'Ankle schmear. You have to add the ankle, you know, in front of it, because --', 'Yeah.', 'It is good, and for people to, you can do a little exercise in the book. A little thing that you can do that you can learn how, you can change the size and shape of his foot by paying attention to that. So you kind of get walked through that, which is cool. I’m going to have my husband do that, because I’ve got a lot of schmear stuff going on there.', 'You know, I just want to have him do that part.', 'I was just thinking that. What? This is a great time. Do it.', 'That really did make it over. Actually, when I read the book I was like, ah, she never talked about that before. And then when I tried to do it, and boy, sure enough, my ankles fell out to the side.', 'And I was using all sorts of parts of my body to get that calf raise up.', 'Yeah, totally. Totally. And it’s something that I – it’s an exercise that I haven’t done since the 80s or 90s or whenever I was teaching step aerobics when we used to do those kinds of things on the edge of the step. So yeah, it was great! It was great. And it’s really hard now, making it over made it very challenging, but now I’m interested.', 'Okay. But maybe you could just –', 'Intrinsic muscles are those within the foot. Intrinsic muscles are those that begin and end within the foot. Extrinsic foot muscles have one attachment in the foot and one outside of the foot, so your calves are extrinsic. So when you’ve been doing your calf raises, you’ve been doing an extrinsic strengthener, but because you weren’t also using your intrinsic muscles, you weren’t using as many extrinsic muscles as you thought. So it’s just kind of a way of re-integrating your parts back together again. And that’s the calf elevator Level I; there’s a couple other levels that are offered in the book, too, because we want to get you out and hiking varied terrain in a way that uses all of your lower leg muscles, even (audio unclear) stabilizes your knee and your ankle, so there you go. \\xa0 DANI: Super. Super interesting. Wow. See, now I have to do that all the time, everybody. Calf elevator. Roll slow, steady. It’s only 33 joints in the foot. I know this from all your other stuff, and anatomy. But that’s a lot! That’s a lot going on down there to be –', 'This is a lot of joints to be slapped in a leather mitten. You know, that’s a lot of articulation and I think this is going to be educational on so many levels for people.', 'Yeah. And one of the neatest parts about the book is that everything – all the exercises and the stretches – you can use household items.', 'You are a problem solver and a pretty practical person, but that’s just appreciated. So knowing that this book – you get this book and you don’t have to you know, sling yourself into debt for buying a bunch of equipment. It’s really simple; you have towels and tennis balls.', 'And stacks of books and phone books. So don’t recycle those phone books yet. I know they show up on your doorstep three times a week, but don’t do it yet because you need those!', 'That’s right. Well, hopefully we’re going to talk about this more in subsequent shows, because it’s a fun book. And it’s a useful book.', 'Ooh, Q&A’s fun. I like that.', 'And you even talk about kids’ feet in this book.', 'There’s a lot of kids’ shoes, yeah, the heel thing. That freaked me out.', 'Right.', 'That was very interesting. That was awesome, yeah.', 'Yeah. You should be.', 'Well, first of all, you’re on the cover.', 'And you’re in –', 'No, no, no! But I’m describing it, because people don’t know. There’s no video, right? So they don’t know. You’ve got a tree that you’re in, so you’ve clearly climbed up in there, and are kind of hanging out on this tree, in your awesome Unshoes. Those are Unshoes, right?', 'They’re cool.', 'Yeah, you look like you’re gonna, yeah.', 'There’s some of Jillian’s art on the front, right? Of the foot.', 'Oh, really?', 'Yeah, it’s very cool. And there’s a lot of men that are quoted in the book about their own, you know, barefoot transitioning experiences, so.', 'I know. KATY: (audio unclear) comment. \\xa0 DANI: I know.', 'Yeah, I am, actually, if he forgives me for telling people he has ankle schmear on the podcast. Which, he’s a pretty good guy, so he probably will.', 'Yeah, please don’t.', 'Okay, folks, and that’s our show for today! Thanks for tuning in to Katy Says! No, that is the show for the day, but we’ll talk about the book more and just feet more in general. Yeah, we’ve got to talk more about feet because, you know, like you saiDANI: start with your feet. And I just have to say, too, it’s just kind of cute how you dedicated this book to your feet.', 'Please do, because I think that people want to hear that Demi Moore voice more. So go for it.', 'Thank –', 'Thank goodness for them. So it’s a great book. April 1 st , we’ll talk about it more.', 'Thank you for your time today.', 'Take those feet for a walk!', 'That’s right. All right, I’ll talk to you later. Have a great day.'], 'KATY': ['Aw, thank you. DANI: But that’s good. That’s what you want to do.

There’s a lot of detail there. And so I, too, think it’s my best book. Isn’t that weird?', 'Yeah.', 'And it’s exercise-based. So I think a lot of times I’m writing – I’m writing large, theory pieces. Like, they’re huge. There’s a lot of – there’s a lot of the argument being presented, and it’s just very wordy. But in the end, there are some people who like that but there are other people who are like, that’s great, just give me the exercises! So I said, okay, I can start writing these smaller exercise manuals that have a lot of detail about – enough detail that help you understand the rationale of the exercise and how to select which exercise is for you. And then, just a ton of exercises. So while the book is only – what’s the page count?', '137 of – yeah. So it’s 137 pages, and that’s actually – we just realized that the reference section was left off of this first print. So you can download the reference section. That’s another, like, 10 pages. And it’ll be in the next print.', 'It was just left out. We just accidentally left it out of the file that went to the printers, so it was – it’s a printing snafu. It’s not the worst thing that ever happened.', 'Yeah, but anyway –', 'Well, it’s like, the reference section is there, it wasn’t inserted. But whatever. In the end it’s less paper and it makes for less shipping. But now, we’ve fixed it. But my point was in 135 pages of written material, there are over 20 exercises. So that’s a lot. It just shows you that the ratio of the book is, uh, “do this” as opposed to “learn this.”', 'Well, I wanted it to be a guide, and the biggest feedback from the last book was, you know, there’s 40 – actually, in  Move Your DNA  I think there’s, there’s like 80 exercises when you read through it. You know, there’s not all pictures, but they’re in text. Now do this, and do this, and do this. It’s that, people were like, when I’m done reading the book there’s no concise recap of – can I just look at these 10 pages and do one exercise after another? And I was like, I can start doing that for you. And I had done that in the first foot book where there was “the program” at the end where there was just the exercises to do. So I did that again this time, which I think makes it a lot more user friendly. I’m just trying to make it a lot more – I’m trying to make the information more usable. So there’s that, and then yes, the appendix – it’s kind of a shopping guide almost. It has all of the, here’s mobilizing products and websites and then here’s Do It Yourself minimal shoe websites organized. And even a how-to and when-to buy shoes. Like, how to prep your body to know you’re getting the right size. Just those little things that I hope make it super usable.', 'Thank you.', 'I’ll donate one to your local library!', 'Just send me that information. I’ll donate one.', 'It came out in 2011, so I wrote it in 2010.', 'Yeah, I mean I was originally just writing a book on feet and shoes, but the publisher, you know, they’re always looking for a niche audience and they were like, why don’t you write it towards women? And so I was like, okay, I can do that, you know. Because women – there’s more research on women and foot pain because women tend to make poorer footwear choices for longer periods of their life, so it was fine. I write in the beginning of the book, the first foot book, it says, this is called  Every Woman’s Guide to Foot Pain Relief  but it’s really for everyone and why I targeted it. But that turned out to be – I mean, it was a fine decision, because there are so many people – women – with foot pain who aren’t looking for a minimal footwear book. They’re looking for a “how to solve my foot pain” book. So it’s – yes, a lot of the solution was, you need to transition out of these shoes and strengthen your feet and whatnot, but this is really a book on a whole different topic. This is a – this is a new book that’s a foot book that’s specifically made for all genders, all ages. I even put dirt on the front. There’s no white, there’s no high heels. It’s dirt, it’s trees, it’s nature, because it really is about, again, natural loads and natural movement of the foot. So it has, like, a different audience. But I would say that a lot of people who read the first foot book will find even more correctives in this other book, so.', 'Well, that’s the beautiful thing about writing books, is yeah, you – most people who have come to KatySays or at least the Institute have come because of a specific issue. They’ve come because of a pelvic floor issue, or a low back issue, or a foot issue or a knee issue. They weren’t automatically those people who are just into natural movement, although there are those, too. So these little books are great, because it just gives you a solution, but it also kind of broadens your understanding of the problem.', 'Yes. We casted. We had to go through all sorts of people looking for the hairiest, best feet and legs to feature in this book.', 'You should have submitted! I didn’t get your headshot, or your foot shot.', 'No, I don’t think so.', 'Yes. Should I pretend like I’ve never heard it before?', 'Or, said another way, improvement depends on the scale at which you are assessing it. If something is an improvement or not. If something is a short term improvement it might not be a long term improvement, so –', 'So good or bad – you can say good or bad, but then you have to give the timeline that goes with that.', 'Oh!', 'Are you going to read a quote, or are you going to read a chapter?', 'I should have just made that the book. That should have been the book.', 'Then I think I could release – if I did that, I could release, like, 750 books a year.', 'Sure.', 'It’s certainly a good place to start.', 'Are you reading the book right now? I hear the pages turning.', 'Just stand by while I read this book. I hope you’re enjoying this podcast.', 'Well, and I was really excited, too. I just want to give Jill Miller of  Yoga Tune Up ® a little shout out because she – did you see her two exercises on page 90 and 91? They were my favorite; it’s in the turnout section. There’s different types of foot turnout. There’s – well, you can read about them in the book. But she gave some really cool mobilizing exercises you can do with Yoga  Tune Up ® or a tennis ball, so I just wanted to say, “I love you, Jill!” And her picutres were so great. Like, the book is – I’m a very casual person as everyone knows. And I just like – I like the pictures in this book. I like the pictures in the first book, too, but, you know, there’s these kind of cool dudes, and it’s just pictures of different foot exercises, how to trace it and measure your foot and see if your rotation is changing the size of your foot. And then there’s Jill with her Fascia is the New Black tank top and her dog, like, walking over in the pictures.', 'It’s just like – you know, being well is happy making.', 'It’s happy making, and so I just think that a book doesn’t have to be staunch, is that the right word? It doesn’t have to be stuffy.', 'I just like that. I mean, I like that. And I’ll get flack for that sometimes, you know, just – you’re too casual or whatever. And even normalizing for the fact that I’m from California, it’s like, it’s because I think that, I think that perfection of that type is a façade, and being silly is okay and being happy and funny is okay. And as part of what makes doing 17 minutes of foot exercises that much more enjoyable.', 'Yeah. She’s funny. But I think that’s why leaving the reference section – that I was bummed about that, because that’s how I can balance my explanation of schmear – you know, which is the effect of pronation on the whole body is done with peanut butter and jelly pictures, right? So the reference section is a nice way to balance my silliness. So we added a sticker that said, go down to the reference sticker here, just to balance out – I mean, I feel better about my silliness if it’s, you know, all official.', 'It is. Jillian, Jillian did that.', 'Jillian is amazing. You should give a nod to Jillian for some amazing pictures.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yup.', 'And I got, you know, I got some good feedback. I got some reviews, like I had a lot of different health professionals, podiatrists, athletic trainers do a review of this book saying early stuff and some of the best feedback was like, I am totally using schmear now. I’ll reference you, but this has been a term that has been missing in the technical language, because there is no word to explain the effects of a movement, just describing the movement as happening without the ground. Again, in the vacuum. So much anatomical speak is in the vacuum, so – yes. I don’t know – I mean, someone might change the schmear. I don’t know if you’ll ever see schmear in a textbook in 20 years, but you’ll probably see some reference to it. But schmear is the best word!', 'Ankle schmear. Foot scmear.', 'There’s a lot of different parts for schmearing.', 'Schmear.', 'well, I was super excited, because this is an exercise that I’ve been teaching for years but have never made it into any blog post or book or anything. So it is, you know, brand new. It’s a nice addition for people who have been – you know, who read everything and have taken all the courses. It’s not even in the Institute’s course, so it might be new to you. But it’s essentially a calf raise, so if everyone just does a calf raise like you’re standing, and then you go on your toes and you come back down, that’s a calf raise. But if you pay attention to the way that you’re doing the calf raise, in many cases the calf raise is done by as you lift, as your heel comes away from the ground, you actually roll onto the outside of your foot. So, if you’re up on your toes like I am right now, you’re more on the pinky toe side of the foot and the ball of the foot is not pressing into the ground very much. There’s a good picture of this in the book and so you can see that the ankles really fall away from each other, and there’s also a rotation that’s happening at the hip. So you’re doing “the calf raise” but you’re not using very much calf to do it. So, you’re going to make it over by doing what I call calf elevators because elevators go straight up and straight down, unless you’re on a Willy Wonka elevator. But you’re going to press the ball of your foot down before you go up into a calf raise. You’re going to press the ball of the foot down. Lift the toes up, press the ball of the foot down, and kind of come off of the outside edge of your foot. The outside edge is still in contact, but it’s not – if you had a scale under the outside edge of your foot and under the ball of your foot, the outside edge should not show a heavier weight than the ball of the foot. And then you’re going to calf raise, pressing the ball of the foot down, keeping your ankle joint stable so that it’s a pure up-and-down motion and doesn’t have this kind of sideways fall-out or translation of the ankle joints. So do that. The end.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, you’re shoving your pelvis out in front of you.', 'Here’s the other thing: you haven’t done it in the 80s since your step aerobics, you know, do 10 calf raises. But you use that motion every time you take a step. So when you do the calf raise, if your ankles fall out, your ankles are falling out with every step that you’re taking. So this was a way of showing you how you move all the time in a real, kind of concentrated alignment laboratory. So as you get stronger throughout the breadth of your calf muscles, as you recruit them more uniformly, that will translate to how you are walking, to how your calves are able – and your foot. It’s really the motion of the foot. You’re really using a lot more intrinsic foot musculature while you’re using your extrinsic musculature, which are explained in the book.', 'No, I’m not. I refuse. You have to – no, I’m kidding. Yes, I will.', 'Thank you for noticing.', 'Well, at least on ground level first.', 'That’s – that’s my thing, you know.', 'And stacks of books.', 'That’s your lateral hip strength maker right there!', 'Yeah, you know, I think there’s enough people that have it now that’d it’d be fun to do a show answering specific Q&A from people who have read the book, you know, clarifying and just getting commentary. So maybe we can do that next.', 'Q&A is easy. Yeah.', 'There’s a lot of kids’ shoes!', 'Can I read my favorite part? No, I’m just kidding, to all you listening. My favorite sections in the book were all of the kid stuff. W-sitting. Toe walking, and heeled childrens’ shoes. They’re actually sidebars. There are 3, like, small subsections within the book that just talk about this thought all the way through and present the details of each one of those. And I think that parents will find a lot of value in the book, even though it’s not a book about – it’s a book about feet, human feet. Kids, adults. But I just find that those sections are what I find I get a lot of questions on, you know, the W-sitting, the famous W-sitting picture of my niece. But within the context of a foot book, it just made a lot of sense because we don’t think of W-sitting as something that goes on eventually to become a turnout maker, right?', 'So if you’re going, I have a turnout problem as an adult, and you’re trying to fix it by doing these corrective exercises, but then you see your children W-sitting, you might not put 2 and 2 together, that maybe your turnout arose – risen up? Like, I’m verbally just having lots of problems. It can be brought about – it can be exacerbated by that way of sitting. So these little things, you know, let’s look at 3 little things of how much texture are your kids exposed to and what does the texture input do to the gait cycle for kids?', 'It was. That was a last minute add because I just had read the newest research that had come out, I’m like, this is fascinating. This needs to be in a book for other people to read about, and I just knew that this piece of literature – no one would ever read about and it would get buried. And so I was like, I’m going to make a whole sidebar about that. I think it’s important, and again, it’s a question on toe walking that I get all the time, and it’s like, let me throw this at you and now you’ve got something else to read and investigate and other solutions to try at home. So. So yes.  Whole Body Barefoot  solution. I love it. I’m so excited.', 'And the cover. And I love the cover. I think that this is the most beautiful book yet. What do you think?', 'I am.', 'I didn’t mean  that.', 'They are. Yeah.', 'That photo was a spontan – this was just a picture snapped of me while I was about to jump out of a tree.', 'It’s not like a posed photo, so I don’t – I just love it. But I meant, like, I like the – not my picture on the book. Just the cover. The cover, it’s dirt and it’s trees and it’s green, and I’ve got my favorite Unshoes on.', 'Actually, no, she didn’t do that.', 'No, a graphic designer laid all this out, and then there was this cool technical grid, if you look at it up close, like, I don’t know what it is but it’s all about body parts and communication and – I love  Zsofi  who does all of our graphic arts and stuff. And then on the back there’s this trail that’s all covered in rocks and dirt, and then of course, the colors. Like the green and the blue and the brown. I was going for a masculine kind of balance to the last pink and black and white, high-heeled cover, you know, for the foot book. So I feel like we’ve got nice bookends here.', 'Your husband included is in here!', '(audio unclear) comment.', 'Are you going to get him to autograph your book?', 'Well, didn’t you – I want to say something about the balls show but I just don’t think I will. Never mind.', 'I won’t!', 'Are you going to read the dedication? I’ll read the dedication.', 'Actually, Demi Moore recorded my audio book dedication, and it goes something like this: “For my feet, who have literally supported me through thick and thin, and ups and downs, and have gotten me to where I am today. Thank you.”', 'Hoo-yah!', 'All right.', 'All right, I’m going to go out and take a walk.', 'Yeah, they’re going to take me.']}\n",
      "{'DANI': ['Thank you. Thank you. KATY: And my favorite part is that you used the word booze in it. DANI: Because it rhymes with shoes! KATY: Your use of booze was genius! It was so – it was like the perfect segue, so anyway. I just wanted to, before we go into Katy Says, I just wanted to do a little bow of honor to what Dani says, because it was amazing. DANI: Well, that means quite a bit to me. Thank you much. All right, okay. When this episode comes out, we are right in the middle of Foot Health Awareness month. KATY: I know! It’s crazy! DANI: Crazy. But it is so exciting, because you have something going on every day this month. This is April when the show’s going to come out, so if you’re listening and we’re in April and we’re in the middle of Foot Health Awareness month, we’re going to actually be splitting into two, because there’s too much to talk about. KATY: Yeah, and we’re going to be answering all of the questions that came up on the board after  Whole Body Barefoot  came out and so this is kind of like the episode for the people. DANI: It is for the people, by the people, for the people. And it’s all about the base of your body. KATY: The base. Mm-hmm. DANI: The base. So feet are the foundation, and most folks that have found their way to your work found it looking for solutions to foot pain. And others who were looking for Restorative Exercise® to help with other health issues soon learned that they need to start with the feet, too. KATY: yeah. DANI: It’s all about the base. So you have written two books on foot health, and your latest, which I just – it’s awesome!  Whole Body Barefoot . KATY: Thank you. DANI: It’s out in stores, and online, and focuses on transitioning to minimal footwear and going barefoot. KATY: Yeah. DANI: And a lot more I mean, it’s just – it makes your feet feel better! So I’ve already gotten a response from the people that I lent my copy to, and it’s good. So this episode of the show we will be providing solutions and answers to barefoot and transitioning foot questions that, like you said, came up as soon as the presale copies were released.', 'And there were, like, 9 gajillion questions so we’ll have to make this long, like I said.', 'It is a lot of questions! And it took me forever to count! It took me like 10 gajillion minutes to count it. So we’ll just have to make it one really long one and we’ll split it in half. Can you digit?', 'There’s so many! Aw, there’s so many!', 'There’s so many. And for all the – just to kind of pre-empt those of you that have – there’s a lot of questions about what footwear for what situation. I will tell you right now:  Whole Body Barefoot  the book has an extensive list – not exhaustive – but extensive list of minimal footwear recommendations for men, women, and children in all seasons. So if you find something after reading that list that is not there, let us know, and we’ll put it in the 2 nd  printing, right? Is that what your plan is?', 'Wow!', 'All right. So let’s shoe it out of the gate.', 'Okay. And firstly, just so we all start off on the same foot: please briefly define, if you wouldn’t mind, what we’re going to consider minimal footwear for reference for this talk.', 'All right. So we’re all clear on that. Off on the same foot, let’s go.', 'You know what? I’ve been just dying – dying! - for today because the puns with feet: huge. Like, one of the best body parts for puns.', 'You don’t have to.', 'Ding, ding! All right. A punster gets their wings every time it happens. First question: most of us live around concrete. What about walking on concrete with minimal footwear? Are some shoes better than others, or what should be taken into consideration?', 'Excellent answer. Good job. This came up a lot for the second question: fat pads.', 'So –', 'Oh, come on, now. Don’t sound so arch. (ding!) So what, could you describe fat pads, and then – well, what are fat pads, first of all?', 'Mmm.', 'It would be cool if there was more information and studies about feet in their natural habitat. KATY: Yeah, but where are you supposed to go? Where do you go to find those? \\xa0 DANI: I know. I don’t know. Hey, will you do me a favor before we move on to the next question?', 'I need you to.', 'Thank you.', 'You goofball. Okay. Orthotics.', 'I have kind of a specific question, because that’s like a huge category. If –', 'Well, I’m just going to read this person’s question, is that all right? I won’t say their name.', 'No.', 'No. Ohh. This person: I have really stiff ankles and plantar fasciitis, bow legged and pronate a lot. So my chiro – that’s chiropractor – had me order orthotics to correct my pronation. The physical therapist, who I am now seeing, suggested I ditch the orthotics, because they treat the symptom and fail to correct the problem. That’s a pretty advanced PT. That’s cool. And he has me doing some exercises instead. I always wondered if orthotics were just a crutch that I would become dependent on, and I think my foot problems have only worsened since wearing them. Can you comment on the role of orthotics, please? That’s a real person’s question. I didn’t make it up. It’s real. It’s a good question, too, that’s why I put it in there.', 'Because a lot – that person is not alone in their situation. I wanted to read it.', 'Well, I hope that person’s listening. Great answer. Next question: good ol’ plantar fasciitis.', 'Good ol’ P.F. And that’s, by the way, how I first fell in love with your work, is I suffered from plantar fasciitis for two years. Two years! And after 3 weeks of starting a foot program with you, gone! So. A lot of people have it, and it’s kind of – a lot of people don’t talk about it, either. It’s just one of those weird things.', 'Yeah, but you wait – like, people come into my class for something else, and then they’ll tell me, oh, yeah, I get this real sharp pain in my heel when I get out of bed in the morning and it stays there for a few hours. It’s like, oh my gosh, you know? That’s not – that’s not something you want to live with! That’s, yeah. It’s not like a wrinkle. Okay. What differences are there when one is transitioning to minimal footwear if they have plantar fasciitis?', 'Or, is there? I mean, if I have plantar fasciitis, and I get  Whole Body Barefoot , I start doing the foot program and I’m thinking, okay, I’m ready. I mean, is there – I guess I’d like to know, is there anything – it wasn’t my question, actually – but is there anything that I would need to be more careful with if I had plantar fasciitis? Is that a better question?', 'Just say fat pads again.', 'Yes.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'It does. It does. You’ve done a toe-riffic job (ding!) of explaining it. KATY: Aw, toe-riffic. DANI: Nailed it! (ding!) Um, that was good. In fact, we just – you just got rid of the follow up. You got rid of the follow up question. You answered it. You’re ahead of me! That was really good.'], 'KATY': ['And my favorite part is that you used the word booze in it. DANI: Because it rhymes with shoes! KATY: Your use of booze was genius!

There’s a lot of foot puns. All right.', 'That’s actually going to be a call on the Facebook and Twitter feeds for – you know, there is a list for people listening, if you’re like, I’m ready for minimal shoes, you can go to my blog, KatySays.com and just search “shoes the list” and there’s also “shoes the winter list” and that includes men, women, and children’s shoes. That list has been kind of updated and organized a little bit differently. It’s in the back of  Whole Body Barefoot  but we’re also going to be doing a call this month for – there’s so many new shoe companies coming out all of the time. And so we want to, in our next print, which is going to be soon, because we almost sold out of our first two prints –', 'of  Whole Body Barefoot  we’ll be adding even more updated, exhaustive list. Because I only – I don’t – let’s answer the questions, because I think that, you know, I don’t even have that many shoes left. But everyone is looking for this perfect-for-whatever-your-scenario-is and it’s out there. I think you can find the minimal shoe that you’re looking for, once you know how to sort through shoes for which characteristics you might need right now.', '9 Gajillion. Let’s go.', 'Okay. So minimal footwear in the way that I use it, means footwear that disrupts your whole body movement as little as possible. That your gait as little as possible, so a big point that I went out of my way to make in  Whole Body Barefoot  is that flip-flops are often kind of deemed “minimal” shoes because there’s very little mass to the shoe, and because you’re exposed very much to the air. So that’s one way of defining a minimal shoe, you could say that it’s – you’re surrounded by material in a very little manner when you’re wearing a flip-flop. But the thing with the flip-flop is because it doesn’t attach fully to your foot, you end up having to alter different muscle use and joint actions to keep it on your foot. Because it’s not attached, you have to do work to keep it on, and that work is not limited to just the toes. It’s how you use the shin muscles, and how you hold the front of the foot very tense, and how tension that you have to do in your quadriceps and your hips. So it will – it changes the entire way that you walk, the rate that you walk, if you shuffle or not, etcetera. So it really is a whole body effect wearing something that you kind of have to grip your toes to keep on. So that would not be a minimal shoe. That’s just the one example. We can get into other characteristics, but that’s the easy – that’s the way that I am defining the term. So Vibram, on the other hand, fully covers your foot. So that’s what makes it different from being “barefoot,” so there is a disruption in loads to skin and nerves, however, you’re more biomechanical – your gross biomechanical variances and how you use your toes and your knees and your hips are not as disrupted, so that’s what I’m talking about today.', 'Oh, my god. You can’t help yourself!', 'I know. I know. I think that – I’m not going to be able to stop and give a nod of respect to every pun –', '-- but maybe we should have a little audio ding every time there’s a pun. Just in case it slipped by.', 'Well, what should be taken into consideration is if you’re wearing – if you’re going to minimal shoes, to use your whole body in a more natural way. Terrain is just as important as the shoe. So the terrain is a cast of sorts, so if you’re always walking on hard, flat, and level, then shoes have been providing a particular surface. So you have to 1) either include more natural terrain in what you’re walking on, even if you’re living in Manhattan, if you can find some not overly dog-crap-filled small pockets of grass along the sidewalk. If you can walk on something a little softer, a little more textured, a little bit more body-geometry altering, if you will. If you can’t do that too much, then you might want to consider a shoe that gives you a little bit of padding, you know, if you will. Something to dampen that repetitive, high-level of force. So I’m always just talking about walking; I’m never talking about athletic pursuits. I’m just talking about walking around for this discussion as mentioned in the book as well. So you have to consider your terrain just as much as you have to consider what you put on your feet, what you put your feet on. You have to think about both sides of the discussion.', 'Mm.', 'What’d you call me?', 'I mean – the quest – so I’ll sum up the question because I get the question a lot. So you have fat pads in your feet in different areas of your feet. You have lots of different padding mechanisms in your body. Things like bursae and fat pads are one of these tissues that you have that create a particular – they help create particular loads to different areas. You’re obviously, in nature you’d be on your feet quite a bit, and so you have a structure that helps you deal with that. Now what happens for a lot of people is when they go to walk barefoot as they’re older, keeping in mind that being older is also synonymous with, in this case, or could be said to be the same variable or as affected by the variable, spending many, many decades in shoes. So it’s hard to separate those two, meaning it doesn’t necessarily – we’re not necessarily talking about an age-related phenomenon as much as a movement history phenomenon, perhaps? And so you go to take off shoes and then you’re walking around your neighborhood on the cement, and then you’ll have metatarsal pain, or some sort of pain in your foot, and then you go to the doctor or you go to someone and they say, well, your fat pad is gone. And so you’ve broken it down, you’ve worn you and your shoes your whole entire life have worn through your fat pad. So there are fat pads – there’s not very much information out on fat pads as it relates to foot health. There’s very little information on foot health meaning in their natural – like, what is the natural state of the foot? There’s very little information about that. But the really only piece they have to talk about fat pads would be that the geometry of a fat pad, the size – like, the shape, the thickness and the location of the fat pad – is affected by things like neuropathy and hammer toes and clawed toes. So in exactly the same way like we talk about everything else: you are how you move, the state of your health now is also affecting the health of your fat pad. So you could have a fat pad missing in a particular area, but you also have muscle and bone and nerve health missing in those areas as well. And so in the larger message it doesn’t really change: we want you to change the shape and the location and the heath of your fat pad by doing all the same things that we’re doing for the health and the shape and the fitness for your other feet parts: your bones and your nerves. That being said, if you are missing a fat pad, if you’ve displaced it or smooshed it down or whatever through the way that you’ve moved, you would want to not be exposing your foot to high load, repetitious use, especially on something hard. You know, your fat pad – the forces created between your foot and the surface will be greater depending on the stiffness of the surface and also the geometry your foot assumes while you’re walking over it. So as you change your geometry and the strength of your foot, you will be changing where you press through your feet when you’re walking. Like, none of those things are actually fixed. If you don’t have a fat pad in the area where you need it right now for comfort, then the shoe is what you’re using it for. That’s why minimal shoes come in so many different categories, and maybe for you the variable that you would focus on is eliminating the heel, not necessarily eliminating the cushion. So you could go through – for something that has a bit of squish to it as you are doing all these other things to strengthen your feet. Because this is not a discussion about – this is not a discussion only about what shoes should I put on in the morning? It’s also about how well you tend to your feet. The shoe is a small part: your gait pattern and the strength and the function of your foot is a much larger piece. They’re certainly related, but rather than going, “Oh, Katy says wear minimal shoes,” and then just putting them on, I would rather you walk around in your old shoes while doing your foot exercises.', 'So – so that’s all I have to say about fat pads. Love ‘em! Fat pads, love ‘em!', 'Yeah, but where are you supposed to go? Where do you go to find those?', 'No.', 'Ok, yes.', 'Fat pads.', '(echo effect) Fat pads. Thank you to our new audio tech, Brock, for that echo. That was just amazing.', 'Mmm.', 'Shoot.', 'Do it. Is it your husband?', 'Okay. Okay, good.', 'It is.', 'Well, I mean – I think that – I think I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: orthotics, orthotics are a – they’re a solution to a very narrow portion of the problem. And there’s a section of orthotics, really in both books, in the old foot book I had, like, why does someone wear orthotics or need orthotics and the second book actually our favorite podiatrist commented – she’s like, here’s what I’m giving orthotics for. I’m giving orthotics to change the load to your ankles and your knees and your hips that without the orthotics will damage your ankles and your knees and your hips. It’s to make you more comfortable. However, the reason you need orthotics is because of weakness in your ankles and your knees and your hips, and so I can only do so much. I can give you the exercises, you need to do them. You need to think about all of these other things. So if you’re wearing orthotics, orthotics are supporting a portion of the problem. But they’re also supporting – as in promoting – a portion of the problem, which is the weakness. Like, they don’t make you stronger, they just kind of shove your bones into a particular place and so we know enough in physiology that passive positioning is not the same thing as active positioning. So if – like I always use the bicep. If you’re holding on to a weight and you do a bicep curl, if you move your arm from dropped down by your side and flex it and pull it up, you will see the muscle bulge, right? So your bicep is getting shorter, but it’s also because it’s generating force, getting thicker. It’s pushing out to the sides. So there’s this motion of the bicep due to its activity, its muscular force-generating activity. Now put that same arm down, and now lift the arm up with your opposite hand. The joint action is the same in both cases, but in one case you use muscle, and in the other case you didn’t use the muscle of that arm. Musculo-skeletal rearrangement can be active or passive. Passive musculo-skeletal rearrangement does not do a body good in the long term, in that it does not bring about strength or the situation in the tissues that is brought about by you using the muscles to do it. So that’s all we’re saying. You can slap on an orthotic and get a particular joint configuration, but that joint configuration is passive, and it’s still collapsing, although it’s collapsing in a new geometry. Or you can get the same effect as you can get with an orthotic from your own muscles, which is what you want. Because then you have the better loading of your ankles, knees, and hips and you are using your own muscle to do it, so it’s stable. It comes with all the things that come with more muscle use: better metabolism, better bone density, more stability. And so this is just not looking for a muscle or body enhancement pill, this is you just doing the work that is inevitable, because these things don’t tend to – like, things like orthotics and support, they don’t tend to do their job over a long period of time, or they’ll kind of push the problem outside of the local area to another area above or below. So that’s – that’s what I have to say about orthotics, but also: if you are wearing orthotics, you clearly need some structural support, which is why it’s so important to transition. Do you just take them off? Do you just take the orthotics off and start doing the exercises, or do you do the exercises over time until the orthotic becomes noticeable and slightly uncomfortable because now it’s interfering with your muscles doing the work? So it’s all about this gradual transition. So. Final answer.', 'Good ol’ plantar fasciitis.', 'Really? Because I hear people talk about it all the time.', 'Well, I don’t know if I understand questions like that. The whole – like, everything –', 'No, it’s not, really. It’s the same question.', 'Fat pads. It’s – this is why I wrote that section in the beginning of  Whole Body Barefoot  about water. Do you remember that section about water?', 'Okay, so I’ll just explain it. So you guys don’t even have to buy the book, you can just listen to this podcast. I’m just going to read the book, how about I just – just do the book and we’ll call this podcasted audio version of  Whole Body Barefoot?  When the analogy that I’m using is writing a book on water. So I’m just writing this book on water, and I say that everyone needs, you know, 8 glasses of water a day. Or it would be better to say, we need this much water per this mass of your body, so that everyone can adjust the quantity just so to their particular body. Because if you don’t get your water, here’s a list of 87 ailments that are correlated to a lack of water. And then, so you read this whole book and you get this understanding, then you’re like, but I didn’t see my issue X or my issue Y or my issue Z. It’s like, well, the way that I’m writing, the argument that I’m presenting is: this is the, this is the requirement to figure out what you need exactly. Just subtract how much water you’re actually drinking from the baseline of water that a human needs. So you have to do a little bit of legwork (ding!) to figure out – thank you – you have to do a little bit of your own legwork to figure out what it is that you need specifically. How you need to modify – I mean, the exercises are all – the exercises are all there. These are all movements to restore the strength. If you have plantar fasciitis, what you have is a situation of inflammation due to using one structure too much in your body and not using other structures. So I assume that everyone who is starting to transition has a problem with their foot. I assume that, because why else would you? That’s most people’s motivation is discomfort somewhere.', 'I assume an injured population for what I’m writing, which is why I go through so many pains to explain the need to transition slowly. So if someone has plantar fasciitis and says, “I tried to wear Vibrams and it hurts,” or, “I have orthotics and I tried to wear, you know, a flat shoe but it hurts my Achilles tendon,” it’s like, yes, I know all of those things, which is why I do not recommend that you start your transition to minimal shoes by actually wearing them. That the transition to minimal shoes is changing your whole body alignment and the corrective exercises and how much you sit and whatnot because the shoes themselves – the ones that you are used to wearing right now – while they have created the issues or the ailments or the symptoms of wearing them, they also support that level of symptoms and ailments. So, like, that’s – you’ve adapted. Your ailment, your plantar fasciitis is the result of using your body in a particular way. But you have to, like, slowly retreat out of that way, rather than jump away from the way that you’ve used them. So I don’t think that having plantar fasciitis – what tends to happen is, like, people, they don’t understand step-wise very well. They’ll hear me say it and they’re like, yeah, I know, I took baby steps. But they didn’t really take baby steps. They put on a new shoe and then they went and hiked for 4 miles in that new shoe without – because they don’t think about loads all the time, it’s like, you – say if you do 5 miles a day in your old hiking boots. What would be an appropriate step to start transitioning to minimal footwear? Well, it would not be wearing minimal shoe for one mile of that 5 mile hike, or if you wanted to do it that way, after wearing minimal shoes for that 1 mile hike and experiencing the pain, that was a signal that that was too large of a loop, and maybe it would have been better to just start with some corrective exercises, and then go on to your old 5 mile hike in your old shoes. And then maybe it’s go on your 5 mile hike in your old shoes but then think about your alignment while you’re walking; are you always toes and knees and chest and body forward where the pressure on your forefoot, the front of your foot, is so high that you’ve walked 5 miles on the front of your foot? How about you practice just wearing your old shoes but walking 5 miles where you’re stacked more on the back of the foot and giving the tissues in the front of the foot a break? So I think that you have all of the information in the books to be able to break down your progression into small enough steps for you and whatever ailment you are experiencing right now. Does that make sense at all? DANI: It does. It does. You’ve done a toe-riffic job (ding!) of explaining it. KATY: Aw, toe-riffic. DANI: Nailed it! (ding!) Um, that was good. In fact, we just – you just got rid of the follow up. You got rid of the follow up question. You answered it. You’re ahead of me! That was really good. \\xa0 KATY: I just clipped it (ding!)

Do young, as in like 5 and 7, around that age, kids need to transition to minimal?', 'If they are going to be, you know, do they need a transition period when they’re so young?', 'Brilliant idea!', 'Are.

No, I – and so, she’s a nurse, she has to go off and work or whatever.', 'Yeah, but I have a new walking buddy every day!

You may have to shave a few seconds off that song.', 'Yup. All right. Well, just pick the good parts, Brock.', 'My song, my ditty! Okay. Here is a question from a reader – I will read her question. She has transitioned from wearing orthotics and then she went to running shoes, now she’s wearing no orthotics and she’s into negative heel shoes, some flats, and some barefoot, all the way barefoot. She’s always barefoot outside in her yard, in her house she has hard, ceramic floors with mats at the stove and sink or whatever, and she’s wondering if it’s okay to go barefoot on such hard surfaces.', 'Thank you.', 'It’s a good one. Thank you. Okay. A zero-rise shoe, like an old Converse Chuck Taylor – well, it doesn’t have to be old, but the old style Converse. One of the fellas measured the insert in it and found that it was 5-6mm and he wondered if that’s enough rise to throw off the geometry.', 'Right.', 'Well, that is the question.', 'It was, and it’s only Tuesday, so.', 'You’re going to have to sing something from the ‘80s, too, so you’re going to have to think on that.', 'Yeah. Yeah. I’ll give you time to warm up.', 'Okay.', 'I thought you were going to say put them both on at once. That doesn’t make any sense. Yes, cycle through them. You’re right.', 'Were they totally different? Like, same style, or?', 'Okay. Arches, am I right? Lots of people worry about arch support, like, not having it. And in  Whole Body Barefoot  does a great job of explaining the arch structure and how to strengthen the arches, but one of the questions we got was, can my unshod arches and heels take hard wood floor or should I wear something with more support? So. Really, you technically already answered that question elsewhere.', 'But a lot of people don’t know that.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yes.', 'Thank you.', 'Um, what would you recommend, and I’m not asking for shoes suggestions, but what would you recommend for folks who cannot wear appropriately minimal footwear, like people in industrial situations? Um, for work. Like, I worked for UPS for maybe a hard 3 months once, and I had to wear shoes – they wouldn’t let me wear, like, my Converse Chuck Taylors. You know, like – that’s my toe protection! They’re like, no, so I had to wear these big, old steel-toed –', '--hunkin things and at the end of the day my back would just be like, (makes noise) but some folks just can’t. So what is your – and I think I know your answer for this, what is your prescription for them?', 'So he knew what was best for him.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'What?', 'Yes. Or even the show description at some point during this month of podcasts.', 'Because we’re going to have a work day, right?', 'A professional day. That was good. Well, I just quit my job. I didn’t like my shoes, so.', 'Okay. If a beloved activity is particularly hard on your feet, like roller skate or soccer with their pointy little shoes, is compensating with the exercises in the program and minimal footwear the rest of the time good enough? I mean, is it – you keep – you don’t have to worry about what you’re doing to your feet, which I guess is kind of the same thing as working.', 'Oh, man!', 'Right.', 'Right.', 'Like turkey trots, you know? The turkey trots every Thanksgiving. Everybody’s like, I’m going to sign up for my 5K so I can go eat Thanksgiving dinner.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yeah. That’s what I do with roller skates. I love my skating, but I have to do foot exercises after to make sure my toes don’t feel too smushed.', 'Well, speaking of soccer, that’s actually one of the questions, and I know you could possibly speak to this, since your husband is a super duper soccer guy.', 'Really? I’ve been calling him the wrong name all this time! How embarrassing. Well, just tell him I follow people in the woods and he’ll know that I’m a loon.', 'Following me? Calling me something different than Super Soccer Guy? So cleats – are they necessary? Because a lot of kids, it’s soccer season right now, and adults still like to play soccer. Can you speak to that from his perspective, or what he’s learned? Are cleats necessary for playing the game of soccer?', 'Yes.', 'You know, I never thought about that.', 'No!', 'Super Soccer Guy?', 'Oooh, I cannot wait! Okay, two more quick questions. Hammer toes: do they ever straighten back out if somebody quits the input that created them in the first place?', 'Cool. Well, that’s going to make that person happy that asked that. Okay.', 'Well, no. That’s what I have, and I’m really uncomfortable right now. But –', 'I can’t eat a donut with my feet, though. You’re going to have to feed me one with yours.', 'Um, okay. I didn’t ask this, but boy do I want to know the answer.', 'So – washable minimals, like Vibram Five Fingers tend to fall apart when washed multiple times. Do you personally, Katy Bowman, have any tips for keeping the stink off them? KATY: Really? I’ve washed mine many times. So maybe 1) put them on a gentle setting, right? So if you’re throwing them in an aggressive setting, I’m not sure what multiple times means – multiple could mean anywhere from 4 to 400. But this was the tip that I got a long time ago with Vibrams, and what I’ve always used is to soak them with an Alka Seltzer. That the effervescent breaks it up. \\xa0 DANI: The effervescent action breaks it up.', 'Well, then that makes sense because they’re not getting pulled.', 'Right. KATY: It’s the agitation that would break them up, so baking soda, hydrogen peroxide soak, rinse them out with water, and then the key is you have to not wear them long enough where everything that feeds on animal matter dies. So just a personal story: I went kayaking in my Vibrams and fell out of my kayak within seconds. Maybe a minute. I’ll give myself a minute, just like – and so I stepped in, um, really life-filled water. Like, the water was very – it was up here, so just lots of – \\xa0 DANI: Sea spooge.', 'Oh, no.', 'That’s like a science experiment right there.', 'Were they toast, or were you able to recover them?', 'Another science experiment.', 'Yeah.', 'That was great.', 'Yeah. I’ll write in. I’ll write it right now. Thank you, that helps.', 'That’s a pretty good tip, actually.', 'No!', 'I have several pair but I cycle through, so.', 'Okay, well, I don’t want to be a heel, (ding!) but we’re out of time.', 'I have.

Thanks, everyone, for listening.'], 'KATY': ['Podcast-itis.', 'Thanks! You’re welcome!', 'You mean should they be wearing minimal shoes?', 'Not so much. Not so much. However, the transition period – because they’re very supple, they’re supple and their tissues are in a different state and they’re light and low to the ground, so they don’t – if you imagine, if you think of your foot, all of our feet are still in their infant stages for people who have been, like, sitting the bulk of the time. If you’ve logged so many miles over your whole entire life, and then you look at, you know, what a child – how many unshod miles you’ve logged on your feet, kids just don’t have – they don’t have the resistance in their tissues as much as we do. Nor do they have the heavy loads, because they don’t – their weight is still pretty light of what they’re carrying on their feet. That all being said, because I get this question a lot about kids, is foot position and turnouts and turn-ins and strength and arch height is affected more by more than just what shoes they’ve worn. It’s again, it’s how much did they sit on the couch, how much do they walk a day, and all of those things are they’re usually sitting way too much and they’re usually walking way too less and I’m not talking about how much exercise they get, and I’m not talking about how much they play outside. I’m talking about how many miles have they walked forward on natural terrain in their bare feet without tissues that have adapted to car seats and buckets and couches and televisions – all of that is affecting their foot health as well. Foot health is whole body. You know what? We should name that book,  Whole Body Barefoot.', 'Yeah. So, so think about, you know, if you’re kind of going, I don’t know, kids’ feet are again, it’s a whole body, whole lifestyle issue, feet health is. Are.', 'Feet health are?', 'This is going to be tricky.', 'Okay, sing it.', 'Yes.', 'When you start singing? Oh, oh, okay.', 'You know, it’s not a walking buddy if you didn’t make a pre-arranged meeting to walk. If you’re just following someone around, technically that’s not a walking buddy.', 'Ee- go ahead.', 'Wow, this new podcast, Dani Sings, is rad.', 'It’s pretty good. Do we have to pay a licensing fee now?', 'It’s like the Happy Birthday Song in movies, they only play, like, “to you!” and that’s it.', 'It’d be a very short show. He’s like, I edit it down to 7 and a half minutes, ladies.', 'I mean, is it okay? It’s your comfort, it’s your comfort level. It sounds like she’s getting enough barefoot time elsewhere, you know, trying to stay objective. It’s hard, because we all feel like, oh, I get plenty of – it’s like, but how much? People say, oh, I get plenty of fat in my diet, and it’s like, how much? How about just give me the numbers, not your interpretation of ‘plenty.’ Yes, hard surfaces – hard, flat surfaces are unnatural environments so things like socks, or if you want to wear something in the house that gives you a little bit of cushion, especially if you notice discomfort from flat and level. But a lot of times it’s not just walking on your flat – through your house, it’s standing. So standing in one place is an unnatural movement. So standing at your work desk is not natural. Or standing to cook, or cut. I notice that if I’m working at the counter for a long period of time, your feet can start to ache when they’re bare, which is why those cushions in front of where you occupy your most time are helpful on your feet. So yeah, I think that that is definitely a valid point that needs to be part of this minimal shoe discussion that seems to end where the shoe ends and you’re not considering the environment or the context that you’re putting your foot in if it’s hard and flat and uncomfortable then modify it by making it a little softer. Either by slipping something onto your foot – you know, that doesn’t affect the motion of your foot – or standing on basically different versions of fatigue mats, or anti-fatigue mats. Your folded cloth in front of your kitchen sink or wherever you spend time, or your standing work desk.', 'And that question can go for all of you who have standing workstations who wonder the same thing. It’s all the – it’s the same answer.', 'Well, the thing about geometry – if there’s a value there that’s greater than the other side of the shoe, that changes your geometry, right? That’s not my opinion, that’s just math. Like, if it’s not zero and it’s 1, it’s a different geometry.', 'So – so but maybe the question is, is it too much?', 'Yeah. Your bo-again, in the book, there’s nothing wrong with having your heel positioned above your toe. You can go downhill, right? It’s a perfectly natural position; it’s just the frequency of it is not natural. If you’re wearing your Chuck Taylors – or I used to have purple Converse, how about you? Converse were my first pair of shoes that came in a box that I chose because it was my desire to have purple high top Converse. Just a little bit of, like, that’s a throwback Thursday right there.', 'Well, make sure you release this on a Thursday so it’s in context.', 'Can I do it in a little bit?', 'So for the Converse, it’s not – it’s not too much. I mean, that’s a nice, small amount. Just making sure that your program – you’re thinking bigger than your shoe. How much of just that 4-5mm do you ever get to experience in the other direction? Like, how much uphill are you doing?', 'You’re just trying to train all of your body. That’s all this is about. All this is about, especially with the geometry argument of the heel is that you neglect certain ranges of motion in your body, so just make sure that you vary up your surface, so that you do some uphill walking where you get some dorsiflexion that you’re spending some time walking up and downhill without any sort of rise, even if it’s tiny. Or constantly varying rise, you know? Or if you’ve got 2 pairs of shoes, cycle through 2 pairs of shoes. At least you’re cross training a little bit, you know?', 'One day I wore two different shoes to school because I was trying them on with my outfit: which one am I going to wear? And then I was at school, my senior year in high school, before I realized I had two different shoes on.', 'I don’t – I actually can’t remember what shoes they were. It wasn’t that big of a deal, because I wasn’t – I just noticed at like 1:00 in the afternoon, so it wasn’t a huge, but still.', 'Yeah, there is no arch in your – I mean, the arch is just a shape.', 'They do not know, no. There is no – no, if you cut out, there is no arch bone in your body. There is no arch structure. Arch is a position of your foot that is created, um, through – it’s like space, it’s like a void, it’s like a donut hole. The donut hole only exists because of the donut around it. And frankly, I’m craving a donut right now, I don’t know if you are. But we eat it with our feet, so it’d be okay. Um, your – the same thing with your arch, but – your arch is going to be, again, a dynamic. The amount of arch changes as you stroll over your foot, so really an arch is not a fixed end point. It’s strength in the feet to support not only the rest of the weight and the parts above you, but to support ever-changing loads through moving all of the time. We are not after this end shape of “high” or “low” or “just right.” You are after – you are after a body that facilitates movement well. The end. And then movement, meaning all the way down onto a cellular level. You are trying to move well! You are trying to accomplish all of your tasks including the biological ones, so your arches are not going to collapse. If your arches collapse as soon as you take your shoe off, then we are having an orthotic joint position situation, meaning that you don’t have any strength in your own body to maintain the position of your body that the external support has been doing the work. You’ve been outsourcing your body’s work to the device. You remove the device and the body collapses. So we don’t want that – we want the opposite of that. Or we want that outcome in a different way, we want to have, you want to have a strong enough foot that doesn’t automatically translate to an arch of a certain height, but there are definite parameters of foot position and arch position that should be there at rest, that kind of correlate well to someone who does or does not have foot health or knee health or hip health or whatever’s migrating away from the base issue, or root issue, if you will. So it’s not bad on – your hardwood floors are not a foot health destroyer, it’s only if that’s the only environment you expose your feet to. You know, instead of focusing on this small percentage of the surface of your house – like, the surface of your house is your cage. Don’t think about your foot health being made so much inside your cage. You’re going to have to get out of your cage and you’re going to have to get out of your foot cage, the shoe, and your house cage, and interact with some more movement. The portion of that movement can be done within your cage, right? Because you are the zookeeper, you’re trying to come up with some exercises to give your little caged tigers, to keep them happy, to get them a little bit of exercise, but that is like step 1 in terms of thinking about it. Step 2 is thinking about, like, how would this tiger be if it wasn’t even in this cage? So you’re trying to re-introduce your feet into the wild. There’s a cage protocol, we’ve got that for you, but then we’ve got the slowly spending a little bit more time in the wild with your wild cousin, you know, and then coming back in, sleeping in your cage until you slowly develop the senses, and then we’ll reintroduce you, and it could take 20 years or it could take, I mean, who knows how long it takes? There’s very few people who have done the full transition into the wild, year-round or whatnot.', 'But we’re all just making steps. (ding!) You’ve still got to keep the big picture in mind, and yes, your zoo environment is affecting your health, but I wouldn’t focus so much on that, because unless you’re going to rip out the floors of your house, it’s better to focus on the things that you can change which are the frequency with which you do your exercises and take your feet out.', 'in every way possible.', 'You’re welcome.', 'Steel-toed, yeah.', 'Well, okay, so the first thing is: if your – if it is totally impossible for you to change shoes, then don’t worry about the time it’s totally impossible for you to change shoes, and change everything else that you do all of the other time, okay? So your foot exercises have nothing to do with your shoes that you wear at work, it’s a completely separate issue, so do that. And then make sure you’re in whatever minimal you can stand right now all of the other time. You could quit your job, you know, or – what this guy, this is very funny. When  Whole Body Barefoot  the books ship from the printer, they ship to my house, because we actually mailed all the presales out here – we actually packaged up 1,000 books and labeled them and walked them to the post office one load at a time. So the guy backed up – so it was a huge freight truck with stuff on pallets. It’s not UPS, it’s not FedEx, it’s freight. And so they actually had miniature forklifts. So he came out and was like, there’s a lot of authors that live out here! He’s like, I deliver all these books – and you know, it’s a pallet with cases of books stacked on top – and I was like, really, where? And he was like, over here, and I was like, yeah, that was my old house. And he was like, oh, it turns out there’s one author out here! So just from my old house – he was like, was your mom accepting your books? And I was like, yeah, we were out of town. But anyway! Long story to say that he – he said, let me see these books, so he cracked them open, and he’s like, look at my shoes! And he pulled up his shoe and he had essentially like a Converse. He was like, these are so flat and flexible. He said, I’m not allowed to wear these for work, so I wear the other ones in where I load my truck, and then, he said, when I go out on the road he just leaves and does his deliveries, he said I put these on my feet because I know the rules and I’m not going to sue anyone for anything, but my knees and my back and my feet would ache at the end of every day.', 'So not to break the rules – well, the thing is: there are rules, and you understand why the rules are there. And he was willing to accept personal responsibility for his health, and he did it. So there’s that.', 'There’s also – there’s also a pair of steel-toed tennis shoes now on the market', 'which might have been – so, I just sent a link – I just sent a link to someone. It’s not like a Sketcher or whatever. It’s like some New Balance or some, like, mainstream tennis shoe company that is now making steel toe. So, boom. That might be your solution right there. And we’ll see, maybe we can put it in the show notes if we can find it.', 'Yes, we will absolutely – we will absolutely post it.', 'A professional day!', 'Oh, there you go.', 'It sounds a lot like my brother, who likes to run after he’s done smoking because he swears that – that his endurance training is offsetting the damage to his lungs brought about by smoking. Like, that’s his health program. He’s like, I love to smoke so I started to run. And now, I run, and he feels okay about smoking. He still has lung problems, but he’s an excellent runner. So of course, so yeah. I always like to throw out a ridiculous – like where everyone would be like, that’s ridiculous. The body does not work that way, it’s like you just kind of binged on crème brulee so you’re going to eat a salad to balance what you just consumed as dessert.', 'It’s all input. You do not remove input. Right?', 'I just want to make sure everyone understands that basic physiological guideline. You do not want to think about ‘balancing out’ one behavior with another, because it does not work that way. You don’t binge eat and then go jog it off. Although we do, right? We say that all the time.', 'So we’re thinking – because we think in those terms, because magazine articles are presented like, this workout is worth this many calories, so if you overindulge, make sure you do this workout so that your net energy is zero. It’s like – what is going on right now in the world?', 'Yeah, well, and it’s not to say that – you know, large bouts of – I mean, we even try to offset sedentary with active, right? So you just –', 'So the sedentary was input just like the active. The toes smushed together was input just like the toes spreading. That all being said, if you – you have to also, what you do have to balance is the enjoyment of your life. You know, if foot health is so bad, whatever ailment that you have is so bad that you can’t enjoy your day-to-day activities, then it would make sense to cut back on the activities that are causing you to not enjoy other aspects of your life. That being said, if you can’t imagine enjoying your life without activity X, then you understand and negotiate some sort of sacrifice. Keeping in mind, though, that the enjoyment of your life is going to be broader, perhaps, than the next 2 weeks. You know, so sometimes we have a hard time looking past 2 weeks. That all being said – I’ve said, “that all being said” a lot of times – that all being said, you don’t know when your life is going to be over! So is it better to play it safe through your entire life, never doing the things that would cause some sort of – I mean, are you worried so much about protecting your health that you never do anything with it? So it’s a very big philosophical question about your life. So if someone is going, this plantar fasciitis won’t go away, and I don’t take walks with my children and I don’t go outside into nature and all these other things that I want to do, but I can muster up enough foot whatever to play my game of soccer or to go rock climbing – I’m just thinking of, like, really tight shoes or whatever – then those are – that’s a question for yourself. You can also play around with it. If you’ve been playing soccer – I’m just using soccer as an example – if you’re playing soccer and your feet and your back are killing you after every game and it takes a few days to recover, and you don’t get to do other things – play around with the exercises. And if the exercises, doing them before and after a few times for the week allow you to play soccer and have healthy feet, then boom, you just found your solution.', 'Yeah.', 'Um, that’s actually his name.', 'He’s like, Dani’s been walking with me every morning, it’s really weird, like 12 feet behind me?', 'Well, that answer is easy to find an objective answer to by finding any example of any people who play soccer without cleats, which you could do easily on YouTube. People play soccer all over the world without cleats. Correct?', 'So –', 'Yeah, it’s like, you have to – many times you can answer your own question just by thinking about it yourself for a second, and trying to find any example that answers that question with a resounding, “Yes!” or, “No!” Just one example, and then you begin to refine your question. I think as there are children – I mean, soccer is a global phenomenon – and the ability to afford soccer cleats is not a global phenomenon, and many people play soccer. The best soccer players are actually – globally – tend to be those who played barefoot for a very long period of time. Because, of course, what do you end up getting? Stronger feet, knees, and ankles. Better skills, better sensory input, etc. They’re just – if you have street kids and village kids playing in dirt piles in whatever they can and playing extremely well, certainly compared to, say, me. But – so no, they’re not required, but they’re going to be “required” by any club that you’re in. So my basic – we have kids, because of Super Duper Soccer Player, which is my husband’s name. Our children also “play soccer” meaning you – they get the development of the skills and the trapping and passing but they’ve never once done it with shoes on, because they don’t so any real movement activities with shoes on. So they’re already playing – they’re already playing family soccer and kicking and passing and all that stuff doesn’t happen with shoes. So that could be a really cool, fun thing, is let’s play barefoot soccer. That’s a really great way to introduce unshod motion and family time is just to go take a soccer ball out to a field, right? Because fields tend to not be full of broken – broken – like, an actual sport field. And just play a family game! Like, what are your skills like? You know, you’re not doing – you’re not running, I’m not saying go out and play with a bunch of aggressive players where you’re doing a lot more agility moves where suddenly getting rid of your shoe would be huge. But if you’re already playing and your kids are already playing, just go out and start kicking the ball around and having these little kind of fun, low pace, low skill games. Low challenge, and boom, there was your barefoot time. So, there’s that. But cleats – you know, cleats are a part of the shoe end. If everyone else has cleats on, you certainly want to be wearing cleats if you want to be competitive because everyone’s going to have a traction advantage on you as well as you don’t want to get stepped on –', '--your bare foot with cleats on. But I am also going to reveal what my husband did with his soccer cleats – to his soccer cleats.', 'What Super Soccer Guy did to his soccer cleats because he can no longer wear a positive heel. He’s like, it’s like shoving a stick up my spine to go play on the field where before he would just play really hard and then have raging back pain. Like, he would throw out his back every game. He’s a phenomenal player and has played for decades, but his game would jack him up in his 20s and his 30s and now he’s back to playing now, but I’ll reveal a post and a picture about that. You can check out my blog or the Facebook page and I’ll give you a hint. It involves a knife.', 'We have. We’ve had a lot of people who have had their hammer or curly toes change. So yeah, it’s just a soft tissue change, yeah?', 'Or did you mean toes that were made out of hammers?', 'No, but your carpentry skills are amazing.', 'I can pound it into oblivion!', 'Oh, jeez.', 'Really? I’ve washed mine many times. So maybe 1) put them on a gentle setting, right? So if you’re throwing them in an aggressive setting, I’m not sure what multiple times means – multiple could mean anywhere from 4 to 400. But this was the tip that I got a long time ago with Vibrams, and what I’ve always used is to soak them with an Alka Seltzer. That the effervescent breaks it up.', 'Yeah. And what did we always used to do here? We would soak – we would soak them – the washing would be soaking them with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. So we didn’t actually wash them, I guess we would just – just, uh –', 'Right, they’re not getting agitated.', 'It’s the agitation that would break them up, so baking soda, hydrogen peroxide soak, rinse them out with water, and then the key is you have to not wear them long enough where everything that feeds on animal matter dies. So just a personal story: I went kayaking in my Vibrams and fell out of my kayak within seconds. Maybe a minute. I’ll give myself a minute, just like – and so I stepped in, um, really life-filled water. Like, the water was very – it was up here, so just lots of –', 'Yeah, it was full of splooge. Then I wore them for the five-mile walk home. So then you feed it, feed it, and then I put them in a bag. I put them in a bag.', 'I put them in a plastic bag, and then flew home, because it was before I lived here, probably 7 or 8 years ago. And, um.', 'It was! Oh my god, so when I took them out of the bag like 30 hours later they smelled like I had stuffed them with – with – bloated, dead cattle, which is the only smell that I’ve actually been behind a truck of bloated, dead cattle. Yay, for living in the valley of California! And that’s what it smelled like – cow – it was awful.', 'Well, like many things that I’m going to do, I just put them in – like, in a bucket, in a dry bucket on my porch for like a year and a half, and –', 'Well, everything in there will die. It needs to be fed. The only reason it’s smelling is because it’s alive. So once you’ve stopped feeding it, then it all dies out and then they were fine. And so that’s – if you could have shoes in general, when you wear multiple shoes – like if you have a pair of shoes that you wear every single day, you will wear through that pair of shoes faster than if you have two of the same pair of shoes using them every other day. Because there’s a recovery period of time for a shoe that allows it to kind of regain its form back – and it seems like it shouldn’t be, like, logically it’s like, who cares? There’s a certain amount of miles, because loading rate has an impact: recovery time, dry out time. You begin to change other character – other characteristics of a shoe that affect its function. And the easiest way to explain this is like, time is one of those. So if you have a couch and you put your couch on the carpet, it smashes the carpet down, right? So when you move your couch after your couch being there, like you’re going to vacuum every 3 months under your couch, when you slide your couch there’s divots there. But if you just put your couch on for a day or a few minutes and took it off, even though it’s the exact same weight, the exact same shape, the deformation to the carpet is different, yes? Have you ever experienced that?', 'Great. So time is another variable. So recovery time for your shoes – not just your body, but for your shoes – if you can cycle through a couple pairs of Vibrams it would, of course, require that you can invest in a couple pairs, or if you have one really old pair that you keep around just for the recovery day or days of your other shoe it wouldn’t matter if they were wet. After you’ve washed them, let them fully dry before putting them on or else you’re going to create a stank environment a lot faster. So that would be my Martha Stewart tips.', 'For stinky Vibrams.', 'Surprisingly enough, she hasn’t covered that on her blog.', 'Okay, good.', 'Was that your husband’s question?', 'Okay, good.', 'Good.', 'You’ve been waiting all day to use that pun.', 'Yeah, well, he’s going to give us some serious help, because we used to record this just in a closet, it sounded like, in our house in a closet.

Instead of just going out and climbing a tree, well, if I’d been sitting at my desk for 8 years, that’s not going to work for me to go out and climb a tree at first, you know. I have to get some movement in my shoulder girdle and build up some strength, and that’s kind of how I – I use the stuff that you teach is to get me to a place where I don’t have to worry if I have to scramble up a rock when I’m hiking, because I know I’ve got that mobility now to do that without tearing something in my shoulder.', 'Well, I don’t think – I mean I just think of it as, like, play.', 'Well, I also want to be able to pull myself up a tree if a zombie’s chasing me, too.', 'Off the record?', 'Yeah.

It’s not what we have to worry about.', 'Yeah.', 'Yes.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Mm-hmm.'], 'KATY': ['Yeah.', 'No.', 'No, exercise is not bad.', 'It’s huge.', 'No, you know, I think approaching it like that – so in  Move Your DNA  I tried to write it out, you know, the differences between movement and exercise, right? So it’s very large. It’s nothing to be – summing it up is the problem. Let me – let me – gosh.', 'You know, it’s the summation is where all of the content is lost by the buzzwords, and the buzzwords really can’t contain this larger idea. But, so I think that – let me just talk through it because I’m good at just talking.', 'Well, I’m a talker, whether I’m good at it again. You know, the company that I have is the Restorative Exercise™, right? It’s a system, it’s taught through the Restorative Exercise™ Institute. So clearly exercise is not bad or else I probably wouldn’t have put it in my business name, right? I wouldn’t have put it in the Institute’s name. I wouldn’t have included exercise sections in all of my books, right?', 'So it’s not bad. It’s just – I’m trying to define what it  is.  And how it compares to something that is called movement. And so I think – I’ve already labored very heavily in summing it up in  Move Your DNA  and whatnot, so you can – if you’re interested in more depth the differences, you can go refer to those. But in general, movement is any change in position of your body, but exercise would be those changes in the position of our body that we do for the purpose of reaping a particular health outcome. So when you think about exercise, exercise has variables. Exercise – there’s a science of exercise, and it means that it’s something that you’re isolating, that you’re selecting out and you’re saying how long you’re going to do it, how hard or fast you’re going to do it, the mode of which you’re going to partake of your exercise: you know, is it running or cycling, is it Zumba or Nia, or is it a walk or whatever, you know. Is it a walk on natural terrain? You know, that is still exercise, right? Because you are doing it for the purpose of making yourself healthier.', 'But movement is still all of those things. You’re still moving if you’re on a bike or if you’re running or taking a walk, or taking a walk on natural terrain or doing Zumba, or doing Nia. That’s still movement. It’s just that exercise is a category of movement because – and I use this in the book – if I climb a tree because I’m in a MovNat class, right? And the skill is to develop the muscles and the motor programming necessary to climb the tree, that’s exercise. But if I climb the tree to get apples, that’s movement, right? So it’s not to say that one is more effective over the other, just that they are different, because when it comes time to talk about this bigger topic of Nutritious Movement or movement nutrients, which I want you to write down so that you remember when we get back to it, the difference does matter, because with movement nutrients, just like with food nutrients, the outcome of your body that arises from consuming a particular diet or consuming a particular range or spectrum of vitamin and mineral or even food supplementation, right? You know, in search of the most perfect protein powder or whatever that people are on. It matters not just what is in that powder or in those pills, it also matters the context. So the context is a simple word to use in lieu of how much you take of a particular nutrient, how much you take of all of them, so like what is the amount of all of them relative to each other, how much you take in nutrients throughout the day. So like, there’s this idea of frequency, and also, like of a period – over how long of a time are you taking them at this particular frequency? All of that matters.', 'And we get this with food, right? We get this with I can – so again, from  Move Your DNA , or actually I was just seeing this kind of weird Twitter – I gotta get off social media; it doesn’t do my health any good. Like, about someone – you know, broccoli is a health food! Like, broccoli is good for you, however if you were to only eat broccoli, you would be very, very ill.', 'Well, you know what –', 'Well, I think – I think that most people get that if your diet consists solely of broccoli, you would have a disease. You would be disease-ridden if you only ate broccoli. I have enough faith in my fellow humans – at least those who have – who are on the same sort of social media, you know, if you’re listening to a podcast on health and you’re already kind of interested in natural or, you know, nutritious movement and that’s why you’re listening to this, then you already have a basic understanding of nutritional science to know that you can’t solely exist on a single food. Like I hope that you know that you would be very sick if you only ate broccoli. Right? Did you know that?', 'Do you think your kids know that? Do you think your kids know, basically, that they cannot exist on broccoli alone?', 'Okay. So we have this idea; it’s just that for some reason, when it comes time to apply critical thinking skills to this kind of stuff, we kind of lose our minds, it’s like, but broccoli is good for you! It’s like, yes! Yes. Broccoli is good for you, but it is not – it requires a particular context that makes it good for you. And only broccoli is not the right context for health. So – so keep that all in your mind. And I’ve said this before but maybe – maybe broccoli will resonate with people instead of using kale or oranges or whatever. So, um, so that’s – that’s one aspect. So let me talk about – let me talk about movement nutrition and let me get back to junk food movement and then we might be at time already. Who knows?', 'Baah-ram-ewe!', 'Right. So this next part is what I mean when I say nutritious movement, what I mean: how I mean it literally.', 'You – what we call nutrients, right? Are the chemical compounds found in food that when you put them into your mouth, they get into your body, and they create particular cellular – I’ll just call them cellular experiences, meaning that in order for your cells to go about their job, there are inputs – chemical compound inputs – that drive processes. And without them, those particular chemical processes related to whatever compound you’re talking about don’t happen, right?', 'So you end up with a compromised function, and it was through hundreds of years of seeing different compromised functions in populations that even led people to understand that there were essential nutrients that they had to take in, right?', 'Like, you didn’t come with a manual. There’s no tattoo on your body that has the requirements of your particular machine. That list was reverse-engineered by these little disease pockets that would arise and then trying to figure out to treat them, and you would be able to treat them with food, but then trying to reduce that food into different – different – a food is made of multiple compounds, so it’s like, okay, we can take an orange, and the orange will heal the scurvy. But then, you know, they would take out, you know, a certain compound of the orange and try to isolate that and then, all of a sudden that compound didn’t work. And it was through, again, like I said, hundreds of years of trial and error before they were able to identify the particular acid that kept the side effects of scurvy --', '-- or whatever. You know, it’s a connective tissue. Lack of vitamin C leads to connective tissue disorder, and eventually your connective tissue gets so weak your teeth are falling out or whatever. But a lot of people have a Vitamin C deficiency and it’s just a more subtle because it’s maybe – they’re not completely void of it – but it’s not as much as they need, relative to their particular body mass. So – so that’s that. So what I’m saying – wait, hold on, I don’t know if I want to say what I’m saying yet. Okay, so. The nutrient itself is – excuse me, I just whacked my microphone in my gesturing with my hands. The – we call the nutrient by its chemical compound name, right? The nutrient is this thing that we’ve isolated, but really what makes it nutritious is how it interacts in the body.', 'And so it is the nutrient itself is the reaction to it. The chemistry that arises when you put this chemical compound into your body. But then we also have something like vitamin D from food, but also from sunlight. So we’ve already kind of said, okay, well, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a chemical compound you put into your body, because you can get vitamin D from the sun because vitamin D is really the result – like, what we call the vitamin D is the result of what happens when you put it into the body.', 'Okay, so we got that? So I have to – I really hang my hat on vitamin D because vitamin D, you know, they’ll say, well, vitamin D is a hormone, and it’s really just vitamin D, vitamin C, all these things that we’ve named after or that we think about as the compound that you put into the machine – the input, if you will – it’s really the effect of the input that is the nutrient, all right?', 'So. In  Move Your DNA , I explain a process called mechanotransduction. Mechanotransduction is the conversion of a mechanical stimulant – a mechanical input – into a chemi – a particular series of chemical processes that are – I always get this word wrong. They’re catalysts – the catalyst is the deformation of the cell, the movement. The physical deformation of the cell brings about a result – a resulting chemical activity in the same way that putting vitamin C or exposing yourself to the sunlight results in a particular chemical activity. That resulting chemical activity is the nutrient. And so because it doesn’t matter if you put a compound into your mouth or jump up and down 10 times, those are both affecting the cells via the same – the outcome is the same, the behavior of the cells. So what I’m likening to a chemical compound are movements. So then there are nutritious movements, just as there is nutritious food, and there are less nutritious movements, in the same way that there are less nutritious foods. So also in  Move Your DNA , I’ve written this for chapters and chapters –', '- what makes a – calling something a junk food is fairly objective. You know, we can – when you say something is junk food, it’s your –', '-- your value system, but it basically means that packaged with this burst of energy, right? If there’s calories in it, there’s going to be some sort of benefit to it, right? Like, if you’re starving, would you tell someone that, like – what’s – I always use Snickers as my junk food icon. What’s your junk food icon?', 'What’s – I don’t want to use Snickers. Give me a different one. If you think junk food, what is junk food for you?', 'Quick, quick. Word association.', 'Cheetos are junk food.', 'So if someone was starving on the street, would you not give them Cheetos if it was all you had?', 'Right. Or, if it was all that was available, of course you would give someone a bag of Cheetos rather than starve because there is a benefit, really, to anything that you can eat. It might not be – it’s not fully beneficial, though, right? Because with some benefit, there’s also what I call again the biological tax. That food is taxing your system in some way. There is a benefit, but there is also a tax. And movement is the same way. Everything you can do with your body is going to have a benefit, but there are ways of moving that also come with a tax. And when I say, ‘ways of moving’ I don’t always mean ‘mode.’ You know, it’s not always –', '-- the bicycle, or the ice skate, or the pogo stick, or the rowing machine or whatever. I’m not always talking about the mode. I’m talking about the repetitive-ness of a particular way of moving. A lack of variability, you know, over the lack of frequency. Too much frequency, you know, like, it’s very nuanced. It’s just as nuanced as food, so again, we can talk about vitamin D, you know, and we can’t say good or bad, right? Because I can give someone a whole bottle of vitamin D supplements and they can take that vitamin D supplement bottle by itself without any other food or any other nutrients, all in one day, and they will be extremely sick.', 'Or they can take triple the dose on the bottle. They could take triple the dose for 30 days, and eventually their body will begin to fail, because nutrients are – they require a particular context. There’s a right amount, and there’s a right amount relative to all other nutrients.', 'So when I say junk food movement, you know, or exercise is junk food – let’s save exercise is junk food for a second. When I call junk food movement, I’m just talking about something that also comes with a biological tax. Keeping in mind, that could be any kind of movement. We won’t say, oh, natural movements like running or jumping are good. Well, I could put you in place and have you jump, you know, and say, you’re going to jump 10,000 times on this concrete and the jump – although that movement could be natural in a particular context – will hurt you. You know, so, like, you gotta start thinking. I just invite people to think with me about their use of the word, “natural.” And just the fact that – natural means in nature, you know, so, if you’re using a particular piece of equipment, or doing it on something that doesn’t look like it came from nature, then that’s not natural, you know, which is fine –', 'The – sure, sure.', 'Sure.', 'No, no, no. Not if you’re walking incorrectly. You can walk too much, period. Even if you’re walking correctly. There is not walking correctly, you know what I mean? Like, if I told you, Dani, your walk is perfect. Now I want you to go walk 100 miles without stopping – that’s too much.', 'What about Cheetos?', 'So was that helpful? Was that helpful?', 'No, I meant my bigger – my larger explanation.', 'Really?', 'Thanks.', 'Well, I think that – I think that that’s – I think that that’s – I covered everything. I covered everything there that hopefully sets the stage for whatever your next set of questions would be. Um, so, I guess just to wind up – or wind up the first 15 minutes – would be anyone listening to this, most people listening to this, I shouldn’t say anyone, but most people listening to this no longer have to move. Like, that’s the problem is with the environment. The environment no longer prompts us for moving. So everything that we’re doing is exercise. Going for a walk is exercise. Going for a walk in nature is exercise, because you don’t have any other reason to do it besides because you’re working towards your health, right? So the motivation is really what is making something exercise or not.', 'Well, it’s become –', 'Right. Well, I think that culturally we don’t have an understanding of movement because it’s not required. We use the terms interchangeably, which is a cultural issue, all right? It’s a cultural blind spot.', 'That all being said, they’re becoming muddled scientifically. Like, I don’t have a problem with the person who doesn’t understand – the general person who’s like, well, I don’t get it, should I be moving or exercising? It’s like, I’m just teasing out the scientific definition between the two so they do not get muddled in research.', 'Yeah. It’s not required – like, um, okay, so let’s use the food analogy again. Normally, my vitamin C would come in the form of, well, really, an abundance of, you know, greens and grasses, eaten along the way, and, you know, fruit. Fruit that was eaten along the way, and any other natural food that contained either trace or, you know, larger amounts of vitamin C. But it’s no longer required that I eat those foods, because why?', 'Why am I getting enough of it?', 'Well, I meant – no, I’m saying, like, originally my – my – my nutrient input would have been met by the foods that I was eating. But it’s no longer required that you eat those foods because we have supplements. Like, I can just take a vitamin C pill every day. It’s no longer required that I eat --', '-- a diet rich in vitamin C. But initially, a diet in vitamin C was not available. It had become not available to people who lived in a particular way, whether they were sailors, whether they were in jail, whether they were, um, on different, like, arctic expeditions, right? So I’m just using examples of where this research came from. So first off, there was a physical deficit in the diet. There were no supplements yet. So people had just moved away from living in a way where their nutritional need for vitamin C was met naturally, meaning, or was met environmentally, just because of the environment that they lived in. Those were the foods that they were eating. So they changed their environment, and all of a sudden, they had problems, and then it was through those problems that we recognized vitamin C. So then the solution was, oh! Eventually, let’s just get everyone – because everyone’s diet has kind of moved away from foods rich in vitamin C, whether they don’t choose to eat those foods any longer or they live in a place where no foods are available, you know? So then we have supplementation. So when I say vitamin C, most people are going to think of the supplement, where the compound occurring in food would be the more natural equivalent. And so that’s kind of the way that we’ve gone with exercise – like, our difference in nutrition is much less, you know, along the human timeline now compared to then, then our difference in movement were hyper fixated on the difference in food because that’s popular, right? So you’ve got things like the Paleo diet or ancestral eating, and going hey, there’s this discrepancy, and then there’s a lot of controversy over the exact discrepancy and the exact timeline and the continuum of the entire thing. But again, most people are pretty comfortable to go, eh, I know I need these foods, these amounts of nutrients, they don’t occur in any of the foods because I don’t eat all the parts of the meat anymore – like, before you would eat all of it, right? You know, you would have liver. But no one wants to eat liver anymore, and that’s just generational. That’s like, my parents and my grandparents ate a ton of liver, but somehow liver has become the most disgusting thing on earth. And it’s making a comeback, but in general, you know, they don’t serve liver in schools any longer. And there’s a lot of political –', 'Well, I mean, there you go. Right, right? But it’s not – it’s not, right? So we go – we went from this full, natural diet to um, low-variability in foods because we were limited to the foods that we could mass produce, and then when we started mass producing everything, we wanted stuff that mass produced even better, so we started taking smaller – we would take species, whether it was plants of animals with a better grow-in-captivity spectrum of qualities, right, you know? So then you start to select to grow what grows best, what you can produce, and then you’re slowly going from super wide nutrients to less nutrients or less foods representing the nutrients, and then you get smaller and smaller to less variance of those foods to represent, and then you get to things that are just kind of pseudo-foods. So we went from wild crab apples, right, to mass produced apples. I grew up on an apple farm, heirloom varieties, then you go to like, I mean, we had 12 different varieties that don’t even exist anymore of apples.', 'And they were all very different. And then you get to, you know, the same 5 apples that everyone recognizes the names of and they’re in every single grocery store, year-round. And then eventually you go to applesauce, you know, but then applesauce has less percentage of even apple in it, but we all call it apple, right? It still has the same name as when it represented a very large breadth –', '-- of nutrition. So that’s what we have with movement right now. What you are looking at right now with what we do for movement is the equivalent of what most kids eat in the cafeterias in most schools. It’s just junk.', 'Well, that’s – I mean, that’s a great question and I don’t know if I have a great answer.', 'Well, what I think – what I think is – I think that – it’s like, this idea of a meme, right? Your culture begins to influence the way that you think, and then how you think then influences the physical things that you produce, and then it’s just the way that it happens. Why don’t we think about movement larger than exercise? It’s because you don’t have any experience for it. You have no experience for sustaining yourself on wild food. Like, as much as we talk about it, and see it in, you know, um, and we can talk about it on podcasts, and everyone’s like, oh I went out hiking and here’s my foods that I foraged for my salad – and I do think all the time, it’s like, here’s my dandelions in my taco. It’s like, that’s amazing. But the fact of the matter is, I would be dead in like 17 days because I don’t have any real skills to survive in the wild. The difference between my physical being had I always needed a certain amount of movement and a certain amount of awareness – it’s so far away. It’s like a dot from where we are. It’s so far away. So, like, this is – it’s almost, you know, I’ve seen it written it’s like this whole, this whole way of thinking about, you know, nutrition – like, what’s the best nutritious diet and the, you know, the best nutritious movement, you know. And I took a workshop in nutritious movement and I drank cans of coconut milk, you know, because I’m healthy. It’s like, it’s like – it becomes fodder. It almost feels like fodder for a group of people that have no real worries about anything, which is ironic, meaning the whole reason you and I are having a podcast about how we need to move and eat differently is because we come from a time where no movement or ability to understand food is even required, right?', 'Like, so, I think it’s that. I think it’s just – it’s our culture. It’s just this is how we’ve been shaped. And also, scientific, like rigorous investigation requires reduction. It requires it.', 'There’s just not – if you’re going to isolate a variable to measure it, that’s what isolating a variable means, I mean it’s reduction. But the thing is you’ve got to integrate it back into a broader picture. But we’re not as good at doing that as we are at reduction. And then, you know, everything is about consumerism, right? So then it’s just about driving people to certain products and the best protein powder and the best minimal shoes and the best, and the best! You know, when you – I did a great podcast with the Rewild Yourself with Daniel V, you know?', 'But it was at the end, it was like, this is crazy – like, the irony of spending so much of my time writing and talking about natural movement on the computer, you know, it’s just – I just need to shut everything down and throw everything away and then just move off the grid. Like, that’s the step that in my gut I’m really trying to get to – but – I am just as much a part of my culture and society as everyone else listening, so. I mean, I am taking baby steps, and I don’t mean that everyone should feel good about whatever steps that we can take, but the irony isn’t lost on me. Like, it’s – you said, paradigms are huge cultural shifts are huge, and at a certain point we will or we will not, you know, realize that an understanding of these things is necessary. And so people will say, well, we’ve adapted as far as movement goes – everyone will be like, we’ve adapted, you know? You’ve physically adapted. I can ride my bike 100 miles 7 times a week, which would be every day, it would probably have been better to say every day instead of 7 times a week, but I was going for effect. You know, and I can run this much – it’s like, we’ve adapted to doing it, and I think that comes from a poor understanding of movement in that, like, you didn’t adapt. Just because there’s no oranges around you or plants or foods with vitamin C anymore, you never lost your requirement for a particular nutrient. You’re just so easy at supplementing it that you no longer recognize the essential-ness of it. And so with movement, um, all we’re trying to do is like, keep down the symptoms. You know, when you pick a mode of exercise that works for you, keep in mind that ‘works for you’ can be kind of subjective if you’re not able to associate the injuries or diseases you have with a lack of mechanical nutrients, because no one knows what the mechanical nutrients are.', 'That – can I just end this section now? Because I think I could just keep talking. With just this idea that the next step will be to understand what are the spectrum of nutrients that are required. What is your current exercise program supplementing? Because it’s a supplement, and what isn’t your current exercise program supplementing in that that’s what you’re trying to get. So with Restorative Exercise™, it is exercise supplements. The pelvic list, the monster walk, the calf stretch – these are supplements. These are exercises. These are me trying to go, okay, anatomically speaking, biomechanically speaking, what are the loads – because the loads would be the input – missing from your movement diet in trying to help people see, like, this is a part of you that needs – that should move and needs to be loaded, because this part of you is getting no nutrition. Your modes of exercise, or the way that you have moved – say, like, I don’t exercise – it’s like, well you still move – it’s the way that you’ve moved. Throw exercise out. The way that you’ve moved – whatever that movement profile is – has a certain amount of nutrients and is missing a certain amount of nutrients. And collectively speaking, there are nutrients that most of us are missing on a regular basis, and that’s what we’re supplementing with are these little corrective exercise vitamins. Or minerals.', 'Right. But just to clarify, since this is a clarifying show, you’re using corrective exercises so then you can go out and do more exercise.', 'Yes, but – but – why are you playing? Like, it’s not essential. Play is not essential. And I – and I want to differentiate now between play meaning if you lived in the wild, you would not be playing, because you would not have the time and the luxury to play. Children play, I mean, even current hunter gatherer children play, but they play mimicking skill sets that they will require as an adult. Meaning that their play is a precursor to good movement skills that survival depends on. So what – I just want to say this again, for you, just as much as for anyone else out there, the reason you’re doing corrective exercises is so that you can then go out and exercise.', 'Yes, but you don’t really think that’s going to happen, do you? I mean, I’m saying like –', 'No. Well, yeah. Right. But I mean – just for clarity, to clarify, I want you to –', 'Like, now you’re the mission. You’re doing corrective exercises so you can exercise. It’s just that your mode of preferred exercise – and mine – is lowercase natural movement. Meaning that you’re choosing – in the same way that you have a whole foods diet, right? You’ve made the conscious decision to eat a whole foods diet. But whole foods diet in most cases does not mean natural diet, meaning diet as found in nature. Like, if you have cans of coconut milk – if you have foods that are not in season from places, like, people are like, this is my whole foods diet, and it’s like, yeah – that’s fine. But it’s like, whole – Capital W, Capital F, Capital D. It’s not a diet as in found in nature, right? That would be wild food. Period. Wild food that was seasonal, punctuated by hunks of time where no food was available, right? It would be stuff that you would never even consider eating right now that you couldn’t even bring yourself to eat now. So that’s the same thing with movement. You’re exercising – and I – the corrective exercises so we can exercise. It’s just that our mode of preferred exercise is natural movement, which looks almost nothing at all like actual movements found in nature were nature our only option. Got it?', 'You sure?', 'Because if you have holes in your thinking, that’s a good thing to flesh out now, because chances are someone else has that same hole, you know.', 'That’s not your reality.', 'But then – but then here’s the other half. Vitamin C is essential. You actually do have to worry about it, you know? You do have to worry about your survival. One of the reasons you’re going up in the tree is because you’re trying to survive at the cellular level, and that’s why you’re partaking natural movement. In the same way that you would partake a whole foods diet is because you actually are trying to survive. So that’s like a weird – we get into a philosophical discussion about what actually survival means, and we’re talking short term survival vs. long term survival.', 'And we can discuss it more, but just to clarify, the exercise and movement, you are always going to be exercising when you’re going to go out to do something. But let me say this: if you just start sitting on the floor, then in that case, you getting down to the floor and back up again wouldn’t necessarily be put into the exercise category unless you were doing it purely motivated out of, like, I want looser hips, I want stronger muscles, I want better health outcome. So that’s one reason why I got rid of my furniture. Because when it was my way of life, I was less in the space of doing it for a particular health outcome, and it was just more – like, that was just how I sit now. It’s just how I use my body now to live within my particular environment. So it was more of an environmental adjustment rather than having to constantly be a choice. And again, that distinction – it’s a little bit more heady and philosophical, meaning how is our makeup altered by choice? You know, so I don’t have any skill set in that, other than to say that I think, you know, if you’re talking about ego or whatever, you know there might be a difference between when you’re choosing to exercise to have a particular shape for a particular reason, or just when you unconsciously do it because because that’s the way it is. Because part of natural movement, you know, as found in nature, is like, that wasn’t done for any other reason but short-term survival. So, anyway. We might have gone off the rails, I don’t know. \\xa0 D; That’s okay. I’ll bring us back. Just – um, and we are almost out of time – but also I just was thinking about this, because I was like, yeah, she’s got a point. But I do Restorative Exercise™ so that I can lift my arm without my shoulder or back hurting, not even just so I can pull myself up in a tree, but just so I can go about my day to day life with more mobility, I mean, that’s – that’s an essential part of it for me. I don’t know. I mean, I think even though it’s not required for us to be able to do those things in our culture, I think our body definitely needs those – those movement nutrients just to keep from moving into a decrepit pile of dust that can’t move. \\xa0 KATY: Well, again, that’s my clarification between short term and long term survival. You know, it’s a much broader, I think, it’s a much broader evolutionary argument, like, you are not necessarily structured for long term survival, meaning there’s always going to be some sort of trade-off, and I write about a couple of those trade-offs in  Move Your DNA , you know, like doing something for better shoulder mobility is still – it’s still an exercise. You’re trying to restore a baseline mobility that would have been there had you moved your whole entire life in a particular way. So.', 'We could probably do – we could probably do a second show on questions that arised from just doing this show. But it will help everyone if they can keep in their mind that exercise and movement are not the same thing, but almost all of what you do is going to be exercise because of your culture.', 'But they are not the same thing, and then there’s smaller things, like breastfeeding. Or, you know, your arm moving when you go to take a walk there’s going to be – I don’t mean to downplay any of these things – it’s just that to answer that initial question of what is the difference between them, exercise and movement, and also movement – exercise is not bad. It’s just what we have left. And I think that that tagline, exercise less, move more is trying to delineate between people who feel like they’ve met their daily movement requirement by doing a single bout of exercise, rather than looking at their sum total of movement head to toe throughout their body over the course of a day.', 'So it’s just a lot of confusing ways of using all these terms, but hopefully we’ve clarified. Hopefully. A bit.']}\n",

I don’t have a dog, though. I know I’ve heard people say that I could never – could never transition to doing something on the ground because I have dogs.

Where do you get those? Where do those – what happens there? So yeah, that kind of stuff. Um…what else? You know, mortar and pestle. You know, like, making things even from more whole if you can – where there’s more movement. You know, movement traditionally has been involved in preparing food forever, and I don’t mean, like, walking to the store and walking back home again. I’m talking about actually, physically processing, mashing, ripping, tearing off. So finding foods – even if it’s spices that you have to mash, or you know, don’t buy juice. If you’re going to have juice, just get fruit and let your kids juice it, or juice it yourself. Try to figure out if there’s a 1-step less processed food that you can get that you have to do some sort of physical labor yourself. Like we had the Hawaii retreat for our instructors a couple years ago, and one of the things I had them do was just, like, here’s a coconut! There’s no tools in sight. If you want your coconut snack – a green coconut – you’re going to have to open it yourself, you know? And it was like,', 'No! Yeah, just fresh. No machetes. You’re like going back even before a tool, you take your rock, and it was an amazing, amazing experience.', 'Well, the person who opened it the fastest just grabbed it overhead and bashed it as hard as they could on the rock and cracked it open. However, they lost the bulk of the juice that way, right? So there’s this brute force, but then there’s also this refinement. And then we also had people – I mean, we had men, we had women, we had people from – I think my daughter was the youngest at 1 to the oldest person who was in their 70s – and it was, for many people, the first time physical work had ever been done to get a calorie.', 'Oh, my gosh. Isn’t that crazy? DANI: That is awesome. That must have been so fun to watch. \\xa0 KATY: Well, and –', 'It was awesome, and it was like – oh my gosh, I – like, it was a triumph. And that – I’m getting emotional about it right now, because it was like this moment –', 'It was this moment where there was this balance in nature, where we’re going, your whole life! Your whole life used to be – or might have been – a direct exchange of physical nourishment for physical labor. That’s the discrepancy that this person had been at for 70+ years. And that’s phenomenal. Like, this accomplishment –', '-- of like, I didn’t even think I had the strength, but – and it took like 30 minutes of chipping away, and then to drink that – that liquid down. I’ve got a great picture of it, too. It was – it was really fun. And then, you know, things like foraging macadamia nuts. But they’re in their shells, you know? So you’ve got to take little rocks and crack them open. Not huge – go get some walnuts in the shell. Go to your farmer’s markets and get walnuts in the shell, and make that what you do with your kids, or do it with your friends.', 'Right? And then – but don’t use a walnut cracker. Use a heavy rock, right? There you go. There’s physical labor. That’s a fun activity, right? All day long, all life long.', 'Oh, my gosh! Yeah, and that’s a – that’s an old school thing. I grew up, I always talk about, like, I grew up in a kind of rural environment and all the old folks would sit around. We had a huge walnut tree, all the kids would gather walnuts during the season – oh, my god – huge – I mean, I remember, it was like: here’s your bag! And we got paid.', 'We got paid like a dollar. A dollar for 10,000 walnuts or whatever child labor violation was at that time. But you would go gather, and they would have the skins on. And you would dry them, because the skins are toxic. And you’d peel the skins off and then they’d dry in the sun, and then all the old folks would sit around with walnut crackers and chat for hours, you know, at a family barbecue, cracking them open and putting them in a bowl, and then everyone would take some bags home. And that was – I did that every year of my childhood is that black walnut tree. Stuff like that, you know. There’s so many things to hack. Man, hacking is getting more and more literal. Just hack your walnuts open. So that’s the kind of stuff that I do in the kitchen.', 'And also, less food – I only buy food for a meal.', 'Yep. Yep. I have this relationship with getting food every day. Yes, it’s from the store, you know, or light foraging. But for the most part, it’s just so that I have – the kids have this idea that when we want food, it’s not readily available in our house. It’s just – it’s a hack. It’s a total hack –', 'But whatever – like, I spend – everyone’s trying to fill their whole entire days with activities, it’s like, our activities are just eating. We spend so much energy on getting food, you know? It could be way easier. I could go to Costco and stock my whole house, but then I would – then I would have even less – I would have even more time to fill every day.', 'I’d like to say yes, but –', 'Yeah – we’re just regular, like, we’re regular people who have all the same – like, these are just tiny, little hacks. They’re still all the same – like, my life is not utopia by any means. I don’t want to – I don’t want to portray that this is amazing and it’s just so great. It’s just the activities that we choose to do. I choose to go, like, all right, for the next 90 minutes the activity that I have planned today is go here! Walk here and get this, or berry picking – you know, whatever I try to do. I try to do food related stuff, because food and movement, to me, are baseline requirements. Baseline. So I try to build my homeschool/unschool activities around that.', 'Okay.', 'You could get to the bathroom quickly.', 'Uh..', 'Yeah, you know one. What’s my favorite bathroom hack?', 'Yeah, Squatty Potty or a squat platform, right?', 'I’ve got one of each, even though I only have one toilet now, which is a problem in a house of four people who eat a lot of whole foods, and who are all on a super regular schedule, like we all poop within 30 minutes of each other. So, yeah. It’s tough. So Squatty Potty is one, and I don’t think I have any other bathroom hacks, right? I’ve got toilet paper. I know people would love to say something like, I don’t have any of that kind of stuff, but um…nope, I think that’s my only one.', 'Living room.', 'No couch.', 'No TV.', 'Not really, it’s totally boring. I keep all my exercise stuff in my room, my living room.', 'Right? Because if you’re already sitting on the floor, you might as well just grab that dome or strap or Yoga Tune Up® ball or whatever and do a few things while you’re there.', 'The hard part was getting down to the floor.', 'Yeah!', 'Yeah, it’s actually a wool rug in the living room. What else do we have? You know, in our new house we – it was already there, like a window box of seats. Like it was just a little, small –', 'Bench. A built-in bench, so we just got cushions to put on top of that, so now it solved when other people come over who are unable to sit on the floor who just can’t even fathom doing it, that’s where they all sit. But it also gives us two levels to play with, like we’ll sit on the floor, but we’ll also sit – it’s not very comfortable, like, so you’re still squatting or sitting on folded knees with your legs tucked underneath you, or lying down. So it’s still a flat surface, but raised. So it just – it gives a little more depth to the living room.', 'Yeah, nothing else in there that I can think of.', 'My office.', 'My office – the family office, right? So I’ve got my low desk, that dynamic workstation. We have a piece of equipment that my husband found in a thrift store, that I don’t even know what it was, but it’s a standing, rolling rack. It might have been something for the kitchen, like an old – you know what it probably was was an old, um, rolling baker’s rack for a microwave, you know, that came out in the ‘80s. And so it has that and it has the computer on it, and so he can move that around, you know, as necessary and if he wants to look out a certain window or he wants to be working but looking in to the living room, and I think that’s about it, and there’s more exercise equipment in here, you know, like foam rollers and balls. I’m kind of looking around.', 'Yeah, yeah. Um, and that’s about it. And then walk into the – we have a kids’ – what we call the kids’ kind of playroom, and that’s got the monkey bar hack.', 'And that would probably be that indoor monkey bar set we’re known for. And then in our bedroom is the sleeping hacks, right? The – we used to sleep directly on the floor, so that’s probably changed from before. We used to have our mats, like a foam mat, directly on the floor.', 'Yeah, it was a Costco foam topper, no pillow, right? So that’s kind of known about us is we don’t have that – that level of padding, we try to get more movement meaning we don’t assume the same structural position all day that we also assume through the night, that way we have an environment that allows for different loading during that sleeping phase.', 'But we got – so two things happened, and I’m working on a blog post about it. The first was we got mold under the mats –', '-- Because we have just pine – straight pine boards, and then we had the foam, it was so thin it would conduct our heat right down and we’re in the Pacific Northwest so it got a little moist, and then we got mold. So we weren’t – I was like, ok, we could roll up our beds, two of them – so all of our family bedding is in the same room – we could roll them up every night or we could make a platform to lift them off the ground. So that’s the first thing we started to do was to make these wood platforms so it was still hard, the same level of hardness, but raised them a little bit, um, so that there could be airflow –', '-- underneath, and it’s like a slatted wood, so that there’s airflow to the mattress. But then I started tuning into all of the, um, anti-inflammatory – not anti-inflammatory.', 'What’s – what is it?', 'Flame retardants.', 'Well, I guess that’s anti-inflammatory, right? But no. I started tuning into the flame retardant stuff. I had never – it just wasn’t on my radar, like, chemistry, I’m so biomechanics, biomechanics, movement. And I don’t read hardly anything on the Internet, like, I’m just not – I go on the Internet for work and then right back off again. I don’t really spend any time on there. And I was blown away at the amount of research and awareness of the toxicity of flame-retardants, and it’s in everything. And so one hack that we have done is to get rid of things that are affecting our physical health that are non-visible. Like, it’s clear to see we don’t have a couch, it’s clear to see the angles of my knees and hips. Not so clear to see what I’m breathing in, and as it turns out, like what’s in breast milk. So I’m still nursing and they’re finding flame-retardants in breast milk and that children are having much higher quantity of flame retardant in their bodies, like, it’s hugely toxic. So then I started researching other mattresses, but – by law it’s sprayed on every single mattress, so long story short, we found cotton and wool because it’s not as flammable. Untreated pads that we put on our slats. So we still have the hardness of the floor, but now we don’t have any of that.', 'About 4” was as –', 'And firm. So what I do is I walk on the surface, so you know, so I got a tweet from some guy, he’s like, are we after as hard as possible? I’m like, no, you’re not after as hard as possible. What you’re after is natural amount of hardness. So if I go out in the forest and I hike without any shoes on, I can feel the give of the ground. There’s give to natural ground. There is no give to my hard wood floors. There’s no give to the wood that is underneath the mattress. So when I walk on it – there’s a firm – its very firm. It’s much firmer than a traditional mattress. So it works for us. Truth be told, I actually preferred to sleep on the ground, straight on the ground, with even less support, but I really wanted to get rid of that gas first and all this – I’ll wait and see what else comes around for mattresses. Like, I was fine with the negotiation of an extra inch. So we did that.', 'Yeah.', 'You know, and I – if it was just adults sleeping in the bed, I think it’d be easier. But I’ve got kids and what I’ve found is they’re such eggbeater sleepers. They spin. They were just destroying the set of blankets and every night I was uncomfortable because they were pulling everything off because it wasn’t really attached in this kind of traditional bedding, tucking in. So that’s why – we made that transition for right now, and I mean – I – we try different stuff all the time. So we’ll be doing this for a while and then we’ll do another podcast on what else. But I just thought of another hack. I thought of an office/bedroom hack.', 'We put a timer on our wireless Wi-Fi, on the router so that it shuts it off – I think it’s at 11 – and it keeps it off and it puts it back on at 5.', 'To turn off whatever is emitting from that every single night. Also to get whoever is on the Internet late off of the Internet and get them to go to bed. I won’t say who that is, but you know, it’s just one of those hacks, it’s like, if it shuts off, most of us are like, not going to go and reprogram the $10 timer from Radio Shack. But that’s been huge, and our sleep quality – huge, hugely different if that makes sense.', 'Yeah.', 'And depth. Depth of sleep. You know, I had a big, weird dream shift right at the beginning, but what I’ve noticed that’s really persisted is that I’m still sleeping deeply in the morning where normally I would wake up around 4:30 or 5:00 just kind of like, I’m awake, how strange. There’s a certain depth there, so everyone can do their own experimentation, but yeah – that was crazy. I think what makes it a hack is that we put a timer on it, right?', 'So it’s – I don’t have to think about it, I don’t have to walk over and turn it on or turn it off, but um.', 'Weird!', 'Yeah. Yeah. I think that’s all my hacks. That’s my list of hacks.', 'Gosh, that’s a good question. I don’t know. You know, for me – the challenge is in the decision. It’s in executing it, not doing whatever it is. So I would say probably the one that require – I don’t know. Sitting on the floor was big. So sitting on the floor required quite a bit of physical, like I didn’t have the shape of my body to sit on the floor comfortably. I’ve always had very tight hips when my knees are out to the side. My rotators in my hips have always been tight. Hamstrings not so much, but rotators, yes. So when I first started sitting on the floor, it was really uncomfortable so I had to bolster myself up, you know, with pillows and eventually, because I assumed that position so much my body just became reshaped by it and is now in the shape that is – I’m a floor sitter now. Same thing, though, for sleeping. Not so much the mattress, but getting rid of my pillow. Like that – that required quite a bit of transition time. So that would be a toss-up between slowly getting rid of the pillow, right? Going from a larger pillow to something smaller and smaller and smaller. I probably made 5 steps, 5 different shapes.', 'Gosh, I would say – like 18 months, maybe?', 'Yeah, and I’ve had headaches – like, headaches have always been my thing. And so when I start playing with my head and neck position, I’ve never had migraine headaches but just tension headaches because of tension in my neck and head. So the pillow was – the pillow was big, but I don’t know if that was that much longer than floor sitting. So around that time. It took 18 months, but it certainly is – floor sleeping is way less strange for other people coming into your house and not having a couch. There’s the whole having – fitting into a community of people, too, that’s a different one, so. What was yours? What was your biggest hack?', 'Yeah.', 'I didn’t have to convince anybody.', 'Yeah, I mean, I don’t –', 'Well, there’s – I mean, healthy is an interesting choice of words to describe that scenario. I think it is – I think I would probably pick a different word than healthy, but, um, I don’t know.', 'Right.', 'No, I get that, but I was just trying to say, like, it goes right up there, like what do you do if you have a partner who smokes? Or if you are the one who smokes? Like, or, food-wise, what do you do – what do you do in your family, like are you guys pretty healthy eaters, would you say?', 'Now, see, that’s interesting, because I don’t have teenagers. I don’t have older children. I have little kids, they’ve only known a particular way of life. I don’t know what it’s going to be like when they’re older and are exposed to more things and want to do things differently, so I don’t really have any experience outside of, this is just what our family does. My husband’s just as into health as I am, so – I’ve never really broached this kind of subject. I’m certainly not a marriage – I mean, it seems like it’s more like a marriage counselor –', '-- or a partner coun – like someone who counsels someone in relationships, because –', 'Well –', 'Do you make – like if you’re making a meal, a healthy meal, would you make junk food for the ones who don’t want to eat healthy?', 'Yeah, like, it’s – I would say – I mean, my advice would be: if someone else’s behavior is causing you stress, that is a personal problem to be solved.', 'Meaning if your family – and like, I have people like, I’m so stressed, like, I want to be healthy and my partner won’t let me be – well, the only person making you stressed about someone else’s decision to not follow your particular way of life, like, that’s just your –', '--personal amount of stress. You can just feel good about sitting on the floor. I – I wrote a blog post years ago about exercise adherence on the research about why someone does – would start an exercise program and stick with it versus not, but I think that that research and psychology in general is like – I had a friend who was a smoker. And he was a real kind of educated guy, and he got – he got the idea, it’s like, okay, I know smoking’s, you know, killing me. But it was such a long time away that he wasn’t truly motivated to stop more than he was interested in smoking now. Like he was – I had taught a class on what actually was happening mechanically in the moment that you were smoking. It wasn’t that this is eventually lead to demise, right? That’s how we position so much of health is, like, you’re going to die earlier. It’s like, who cares? When it comes to the enjoyment of life, who cares if you’re talking about living 2 years longer or not if it means that your whole life is unenjoyable, right? But if someone is suffering every single day because of their, let’s just say smoking – or because of their sitting on the couch, but they don’t really understand that there’s a direct, in the real-time suffering that they are seeking a solution to – that’s always seemed to be the thing for me. This guy, he came up to me and he was like, I had no idea what was actually happening to me when I smoked. It was always this nebulous, ‘this isn’t good for you, you’ll live a lot longer!’ La la la, and he was like, I didn’t really care about living a little bit longer, but I had no idea that the, you know, 7 doctor’s appointments that I had every quarter and that this particular pain and this particular issue in my body was all tied to my smoking. No one had ever explained that before, it was just always general, like, this isn’t good for you, and don’t you want to be healthy? Like, that word: don’t you want to be healthy?', 'He figured this out after that class, and he stopped smoking the next day.', 'He was like, like I said, he was a guy – he was a logical guy. It’s just – it’s very logical to also say, “who cares if I die 2 or 5 years earlier?” I mean, that whole – that whole, you know, desire for continued life is certainly – you know, it’s going to be a bigger thing at the end of your life you will be looking forward to those 2 or 5 years.', 'But if you’re 12 and your mom wants to get rid of the couch, that’s not a very good argument.', 'No, but if it’s – if, if, you know, someone is having to stay home 3 days with menstrual pains, and has to go to the doctor to take hormone pills because of really bad periods. I’m just trying to, like, come up with other things that are related to repetitive, physical position and lack of movement in general. If someone’s suffering from these all of the time, sometimes explaining it – or going, why don’t we try floor sitting for this week to see, you know, how things, how it goes for our family, right? There was screen-free week, right? That was a big, national thing and everyone was like, “screen free week, yay! We’re doing it as a family!” Doing things where there’s only part of your family involved usually doesn’t work very well for sustainability. So I don’t know. I – I don’t have any help there. I don’t have any help there. I have my particular understanding of the problem but I don’t know. Be a role model, don’t get –', 'But also, make sure you’re not enabling. Like, you know, I always use the junk food, it’s like, yeah, a lot of kids don’t like health food, either. But that doesn’t mean that you make a junk food dinner because you really – you, if you are the caretaker of your family’s well-being, you’re maybe more – you’re willing to take on the burden of people’s complaints more so. Like, what would happen if you got rid of your couch, Dani? What would happen if you said, “I’m getting rid of the couch,” and they came home to no couch, what would happen? Can you imagine?', 'Yeah, so. Like, what’s the cost?', 'It’s interesting, it’s just a – the desire to keep everyone happy all of the time is a – is a – certainly one that I’ve dealt with the bulk of my life, so I don’t know. This is a podcast on something that I don’t even know anything about.', 'No.', 'Or even, I’m nothing besides someone who’s trying to explain –', '- the mechanical consequences, like, I don’t know. There’s a lot of people who have, like, behavior – behavior’s addictive, period. We have what we call the bad behaviors, or the negative addictions, but you’re just – you just – you enjoy doing the same things you’ve always done over and over again, and when someone wants to change them, you don’t want to, whether it’s, you know, Cheetos – right, Cheetos was our junk food example? Like if you ate an all Cheetos diet or you want to get rid of the couch, you don’t want to add a quarter mile of walking because it requires change and resistance is, resistance is natural – but so are the consequences.', 'Oh, my gosh. I’m physically – yes! Yes.', 'I might be a hack, you just never know.', 'That was pretty good.', 'Have you gotten any questions yet?', 'Really?', 'That’s kind of cool.', 'Bye!']}\n",

Just a reminder for you listening: if you want to ask a question or the show, if there’s something you want us to talk about or you’re curious about something, you could go to Katy’s website, which is KatySays.com or RestorativeExercise.com, both of those, and there’s really cool ways that you can talk to us. You can actually record a question to us using a little widget off to the side of the site, or if you’re shy, you can type a question and we will get those, and possibly add them to future shows. Also, don’t forget that we love your reviews on iTunes and Stitchr because it really helps create a better show for you. It helps me do my job better, and we love feedback. Don’t forget to just take a few minutes sometime and give us a review on iTunes or Stitchr. Did you have anything?', 'Oh, that is an excellent idea – since you all forgot to get us something for our year anniversary, we will forgive you because you can just come in under the wire and give us a nice, thorough review on iTunes.', 'Thanks for – yeah, word. Well, thanks for your time, Katy, and thanks to all of you for listening.'], 'KATY': ['No, I don’t. I don’t mind at all. So, happy anniversary.', 'Yeah. We need some champagne.', 'Or, if I could just pop in, maybe if you’re like, there’s no way I’m starting a school, thanks, I already have a job – like, maybe just even taking tiny tidbits of what we talk about today and just implementing them 15 minutes a day into your life, what you do on weekends with your groups of friends. So – if – don’t turn it off just because you’re like, there’s no way I can, like, balk the traditional education system. We’re talking about, like, broader than that, I would say.', 'Okay.', 'Awesome.', 'Yeah, I’ll start one tomorrow in my free time.', 'All right, bring it.', 'Um, well, I guess it’s just it’s probably just the difference is – it has to do with time. You know, a camp is this isolated – you either go away and live there for a week or you go every day for a week and then you return to your regular life. You know, there’s – I’m just trying to – I’m trying to actually recall, I know I went to camp. But it didn’t leave that big of an impression on me. I think I went to, like, a Girl Scout camp a few times. But nature school is your schooling happening in a natural setting. And there’s a couple different types of nature school – you know, nature school is like a category. There are schools that have a much stiffer curriculum where they’re actually doing traditional curriculums just outside. And then there are schools in which the curriculum is nature, and that changes – I mean, it changes depending on the, I guess the mission of the school, but then also depending also on the year of the students. So preschools set in a natural setting would be different than 6 th  and 8 th  grades in a natural setting. And there are those types of schools, but they’re going to be different. So I would just say that what we’re talking about right now is schooling that happens in a natural setting, so everything that you are, um, not necessarily everything item to item that you’re getting out of school – but you wouldn’t be going to natural school and also to regular school, although there are survival schools, but that’s not what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about your curriculum, your preschool, your first grade, your third grade happening in nature.', 'I would say so, and probably the world.', 'Gosh, how long is this episode? I mean, I don’t know why it would matter.', 'Especially because I didn’t get you anything – feel free to talk! Um, why it matters to you would probably be different than why it matters to me. All I can speak of is why it matters to me. You know, right now we’re constantly spending billions of dollars on research, on people who are ill, on children who are struggling whether you’re talking about physically or emotionally or psychologically. Communities – there are so many problems, right? There are problems. Yet, for me, when you’re looking at trying to solve a problem you want to make sure you’re asking the right question, and I think understanding – especially, you know, after you talked about Nature Deficit Disorder at the beginning of this show, you mentioned it, and it’s the term that was coined by Richard Louv – and do you remember the title of his book?', 'Last Child in the Woods.  So that gives a good framework for – you know, there’s so many research articles on different aspects, like, we call nature an environment, but there’s all these different reductions of nature: to vitamin D, and light exposure and what’s coming off of the trees and an abundant amount of walking, and fresh air, and dirt, and microbiome, and all these fractured pieces. But when you put them all together, as you can read in Richard’s book – I talk about him like he’s my friend, my friend Richard, he wrote this book and you should get it. I just like to be familiar with people right off the bat. You realize that people have really assembled giant bodies of research for you and it’s like, okay, animals do well in a natural environment, there’s a particular habitat. So I just felt like – to continue in my own home the discussion about, like, the giant elephant in the room which is, we’re not supposed to be sitting as much, we’re supposed to be moving more, we need more outdoor time – yet the biggest road block to that is that we have this system in which you go into the school as a very young child and begin decades of sitting to prepare you for decades more of sitting. You know, it’s kind of my  Stop the Insanity!  Moment. Just be like, let’s – let’s just not – I couldn’t put my kids into a sitting school. I, personally, couldn’t. Like, I felt very out of alignment, if you will, with the decision like that, and we were very fortunate that – we did not have an existing nature school here before. It just happened to start the year that my oldest child was about to go into a preschool.', 'And so –', 'Am I not getting too much of this, or too much of that? Like, so – whatever parent is listening to this right now, it’s like, whatever you’re doing is like, there’s no judgment on whatever decision people are making. It’s just that this is what we decided was perfect and so we went into nature school. And why it’s important to me is mostly for physiological and biochemical and biomechanical reasons. I just felt that all of the things that I help people with later on in their life starts now, and so what if I didn’t – what if I learned from that experience, and had the opportunity to choose something different, and so I chose something different.', 'Yeah, I’m learning about it with you.', 'You mean what –', 'Um, well, it looks different – I mean, there’s – it’s – I’ll say that it’s constant movement, but it’s not like an exercise school. There’s lots of still inquiry, you know, lots of – you know, you’re moving through the forest in many cases, and of course, every day is different, so there is no – there’s not as strict of a routine where you’re trying to manage the space of a room. It’s like, you know, okay, this group goes over, you know, to this side of the room and you do this, now it’s time to wash your hands, now it’s time for your snack. It’s – the day has some general organization to it, but it’s really considered to be childrens’ interest-driven. You know, it’s always going to be safety – safety is the first and foremost, I would say, foundation of the school, so there’s never anything going on that’s unsafe. But essentially the kids are moving through some sort of hike loop, but of course, you can’t plan a school of 10 children on a loop because – on a real loop – because what happens if you find the salamanders that are starting to come out early?', 'And then you’ll miss that discussion if you have to keep going, you’ll miss the discussion of what salamanders coming out in February means as opposed to salamanders coming out in April means, and then that lends itself to broader discussions about weather and temperature, and things that we forget – how we learn them. If we think back to how we learn these concepts of temperature, like, a lot of times it was just, you know, in a book with a little picture of a temperature and a picture of something being frozen, as opposed to actually chipping the ice off – and, and also – anyway, we can talk more about that kind of stuff, less, like, individual things that my kids have experienced, but – you’re moving through, you’re having discussions, there’s songs. There’s sing-songy stuff that’s going on, and there are – there’s art. The art is using charcoal, finding fires that other people have left behind, and then therefore using –', 'Yeah, using rocks and charcoal and –', 'Yes – there is – so everyone’s like, okay, so – it’s like outdoors as long as it’s not bad weather. No, it’s – there’s no building. It is a 100% outside school. They don’t start in a building and then move outside. You drop your kids off outside. They stay outside the entire time, even if it’s raining, and then you pick them back up when they’re done. And then there are some though safety types of weather where they are not allowed outside. So lightning, obviously, heavy winds –', 'That’s electricity, kids! You see how your hair’s standing up on its end?', 'You could really talk about statistics. Um, outliers, when you’re looking at the layer – the one who is outlaid in front of you. Anyway.', 'Oh my gosh. What were we talking about?', 'Safety! So like, there’s some safety parameters that outdoor schools that will have depending on the area. For us, high winds is one because they’re in a forest, and trees blow down all the time, so that’s not – or they’ll change their location to a field, you know, so it’s kind of cool because there’s this dynamic ability of the school when it doesn’t have a structure. Um – and I’m trying to think what else. Yeah. 100% outside, baby.', 'Just like humans have been, like, you’re not made of brown sugar, people. The rain is fine.', 'Say it again?', 'Aah, that’s great. Did you get your money’s worth right there? Your degree’s money’s worth right there.', 'What does  wald  mean?', 'Oh, okay.', 'Well, I think that’s a cultural thing. Like, even if we kept the curriculum identical, like spelling or whatever. The idea that that has to happen indoors is probably the first assumption that you would want to let go. There’s nothing that says you couldn’t do all of the curriculum that you do in your school on a park bench, right?', 'So it would be more like, where does the paper? Who has the paper? It’s like, where do you keep the  stuff  is really more the question, you know? And it’s like, well, every child has their own backpack.', 'So every child is responsible for – which I love – the relationship to their stuff – as opposed to going into a room where –', '-- an overabundance of stuff is made convenient by the structure that houses it for them. But if a child has to carry their stuff – and the teacher, too – the teacher carrying, carrying their stuff for the day. You – it’s a much more organic relationship between comprehending just how much baggage you have, right? It’s like, it’s on my back, it’s squishing my bones, it’s pressing on my shoulders. And the children have the ability to decrease – you know, to take away – like, I asked my son, you know, I’m packing his backpack and then I was like, coming to this discussion of, you know, I don’t actually drink a full bottle of water a day. So I’d like to lighten my load by reducing the amount of water in my bottle to the water that I actually will drink, and I was like, -', 'It was just, I mean – that is a lesson in weight and measure that he came to on his own.', 'This idea – because he has experienced carrying more than he needs, and would like to not do that. And I’m just like, mindlessly filling the bottle full, you know, it’s like, take your water! I’m only going to be gone for a few hours. I know how much water I need. This is how much water I always drink, this is how much water you always pour out, you know, get with the program, mom.', 'Right, I mean – yes. It was just like a, wow! And then there’s a lesson of volume. There’s just so much that came out of that that I really loved.', 'Well, you know, they’re – so they’re little.', 'They’re preschool, yeah, right, right. So I would say that the earlier lessons on math, you know, like – we come – I’m projecting on you. I come from schools where math has been very operational. You know, I’ve memorized these operations and I love them – I’ve memorized these operations and I’ve done them to different degrees and math is a very broad term for lots of different ways of solving a problem on like how things relate to each other, you know. So how things relate to each other’s been reduced to math so you can understand how they relate to each other, you can quantify it. And I would say that your early understandings of math have to do with the ability to see how things relate to each other. So there’s this really cool game that my friend who teaches at a preschool has, and it’s like – it’s like cats. It’s like a box of cats or a jar of plastic cats, and the cats are all different colors, and the cats are all different sizes. And actually, that’s not correct – it’s a box of animals. Different animals, different colors, different sizes. And the first thing that the kids are able to do is really sort these animals by color, so then they’re able to make a pile of blue, and a pile of green and a pile of red. But then if you say something like, sort these animals by type, it’s harder to pick out the cats because the cats are all different colors.', 'So you begin to learn how to sort by different categories, and so that’s – that’s usually the kind of, like, preschool and really even kindergarten math. Also learning how to count, and you’re learning sizes and things. So they get that in the same way only it’s not plastic toys that they’re playing with. It’s be more like, I need four pine cones. Like, if we’re going to make this fire, we need four pine cones. And so the kids, like, run out and they’ll each grab four, you know, and then you’ll have things to count. And then it’s like, oh, you know what, I need something larger. So you learn the concept of things that are larger and smaller, but then you also learn temperature. When is it warmer, and you have a thermometer, and they have a journal. You know, they don’t really know how to write yet, so earlier on the journals are more like drawing pictures of what you see or making maps. How far was that? Did we go farther than last time? How do we know? What are some – what are some external things, like we passed this tree and then this tree and this tree. And then what are some internal things – like, I’m just more tired. Just because you’re more tired, does that mean that you went farther or could there be other reasons why you’re tired?', 'Yes, like, is your mom a jerk and she gave you four pounds of water to carry today?', 'Yeah. And it’s – and then there’s just a lot of respect and respect for other things, and animals, right? They’re constantly looking at animals. And the craziest thing is that I can go on a walk with my just four-year-old. This was when he was 3 ½ and he had only been in the school for a few months. He could point out the – like, he could name the trees.', 'He could name the trees and he could name the plants. Stuff that I had no idea. Our first moment of, like, this trust was this berry – this berry – you know, we’re new here so I don’t know any of the native plants that are here. And he’s like, my daughter was picking some berry because she wants to put every berry in her mouth. And he’s like, oh, she can have that, it’s edible, and I was like, okay, all right, you’re 3, what do you know? And she was like, not even 2 yet. And he was like, turn it, you see this star here? There’s 5 lines and a dot and you turn it over and the leaf looks like it has big, tiger teeth. You know, they use things like that – and I was like, what’s it called? And he’s like, oh, it’s a salal berry. And – and he was like, you know, he was saying, slaaalberry, like I could – I didn’t know what a salal berry was, and I was like, I don’t know! What do we do? Do we question his understanding because we don’t go to outdoor school? I don’t know if you’re right about that – but at the same time, do we want our son to accidentally feed poisonous berries to our daughter? So we just texted the teacher and took a picture of it, and she was like, oh, yes, that’s a salal berry. And I was like, we are at a place where our child knows more than we do, and it’s a constantly – it’s reverse relationship, it’s like, what’s this called? And he’ll say, oh, it’s a dandelion.', 'Worth it, right?', 'So, so – curriculum. If we’re going to talk about curriculum. I feel like his curriculum completely exceeds any expectation that I would have ever had, like, for me I was like, well, he can learn regular stuff later on, You know, after he’s had a couple years being outside – and it’s like, what he knows right now astounds me. And I know every parent, you just don’t expect your – this little bag of blobby bones turns into this thing that knows more than you do and you’re only four years old, and it’s because they are pattern recognition machines and nature and math and even language is all just patterns. And so if you can hone in your pattern recognition skills, if you are given such a broad exposure to patterns because you’re looking at 10,000 things in 3 hours because there are no walls or limitations to your school, and your school is constantly changing with the seasons – what they learn will blow your mind.', 'Yeah.', 'I knew that was coming. I knew that was coming.', 'No, no. I didn’t know that you were saying that. I knew the moment in which they knew more was – I just didn’t realize it would happen before their fourth birthday.', 'Well, our school’s actually –', 'Our school is starting an adult program.', 'Yeah, so nature school. Like, we’re all in school all the time, right? We just call it the Internet.', 'I’m going to Internet – I’m going to school! Facebook, you know. And it’s like, I read 17 articles today, and if you took that hunger for learning and combined it with our hunger for being in nature, which you might not realize you have yet, and marry them together? (whispers) It’s amazing.', 'Well, you know, logistic questions are great. I think the – you want to check this idea that you can be outside too much. That – like, that itself, that’s just a cultural thing, like, won’t you get sick if you’re not inside your house, you know? You don’t want to confuse being inside with rest. You can rest perfectly well outside.', 'Clothes, you have them. But elements, like, again – being outside is not hard on your body. Or, like, like, you will go to do a Crossfit session, and that’s hard on your body, and you’re hard on your body because it brings about an adaptation that you want. Being outside for 8 hours is a load to your body that causes your body to adapt and strengthen to it. So it’s all the same – adaptation just happens the way that it happens, and so you end up getting a body that is well-suited for being outside for extended periods of time. Your erector pili muscles are responsive. Your ability to regulate your temperature is practiced and responsive. Your immune system is strong. You are constantly engaging with the life that’s in the dirt and therefore your body beefs up to be able to survive dealing with all of the organisms that you encounter. Like, you are strengthened by being outside. But then again, don’t confuse that with our need for rest. I mean, humans and adults – like, if I go and spend 6 hours outside, I’m exhausted, which is why I need lots and lots and lots of sleep, which is why kids in outdoor school – mine, I don’t know about other kids – my kids, they’re asleep by 7PM, and they sleep all the way until 6AM.', 'Well, you know what, I’ve never had other kids. I’ve just had my kids and we have lots of friends and their kids will stay up – you know, they take – they’re on different nap and sleeping schedules than our kids, but I think that our kids are fatigued and then need long periods of rest to adapt to long bouts of exposure and so it’s just – fine. You know, also, though, as are the parents – so we ourselves have to go to bed very early because we’re exhausted, because we’ve been outside. You know, you’re working a lot more inches of your body. You’re not necessarily working, you know, your arms and your legs when you’re exercising. Your whole body has been processing information and – but logistically, you know, you can pee outside and then they carry a little squat toilet with them for pooping, because I’m sure, like – that was my thing, I was like, how do they poop? Well, first off what’s really interesting is that kids seem to regulate their – they regulate their bowels so that they go to the bathroom in the morning before school. Like, once they get on a routine, I don’t think that they – I mean, I’m sure that accidents happen or like, I just randomly have to start pooping right now, but –', 'Yes. I have a good story about that, but we’ll save it for another time. You know, if you’re not –', 'No, that’s not romantic. That’s not romantic at all. We’ll save it for the – never mind, I’m stopping right now. Yes, so for the kids they carry a toilet in case of emergencies, you know, a little thing that you sit down and squat, and clean up – but other than that, what else do you need? Kids carry their own food on their back, they bring their own food and water, they take multiple rest breaks. The rest of the time they’re moving, but they’re always outside.', 'Yeah.', 'Yes.', 'Well, I think that there’s two – one, being outside is – I mean, you can, you can look at, it used to be that old, like, you’re cold, stay inside, stay warm, stay covered! Which makes sense, but if you look at the actual data – there’s been a lot of over the past four or five years, like, if you’re sick, you might want to go outside because they found that regular exposure to cold air would actually boost your immune system. But it is also, you know, zoo animals get sick because they’re all too close together touching all the same exact surfaces and you’re not providing a very limited number of surfaces for all children to be wiping their hands and their snot, and you know your sneezes are not kept inside, and you just put them outside and –', 'And that’s what everyone told me, like, oh. And I was like, I just didn’t see it happening, but they’re outside – not just on school days, but almost all of the time. They are almost never inside ever, for the bulk of the day. They are certainly inside every single day for hours, but just compared to the bulk of the day, the bulk of the day is spent outside, and that’s a big deal. So yes, so my mom and my grandmother they’re in that – oh, don’t they just get sick? Aren’t you coming down with colds? And maybe because we call it a cold we associate it with being cold? I don’t know. But. There you go.', 'Yes.', 'Well, gear – so gear is a big deal for nature school. If you’re going to go in year-round elements, and you can – if you just type in “outdoor school” or “nature school” you’re going to find hundreds – I mean, there are a lot more outdoor schools than people realize. A lot of them might be a little more low-profile and operate out of local nature centers or Audubon centers, and the reason I brought that up is because I was thinking, oh, well, we live in the Pacific Northwest, that’s kind of warm-ish compared to, like, Milwaukee or something. But I saw an actual – one woman had blogged about her nature school, and it was in the snow. I mean, these kids are in the snow, so it’s not a fair weather thing, just in the same way that humans for, you know, thousands of years have been outside in all weather. It’s radical only because our minds are kind of shaped by being inside all of the time. It might be done in a different way, and you need high quality gear because kids don’t communicate discomfort in real, like, objective, my feet are cold or I can’t feel – they just whine. You know, they just will behave in a different way, so you have to – every school usually has a requirement of gear. So here, in the wet season, is what we’re always thinking about, I don’t want to say protecting us because – we’re always just – you’re trying to create, um, you’re trying to create clothing that allows as much comfort as possible, and the kids sit right on the ground, so obviously you need some sort of what we call rain gear, but we use Oakiwear. Each school will have a list, and that’s local to Washington.', 'It’s a Vancouver – I think it’s a Vancouver, Washington company, which I didn’t know when we were ordering it. But it’s like, pants, they actually have just like, really thin, flexible rain pants – not, like, over-bulky, because remember –', 'Yes! We could do a whole episode on clothing, but so with rain gear, you don’t just need it to protect you from rain while you’re standing there, it needs to be very malleable. You have to be able to move in it; it has to be able to move with you but also not get hung up while you’re climbing a tree or whatever that you’re doing, and still provide warmth. And so, you know, good socks, shoes that are good at keeping the water out, rain pants, and they wear rain jackets – again, very light, not the bulky rain jacket that an indoor preschool, boots and rain jackets are meant to be worn outside for 30 minutes. Put that on, go outside for recess, and then take it back off, so the consideration of how well you move in it for an extended period of time might not be there because its primary goal is to just keep the water off. So I like Oakiwear because it seems to be designed with keep the water off while moving abundantly for an extended period of time in its design.', 'You’re welcome. And I’m not paid to say any of that.', 'This isn’t a commercial, this is a personal endorsement.', 'Well, I mean, okay, so – go read that Kids Outside book. The Last Kid –', 'Thanks. Sorry, I’m like, I still – just slaughter the names of – Kids Out', 'Kids Outside.', 'Oh, I read that book. Is it called Wild Kids?', 'Scott wrote Wild Kids. Oh my god!', 'Yeah, and I think just – step one is just go outside more. Go outside in whatever way is comfortable to you. Like, you don’t feel comfortable in the rain, don’t worry about it. Just go outside more on the days where it’s not raining, but make sure that you don’t just have lots of reasons of why not to go outside and you just pull out different ones all the time for different scenarios. Like, when you might just not recognize, oh, I really just don’t want to go outside. There’s always going to be a reason to go outside, there’s also just many reasons to go outside, so just pick one, going okay, the next time it is sunny today, we will drop what we’re doing and we will go outside. So someone come up with that, who cares what gear you’re wearing? Just go run around outside. Also, like, a lot of parents will say – especially parents who will come to like, I really like this idea, they’ll be like, I like this idea of nature school but my kid just isn’t really a nature kid – only, really, just because they’ve never been exposed to nature. The parents themselves are uncomfortable. So at our school, there’s almost like a vetting process where you have to come to different – there’s nature school, but there’s also like drop in with the parents once a week nature, like, adventure club is what it’s called here, where they just come and spend a couple hours just roaming, and there’s a teacher leading it but the parents are there. So it’s kind of like a, I never did any of the mommy and me stuff but kind of like that, right? There’s someone leading it but the parents are kind of sitting there, and actually the parents kind of fall away. The more – you know, when you first start you’re kind of holding, like, oh, don’t get in the water! And you can hear a lot of, oh my gosh, don’t, don’t don’t don’t! Don’t do that! But eventually the kids are more afraid to do anything, because they’re like, I don’t know – I feel like everything is dangerous – but then the more they’re there, and everything is very safe – it’s just, it might not feel safe to someone who has never seen their toddler walk over a bed of rocks. Like, if your toddler has only walked on flat and level surfaces in the same way that you learn how to relax with them falling on flat and level surfaces because they just needed to get those muscles – you have to be comfortable letting them fall over rocks until they use different muscles. It’s a whole new walking skill. All of a sudden, all of the muscles and all of the motor programming for walking do not apply to walking over boulders – I’m just talking a river bed.', 'So they’re going to fall and then all of a sudden, parents have got both hands, and it’s like, oh, be careful, be careful! It’s like, once then, though they see that all it takes is a full day – and when I talk about the days of school, they could be 3-4 hours. Adventure club is a couple hours. Once the kids are allowed to get their nature muscles, which really aren’t muscles that only operate in nature, they’re just muscles that operate on different textures and surfaces, right? It’d be like going to the gym and doing bits of cross-training of sorts. Then all of a sudden, they’re stable, they get a little more comfortable, and then all of a sudden they’re like, I want to get on that log because other kids are on that log. Older kids are great hurdle-makers, or – not – they’re like benchmarks, right? They’re like, I want to do that – and then all of a sudden it wouldn’t have occurred to you that climbing up on a log was something you could do until you saw a 4 year old do it, and you’re 2 ½ and you might not reach it, but your arms are stretching up and you’re starting – just like when you first started to do a pull-up, you’re starting the motions of being able to do something, and then one day your leg is long enough and it goes over, and it’s just such a beautiful, organic training platform. And that’s only speaking to the musculo-skeletal side of things. Then there’s all of the mental things that come with competency, and efficacy. And community, and – that is nature. That’s the name of my book.', 'I’m just going to call it,  Nature and Stuff.', 'Kids and Nature and Stuff.', 'In stuff. Yeah. So, yeah. That’s my spiel on nature school. Would you pick nature school for your kids now if they had it? Do they have it there?', 'Absolutely.', 'Yes!', 'And I just wanted to say something about that, like, so I – I had this little note calling just to remind me non-nature outside – so say you are a traditional schoolteacher right now and you’re like, I want to do all these things, but I am limited, really, by the rules of my school. Consider just doing your regular, old curriculum outside – can you go, you know what? We are going to do math outside. It doesn’t have to be a school in or about nature more so than just being outside. The – the walking classroom, they put a lot of that – what do they call that base curriculum? I don’t know what – there’s a term for it, like the base curriculum that grades have, they just put it on tape so the kids just listen to it on a Walkman and go outside and walk around while they’re listening to it.', 'What are you talking about? It’s a Walkman, isn’t it? Like a tape? Like a little tape, a mix tape?', 'What are you talking about?', 'Oh my gosh.', 'Oh.', 'You know, this seals it: we do need to do a show on clothing, because clothing really does limit – I have heard out of the mouth of parents on the playground where we are, it’s like, don’t wreck your clothes. You are going to adjust your behavior to save your clothing, and we could just do, like, Maria VonTrapp and make some clothes out of curtains or something, for the purpose of going outside. You and I – what anniversary is clothes made out of curtains?', 'Okay, so, woo!', 'Yeah, Free Range Kids.', 'It’s super fun right up until CPS calls.', 'They are.', 'But also just this: there’s so many – there’s a ton of resources and we can list them; we could post this on Facebook and get a list going underneath a post, like, post your favorite resource.', 'There’s also something called, like, Let Kids Play, I think?', 'Let the Children Play is a great one.', 'Two things: 1) if you want your kids in nature, just get yourself in nature and the kids will follow. Like, if you – if you want a kid who loves nature, just work on yourself to being someone who loves nature and the kids just seem to follow. And 2) if it all feels so overwhelming right now, just go outside.', 'Just go outside, like that is the largest step, even if it’s just on your front steps or on your front or back lawn. Just go there and sit down on the grass and your kids, as you know, will come lay all over you, but that is so much of what we’re talking about. It really – we can get technical and we can offer so many resources, but in the end it could just be that simple at first. That’s a good first step.', 'Mmm. Sage. My son could probably identify that.', 'I don’t know what it looks like, on the other hand.', 'I think that might be our anniversary present is a review or feedback.', 'Word.', 'Happy anniversary!']}\n",
      "{'DANI': ['A well-oiled Katy machine. Well, it’s good that you are feeling bright and shiny and well-oiled, because this is an important episode. This episode of Katy Says, we are going to focus on building a community around you that helps you and everyone in that community achieve your goals of, like, healthy, happy living.', 'So you don’t have to do all this alone, which is comforting.', 'Mm-hmm. So I had a couple of definitions; you know I like to read from things and sing a lot. I’m not going to sing, but I’m going to read.', 'Okay. There are two definitions of community: 1) a group of people who live in the same place or have a particular characteristic in common, 2) a feeling of fellowship with others as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals.', 'Let’s focus on that latter definition, because we live within communities but we also find communities that share our common interests and attitudes and they don’t live anywhere near us. Sometimes the people that we find are very far away, but we connect with them via things like Facebook, the Google, Big Tent. There are easy ways to find people that you share a common interest with, and people that you resonate with, but we also have great people around us in the proximity. Let’s talk about different ways that you can get it done with the people around you.', 'All right. Let’s see. How can we utilize, and I’m just thinking here, I’m not really asking but if you want to chime in you can.', 'So what are some ways that you can use your community to help you achieve your goals? So let’s just say you have a goal of, I want to walk more.', 'In your proximity.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Which is brilliant, if you don’t have local walkers, yeah.', 'That’s great.', 'Well, because believe it or not, I don’t really like to talk much.', 'I could just duck behind; pretend I’m tying my shoe while the bullets fly.', 'No, I love my walking buddies. Walking buddies, if you’re listening, I would never, ever hold you in front of me in the presence of gunfire. We would just both run together. So, you know, that’s what trees are for. So I would never do that. Yeah, and that’s how I found my walking buddies was just local Facebook pals.', 'But I do have a friend who does the phone call. She gets up every morning, her friend’s in a different time zone, and they get on their phones with their headsets and take off walking. So it’s that commitment, and that’s a big part of that –', '-- is when you engage a community around you, for you to all get stuff done or to live the lifestyle that you want, you’re making a commitment.', 'Right. Walking buddies are great. Well, how about you share, because really, this whole show was inspired by you because you have inspired me to do these different kinds of things and more in my community. So would you share some examples of how you have used your community in the past to get – to git ‘er done?', 'I like your dinners.', 'But you’ve done all sorts of things.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Right, well, we just have a one day a week meeting planned and the list of all the parks is there because I’m a little more – I’m not so good at the fly by the seat of the pants, I gotta kinda know, Wednesday’s the day. So yeah, we started this community – just invited everybody in, you either come or you don’t. It’s not a potluck in this instance, you know, so it’s just you bring food, if you want to share, you can share. But you don’t have to, because we didn’t want people to feel that –', '-- that restraint. And then that’s it. And it just goes all for us through the spring and summer, through the fall, when it starts to get snowy, because nobody really wants to sit on the ground. But I just love that idea, and you have inspired us to do that and everybody that has joined our community here locally – we call it summer dine – but because I also like to name things. I have a proclivity for naming things.', 'Yes. Thank you. But it’s because of you – I mean, it’s a brilliant idea, and it’s not just – it’s getting you outside, it’s letting your kids play with people, it’s letting you see, as you said, the people that you like, and also making new friends. For us, that was a big part of it, was meeting more people in the community that I may just know through Facebook locally, or that know a friend of a friend. But also – yeah, that outside time is big.', 'I bet they loved that invitation. That was probably awesome for them.', 'Oh, man, that’s wild. That’s like the ‘70s at your house, man, that’s crazy.', 'That’s pretty cool. That’s an awesome story.', 'Soup! Say, it’s soup night, why don’t you come on over?', 'Oh, that’s very neat.', 'That’s great, and it’s just yeah, that commitment to yourself – everybody around you and yourself.', 'Which I like because one of the things that we have kind of put out there with our summertime thing is that even if just you show up and nobody else shows up, you are outside.', 'That you’ve got 30 people around you or just you around you, but you guys are outside, eating your meal outside and climbing on monkey bars. Thank you for that, I just love that idea.', 'And it was your idea. It was a good idea. But – and then there’s smaller ways, too. Like, you don’t have to have a big old soup night or sort of a community potluck, but you can just figure out ways to share in your community. Like, don’t you do a lot of childcare/bone broth kind of things?', 'They actually, the children make delicious bone broth. I mean, you should see my hair and nails. Fantastic.', '(cackles)', 'Hey, listeners – I don’t eat kids. But anyway.', 'I did.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yeah.', 'Right.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'But I love it, because there’s really no – it does not cost a lot at all. It costs nothing, and it’s brilliant.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah. And there’s kind of even organized ways that people do that like with the Buy Nothing communities and time banks. If you go to timebanks.org there’s people that just share time for time. So if you’re really good at plumbing, you give somebody an hour’s worth of plumbing and then they can go into the bank and, you know, take that hour’s worth of plumbing, but then they’ve got to give an hour’s worth of childcare or bookkeeping. It’s time for time, so. There’s just –', 'Right, and I think you’ve really hit the nail on the head when you said people just don’t want to ask for stuff, because that dollar prevents them – if you have the dollar, you don’t have to ask. But if you could just get over that step and ask for something, that’s the key and that’s very cool.', 'Right.', 'Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I had a friend who suggested that we start like a gardening or weeding club, and a cleaning – spring cleaning club. So you’ve got 4 people, you spend an hour at everybody’s house, so you’ve still spent the 4 hours that you would be spending at your own house doing it, but you’re doing it for everybody and with everybody. You’re still getting the same job done.', 'Absolutely.', 'Yeah. I mean, working by yourself is way different on those kind of tasks than when you’re surrounded by other people. Way different.', 'Freeing up is free.', 'It’s brilliant. I get so excited when we talk about this kind of stuff. Um, and you had another idea – something you introduced me to the last time we spoke was a book sharing community? You know, where you share books, which is also awesome? Because sometimes the lines can get very long at the library if you’re waiting on some books.', 'That is a really long time.', 'Renewal.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Just, just – folks, look up book and sharing and I’m sure –', 'And, uh, shoe sharing, that was another really good idea that you had. When people are looking to – for outfitting their kids in more minimal, which can sometime be expensive, or any shoe, really, but minimal shoes – kids just don’t wear them out. Their little feet grow too quickly.', 'Mm-hmm. That’s a great idea. Yeah, and you’re never really going to recoup your costs on those things so you might as well just spread the love and let everybody get use out of them.', 'That’s true.', 'That’s true. That’s a good way to look at it. I have something kind of neat that I want to share – that somebody in our online community started, and she gave me permission to use her name, so we’ll just call her Breena. She started a thing – she asked, she had the guts to go out there in her community and ask, and she said, I need somebody to meet with me via Skype or whatever once a week to be my accountability partner. Of course, 100 people stepped up and went, that’s a really good idea! And we have changed it so – I’ve nicknamed it Accountabilibuddy, so we have Accountabilibuddies. And once or twice a week, depending on how many buddies you have, we meet via Skype at a certain time so they are scheduled then, it’s not just random, like every Tuesday from 7:30-8:30 AM that’s our time together. You can do it with people in different time zones, and we meet via Skype, we talk for 3 minutes about what are you going to do in this next hour? And then you do that thing. And it really prevents you from goofing off or checking Facebook – it’s, you get it done because you know that somebody’s counting on you at the end of that hour to report back to them. And it has been hugely successful for everybody that I’ve talked with that has participated in it. It costs nothing. All of us are getting things done. One of my partners got something done – she’s waited 8 years since she’s had kids to get done, and in that one hour she got it done.', 'It was – uh, yeah – it was cleaning out – her computer was so slow, that it was just sitting down, and she works at home and raises her kids at home, and this has never – it’s like one of those back burner things, like I gotta do it. But that’s the cool thing about this is that you can ask for somebody to meet with you virtually or whatever and you can just do whatever you want to do, but then when you report back to them, they feel good, you feel good.', 'I got something done. I get something done every time, it’s amazing. Like, I cleaned out a file or a wrote a blog post. I worked on a novel. It’s – and I have one that she just does – she’s really prolific writer, but she doesn’t get enough movement in for her happiness level. So it’s funny watching her face when we check in by Skype at the beginning. What are you going to do today? I’m going to move. And then in 60 minutes we check in again and she looks like the happiest person in the world.', 'And that’s the best part is seeing her face. It even overrides my own happiness at my own accomplishments because, you know, she did that and – so – it’s brought a bunch of us closer together, and none of us live next door to each other, and I think that that’s – there’s so many different ways that you can ask for what you need and offer what you can give to make things work for everybody.', 'Mm-hmm. Community is fantastic.', 'Yes. Yes, it was helpful for me. And if anyone wants to share their ideas, too, their own ideas that they’re using, because I’m sure there’s a million. And really you – you inspired all this in me, so, thanks, Katy.', 'All right. I just want to remind everybody: thank you always for listening. We appreciate it. If you ever want to ask a question to be featured on the podcast, or if you want to focus on something, you can go to KatySays.com and there’s little widgets there where you can actually record your question or you can type it in if you’re just one of those quiet types, and as always, we love your reviews on iTunes and Stitchr. It helps us make a better podcast for you. That’s all I have to say, how about you?', 'You’re spent. Well, I appreciate, as always, sharing time with you, and I hope you have.', 'It is, I really do look forward – I always learn so much with you. So, thank you for your time. I hope the rest of your day is shiny and happy.', 'And slick.', 'Well-oiled machine, keeping it real. All right.', 'Thanks, Katy.'], 'KATY': ['All right.', 'Yeah, and it might almost be too hard to do alone. Maybe a community might be the solution.', 'All right, do it.', 'Ooh.', 'All right.', 'Okay.', 'Well, I think we did another show – it’s like, go right now to Facebook, where hopefully you have some friends local to you. And in this case it would be that first definition of community where people have to be –', 'Maybe, perhaps close.', 'In your same area. “I need a walking buddy.” Put the time that you want to walk and the distance you want to walk and be like, I’m looking for a walking partner, and you will find that magical one. And that could be one way, or maybe you make a phone appointment with a friend – like maybe you don’t have someone near you but you have someone who will get up every day and will talk with you on the phone while you go for a walk.', 'Which is another idea.', 'Although you were saying that you actually use – you – that you use your walking buddies essentially as protection from scary things, which I would, like, before it made sense and now that I think about it, it’s like, that’s very interesting, so, so, yes – okay.', 'So you just need someone to act like a bulletproof vest, it’s like; can you just walk around me?', 'There you go.', 'Yeah, me too.', 'Yeah', 'Yeah, you are responsible for doing your part and someone else holds you accountable, although I think you probably hold yourself more accountable to someone else than maybe to yourself, so. Walking buddies are fabulous.', 'Yeah, well, I think the biggest – like are you talking about our dinners?', 'Well, the dinner one is the big one.', 'I do a lot of stuff, yeah. Creating community seems to be what I like to do quite a lot of. I thrive in a community, I thrive with shared responsibility. Like, I recognize that I am really good at one thing but not necessarily really good at many other things, and everyone has this amazing skill set that I just love to bask in. I love to bask in other peoples’ amazing skills, but only when you get together collectively do you recognize that oh, you don’t have to do it all. So one of the things – like, I’m always looking for more outside time. You know, we did a whole show on nature school and we talked about, like, our family spends quite a bit of time outside, but there are these things that force you inside, like cooking and meals a lot of times, and the fact that, okay, your kids have been around just you for the bulk of the day and they’re done with that, you are no longer interesting and they’re bored or whatever. So our meal nights kind of came about, like, I’m a fast cooker. If I’m making something, I can usually make a lot of it, or sometimes I’ll have just a little – enough food for a little dish and I don’t want to spend time to go to the grocery store but I could make a salad or I could whip up just burgers or – and I would just put a text out, going, we are going to this park. And we are bringing a dish of food. If everyone just brings a dish of food from whatever they have in their refrigerator right now, meet here and then the kids just go run off and play, it’s like fresh legs, right?', 'Fresh legs, everyone’s here, and they’re like, what! All my friends, I’m so excited! And we’re hanging out with the people that we adore. We are also hanging on the monkey bars and swinging and going for a little walk and we end up getting two more hours of outside time, plus I didn’t have to spend the time going to the grocery store or cleaning up after a big meal. Everything’s just outside and that – doing that like 3 times a week is huge. And you had actually, I think, did something similar but you actually started a page for it – like, a Facebook page of here’s where we’re meeting and you invited a lot of people so that attendees could just cycle based on who was digging it that day?', 'Yeah.', 'You are very good at naming things. Your children have amazing names.', 'Well, and one time, we do have – we do a winter version of it where it’s inside, where we just call it like a soup night. One family will make the soup and everyone goes to that house for that Friday night or Wednesday night or whatever night you pick, and then all the kids are just – they’re just gone. And like, your house is just destroyed. Because all the toys are out, all the clothes are out – whatever – but, like, you just get 3 hours or 2 hours of just this chill kind of hang out vibe, and then you get to go to someone else’s house and do it 3 other times that month in exchange for that one thing is 3 times when you don’t have that. And one time we were at a park and there was a family there who was traveling, they were like – they were just traveling here. We just invited them. We were like, you guys look like you could use a home-cooked meal, and you know what, when you’re traveling with kids, you know, it’s like your kids have only played with your kids while you’re on the road. We’re on the road a lot and I just thought, I know what that feels like. These kids had actually – this family had come down to where we had our nature school which was just closing up, so we had a, you know, 10 minutes of having lunch next to them. And they ended up coming, and it was just like –', 'Well, it was awkward, I’m sure, because here’s this strange person, you know me, I’m like, do you guys want to come over for dinner tonight? Why don’t you come over for dinner tonight. You know? And I said, it’s – we had all of our friends here, so it ended up being like 40 people in our house, but their kids – like kids do – boom, gone. Playing, playing, playing. You know, the parents just got a few hour mental break and the food – and they brought this amazing, like, I think they brought like a cole slaw, and it – the evening just ended up like it always does with everyone doing calf stretches, you know, in the living room, and yeah.', 'It wasn’t like the ‘70s in my house. It wasn’t. It was just – there were no Bosu in the ‘70s, and I had like the guy on the Bosu – it was awesome. And I guess, like, people – I just love that sense of community. Like, that connected me to someone who lived in a completely different side of the United States, and I just like people. I like connection, and I like assuming the best out of everybody. You know, everyone’s like, why do you invite, like, how would you know? And I was like, because, like, anyone who would come would – if you say yes to that invitation, you’re going to be cool and it’s going to be awesome. And it was. It was a magical day.', 'So go out to your park right now and invite someone over for dinner.', 'Well, the soup night that we – when we first moved to this town, the soup night was already in effect with another group. And the rules of soup night were: you had to have small children, and you were allowed to bring in someone – like, you should bring someone new into the group.', 'Yes, and so when we were moving here, we knew nobody with small children and the first one we went to, there was like 30 adults and 50 kids. There were so many kids. But it wasn’t like, ugh, just the relaxation of moving to a place, knowing nobody, and then we didn’t really end up bonding so much with that one, but we took the idea with the people that you eventually make as your friends. But it was still – we still made some nice friends, but then with our friends who we’ve really come to love and, you know, who are really at the center of our tribe, we do it on a much more regular basis. Weekly, if not 2 or 3 times a week.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'You’re welcome.', 'Nah, well, I don’t do any childcare with my bone broth, though. I tried to get bone broth to watch my kids once and it didn’t turn out well.', 'It’s like  Hansel and Gretel  right now, what is happening?', 'This is Hansel and Gretel broth.', 'What do you have against goats, anyway? One of the – I guess one of the other community – did you snort?', 'One of the – hey, I guess when we go back to natural movement which is the umbrella which all this stuff kind of falls, there’s recommendations about what kids need and what teenagers and adults need, and it’s very – one of the limiting factors of getting what you need is, you know, the society in which we live, which is – you know, the nuclear family, and then usually the single-parent nuclear family for the bulk of the day because someone’s working or both people are working and there’s just not the luxury of being able to go take a 5-mile walk for 5 hours, even though everyone wants to do, perhaps, a version of that. Or would like to do more outside, but there’s just not the time. And one of the things that the community that we have worked to develop involves, you know – hiring babysitters is expensive.', 'Which I did not realize. I haven’t had my first for-pay babysitter, but like, you know, you go out with other friends who have kids who are a bit older and they’re like, that was like $40. That’s expensive, it’s very limiting.', 'However, we have friends who had 10 year olds and 11 year olds and 12 year olds who are at this age where they want to be out of their home. They’re like, I’m not interested in being in my house anymore because there’s a particular dynamic, but they would love to come over here and be in charge of smaller kids and the kids love having these – you know – slightly older children in charge of them, and we’ve done it with kids as young as 8. I have nieces and nephews and we have neighbors and so in the end, the mom who – like, the single mom – who, you know, is struggling to figure out that she didn’t want her daughter to go home after school to be by herself, but at the same time the daughter didn’t want to go to daycare, you know, because she’s too old. She’s 10 or 11.', 'I needed to hire someone, you know, for a couple hours after school at the end of the day when the kids are done with me and I am done with them, just – I don’t mean that in a bad way, but in a way hopefully every parent can relate to, it’s like, there’s nothing happening in this exchange right now.', 'And I was just – little things like that, like how about 2 days a week your daughter comes over here and works for us, and in exchange, I send your daughter home with a casserole. So now, the mom didn’t have to pay for childcare, I didn’t have to pay for childcare, the mom doesn’t have to come home and figure out what to make, her daughter gets to take home a nutritious meal, because even just cooking dinner which I was going to do anyway is just this relaxing, enjoyable thing for me to do. I’m making – like do you see how, like –', '-- that – that right there could save lives. I mean, everyone –', 'Like, it’s just – it’s equal to the food that gets thrown away, and it’s just – it’s just this – my husband was kind of talking about it, and he said, I feel like, people are afraid to ask to borrow. To take something without exchanging money, like if you want a tool, you don’t want to ask someone to borrow it, you just go buy it yourself. Because you don’t want to, like, inconvenience the person and then what if you break it? And then the person is like, well, what if someone breaks the thing that I lend them? And so eventually, just, no one shares. Everyone has a garage full of tools that almost 100% of the time are unused, like, you can only use a thing at a time, and so everyone then has to buy them. And then, that’s kind of like what I think is driving consumerism as a whole, is we don’t live in a community that shares a single set of things. And if you just kind of really approach – all right, you can have pretty much – if you came over, there wasn’t anything in my house that I wouldn’t let you have, I would say, with the exception of my children, and even then, I would give them to you for like a short period of time if you really wanted them. I think that that – if you’re trying to figure out how to get more movement into your life, whether you’re talking about getting more movement for the kids or just for yourself: I need a break, I need a 5-mile walk, adult-paced, by myself – that there is a way to sculpt that out for you, and so that was just one solution of how I’ve used community. People are like, you do a tremendous – I do a tremendous amount of work. It’s not people saying it. I do a tremendous amount of work, but what you don’t see is me leverage a willing community and them leverage me right back. That I am just really open to anything that I can do for you. And then it took me a little while to learn how to ask for what I could use people to do for me. It was great – and then you’ve got, I mean, just the dinner thing. I keep coming back to the dinner, but dinner is stressful. All meals are stressful. Getting breakfast, getting lunch, getting dinner made – that’s such a huge, time-consuming, and you know, co-ops of gardening co-ops where you just come together and swap food. You don’t even have to go buy produce. Someone started in the town I lived in before, she started a Sunday garden produce: bring your eggs, bring your whatever. If you have eggs? I don’t see why you ever have to cook for yourself. Just be like, I’ll give you this carton of eggs, if you have chickens, I’ll give you this carton of eggs if you turn this carton of eggs and all these other vegetables – because I love gardening but I don’t love cooking so much – can you turn that into a quiche? It’s like amazing.', 'I’ll do that. Because I’m going to – once I chop everything, I might as well just make 2 quiches and I’ve got all these eggs! Like, think in terms of that and I think you’ll be the healthier for it in the long run.', 'What if you just – what if you just did that on your Facebook, again, or just go, I can do this – this is what I can do for an hour. I can teach an exercise class, so if I lead – if I teach a yoga class, these 2 mornings and it doesn’t cost you anything, does anyone have anything else that they’d like to put up? And just think outside – or teach a class for food. If you were a – like, if you’re a movement teacher, why not have one of your classes once a week instead of it being for money, why don’t you say, everyone should just bring one home-baked thing, or bring a food product. Something that someone already has, you know, that just goes unused and then all of a sudden, instead of getting money to then having to go spend time to buy food, the food just came to you. It was a more direct exchange and a representation of our skillset. Like, our skillsets are reduced down to dollars, which then – the dollars – the dollar is the middle man instead of a real good, this is my joy. This is my offering. And then someone can accept your offering for what it is without it having to be converted first. So, I don’t know.', 'Well, communities – a community or tribe is made of people, and so – so to find your tribe, you know, if you’re putting a dollar barrier, maybe, in front of who you are it might be more difficult to find the people who are interested in what you have to offer. And likewise, more difficult to find people who have things you are interested in.', 'So if you strip that away a little bit, it’s like, oh! I see right now that you and I could be in a reciprocal relationship so easily. So – so simply, without having it to be five steps separated.', 'Yes, and then it’s you working for four hours is different than four people coming over and getting that job turned over in an hour.', 'You know, that reminds me, there was another group in Portland, I think, where it was a group of families, maybe 4 or 5 – I think – it might have been 4 or 5 – and they cycled through each others’ homes one weekend day. And if it was your day to have people at your house, all you had to do was provide the lunch, and you know, some drinks and snacks for that day – for that 6 hour period, and they would do whatever task you had them do when it was your day. You were trimming your trees, you’re cleaning out an attic, you’re packing because you were moving, you were – whatever – you’re painting your house. It doesn’t matter. There was nothing except, let us know how we need to dress, essentially, and then that was it. And you got all of that labor, but more importantly, you had all of that fun and friendship, you know?', 'And you have to work and take care of your kids, so you have to do two jobs. But the kids all take care of each other, like herd mentality, right? They’re out doing stuff, and we just did this with our friends’ lavender farm. They’re like, we are young, struggling farmers with young kids, we need to plant 2,000 lavender plants and they need to go in the ground by this time. And with the two of them, there would have been no way they could have done it. So we’ll buy you lunch – and it was the most awesome day, right? I did easily 500 squats and bent over. Things that I would have wanted to do anyway, I was out in the sun, barefoot, feet in the dirt, with all of my friends that I love. My kids – I did not see my children for 5 hours. They were just running around on the property, on the back side of the property, and again – with 15 children. We saw them when they came out for lunch. But it was a magical, sunny, amazing day. Music, just as good as going to a party, only they got their lavender field planted.

Because you get so many shoes, you get them as gifts, and – or you find something, like, I’m constantly – I’ll buy minimal shoes anytime I’m at a thrift store and I find a good pair that is clearly – I’ll just buy them, because I know that I have someone in my community who will want them.

And it’s a good thing.', 'Where they were kind of articulated? Or…', 'Oh, really? KATY: Yeah, but I wonder if there were also Barbies with knees, but what does Barbie?

We could just – we could do a whole show on our toys of the ‘70s and ‘80s. But let’s move forward.', 'All this new stuff. What else happened the last couple weeks? KATY: Well, the other big one – big article, big news piece – was Esther Gokhale, who is a Bay Area, kind of alignment specialist. She has really been doing this work about looking at different populations of people and how they move, and looking at their rates of back pain, and she has a whole program for correcting your body posture, and therefore feeling better, I guess, in your body. And she has a great book – I think it’s like  Eight Steps to a Pain Free Back. \\xa0 DANI: Yeah.', 'A lot of people were talking about that in a lot of different professions.', 'That was huge.', 'Before. And I actually, I listen to NPR One, which is an NPR app that you can actually pick the stories you want and then it kind of gives you stuff about what you’ve been listening to, you know, kind of like Pandora.

But – what you said was good, and it was a good way to look at it. It’s really easy always to boil these things down with headlines, and so I like, in the way that you do, you make us think deeper than what’s just on the surface. So I’m sure you made me smarter. Here’s what you said about the J-shaped spine: “Being observed here are bodies, not spines. What’s being seen as a J-shaped spine is more of a J-shaped backside with butt muscles included. There are no measures of spines here, but an observation of whole body mass distribution. Do I think improved core and glute mass will decrease back pain? In most cases, I do. Do I think there are positions that; when you move through them, assist the development of that mass? I do. Do I think that taking your current spine and forcing it into a J-shape is the equivalent of moving it in a way that has resulted in a J-shape backside mass distribution? No, I do not. Still, postural adjustment is a step toward using your body differently when you move, which will result in different mass distribution.” And this is stuff you’ve been talking about for years through  Alignment Matters  and  Move Your DNA.  “I think the takeaway here is: don’t assume the outcome of a behavior (the shape of the body) is more valuable than the behavior that facilitated it.” Because people would read that – like, you’d read that, and you’d think, oh, I have to hold my spine in this J-shape to prevent, you know, to get rid of my back pain or to prevent my back pain.

I was disappointed like many people were at this article, because you usually have higher expectations for this certain publication. But uh, they basically – no. Not basically. Here’s exactly what they did. They took these students –', 'No, no, no. It was – Han – Hanseo? I don’t know how to say it. Hanseo University in South Korea, they took these young women that were at the University that were studying to become airline attendants, and apparently you have to study a long time to do this there. And they were actually required to wear high heels to class since they would always have to wear them if they got hired by a Korean airline. So they started studying the freshmen, the incoming freshmen, to the seniors, because each class would have an additional year of heel wearing behind them, and that’s making it easy to track physiological changes. So there were just 10 women from each class that they invited to the lab, and they tested their balance with a wobbly board, and the strength of their ankle muscles using computerized exercise machines. So in the beginning, I guess, everything kind of adapted, these muscles, and they said that the freshmen, sophomores, and juniors had greater strength in some of the muscles around their ankles, and then the seniors, who had been wearing the high heels the longest, showed weakening in those same muscles, compared even to the freshmen, who were new to the heels. So – this is the study, essentially, was this study with these four years of – and I don’t know how long the study itself went on. It was not in the article.', 'Well, how long was the study?', 'Excuse me, are you Science, or  Ms.  Science?', 'Now, that’s an article I’ll stand behind!', 'Apparently it can be done.', 'Right.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Oh, so they didn’t follow the women.', 'No.', 'Well, the takeaway was they – none of the doctors that – there was a biology professor and then this doctor – suggested that women, you know, avoid heels.', 'They just said, uh.', 'And then he dropped the mic and walked out of the room.', 'Um – that – that Science.', 'Yes. That Science.

I’m more of the devil’s advocate and I don’t just take everything at face value and I’m getting better at it. I still kind of do – you know, I see Science weighs in on high heels and I just sit there with my chin in my hands and wait for Science to tell me what it is I want to hear.

So you had a shoe store and a salon, and you would get ready. And then you would have to make it home before the hour was up, which went by really fast, because if you had to play for an actual hour that would be tedious. But you’d go in and she would have, like, different styles, different colored hair, different bikinis. I don’t even think there was a one-piece. You had to pick a bikini.

And she has a great book – I think it’s like  Eight Steps to a Pain Free Back.', 'Anyway, she’s been around for a really long time and has gained lots of traction, but they did an NPR piece on her and the way that the article was written up, seemed more to be more about the idea of a J-shaped spine. So if you want to go search the article, you’ll probably find it by searching J-shaped spine. And, um, that went kind of wild, that was a big –', 'Yeah, yeah.', 'Yeah, and I think the article, you know, you’re looking for kind of a hook to the article. It seemed to be less about Esther’s work and more about this idea that an S-shaped spine, right? So an S-shaped spine to just give a brief anatomical picture, would be a slight curve at the cervical spine, so that cervical spine is the top of your spine, close to your head. And then another curve over the thoracic spine between your shoulder blades, and then one more curve going in the opposite direction, right? So these curves are opposing, right? You have a curve in one way, a curve in the other way, and then a slight curve in the other way down at your lower back. So the understanding in anatomy, in general, is that the spine itself sits as an S because that orientation of vertebrae loads the discs when you are upright in a particular way that is best for the back. So it’s kind of this alignment, mechanical idea. Of course, the spine doesn’t have a particular shape because it’s made up of a bunch of smaller pieces, so your spine has many shapes throughout the day, right? Every time you go move around. Like, if you cut your spine out of your back, it does not sit in an S shape nor does if you cut the spine out of the back of the people who are in –', 'Well, it’s the same thing with the arch in the foot, right? Like, people think that there’s – that there’s a structure –', '-- in your foot that is shaped like an arch that has broken down. And that’s not – that’s not how it works. The shape of something is the sum total of the behavior of the things. Like, you’re an active, dynamic creature, and so your shape is a moment-to-moment thing. So there is no J-shaped spine or S-shaped spine as a structure. Although, when you look at anatomy books or articles like this, what you’re looking at is drawings. You’re looking at just drawings of people who are trying to create a model of the spine, and they’re like, look, see, this has an S-shape, and then look at this spine, here is a J-shape. So I think that those people were asking my input from the, ‘is it true, that we have a J-shaped spine?’ And it’s like, well, no, there is no spinal shape. What they’re talking about would be what I assume is the most amount of time – how the bones are positioned relative to each other, so that’s one thing. And – you want me to just read my commentary?', 'I think it’d be better if you read it. Because then it’s just a little tedious if it’s my voice and my words.', 'No. Well, I was just going to say, before we go onto the body stuff, is that the thing that I appreciated most that you just read is that you corrected all of my grammatical errors.', 'I know! It is so much better!', 'You know, I was reading along as you were reading it and I was like, oh, she just corrected that error. Oh! She just corrected that error. It’s like second nature to you.', 'I love it! I’m going to just have you speak on my behalf from now on. It’ll be Katy Says, featuring Dani Hemmat, only. I’ll just write my answers and you can read them correctly.', 'But yes, okay, so that was – that was the thing, was that – and I think that the article – maybe the headline or the broad gist of the article didn’t acknowledge what I just talked about here, but the contents of the article, I think, did if you read it a few times you’ll see that what we were talking about was covered.', 'First of all, there was no actual measuring of spines. What they’re looking at are people who move in a particular way, who anecdotally have reports of low incidences of back pain, and you’re going, oh! Well, look at the shape of their spine – it’s like a J, not like an S. So the first thing that the article said was that most Americans have an S-shaped spine, and I was like, okay, that – I would disagree with that. I haven’t worked with most Americans, but I’ve worked with a very large population of people who have back pain, and one of the things with back pain research as a whole is that when there are problems with these curves, whether there’s not enough curve – then that’s when ailments tend to arise, because of the way that people are moving. Not because of the curve itself, but because of how you move with the curve, the way that the loads to different parts of your body ensue, that there’s a repetitious kind of break down. There are positions in which you are stronger, and positions in which you are weaker, where they’ve pulled out hunks of spine, you know, everything’s reduced – they’ve pulled out hunks of spine, compressed it and twist it and see the loads, because it’s just a machine.', 'And they’re like, we’re going to add, you know, 10 Newtons of force, and we’re going to squish it and twist it, and then we’re going to add the same amount of force but we’re going to flex a little bit and then smash it and then twist it. And then they can see at what angles the same 10 Newtons does the most damage, and then those become the parameters for then, well, keep your back in this particular curve or whatever as you’re bending or twisting, because this will do the least damage theoretically. Of course, the issue being you’re never just smashing and twisting a spine: you have a particular amount of muscle that’s resisting all of that. So, like, that’s the issue, I think, with –', 'With ergonomics, or – or looking for positions that are better or worse for you is usually that there’s some sort of reduced tissue. I mean, it’s as close as you’re going to get, right? It’s the way that it has to be done, but you don’t necessarily want to take it as, you know, gospel, or assign words to it, like “the truth” because it is a reduced model. So anyway, when I look at the pictures of – or at, you know, depths of research and people who have a particular lifestyle, and their anthropometric dimensions, which is a fancy word for the lengths and girth of their different shape, whether you’re measuring their bones or in this case you’re just looking at a body. You’re looking at a body and you go, see? There’s not really an “S” here; it’s straight down and swoops off the back –', 'And it’s like, well, okay, the “J” is created by how much butt mass you have. That is not a spinal curve. Your – you know, if you’re looking at someone whose got a nice set of glutes –', 'Yes!', 'When I look at Dani and I’m like, “Look at that J-shaped spine!” The song would just not be as good. I like J-spines! \\xa0 \\xa0 KATY: Man, we’re stuck in, like, the 90s. This was the retro show is what this is!', 'You know.', 'We’re living in the past!', 'Well, maybe – maybe when you focus a lot on the mass behind you, you just look back metaphorically, physically, all of it.', 'Thank you.', 'As is your J-shaped spine.', 'But anyway, so when you’re looking at – you can’t compare – well, you can, but there’s difficulties that arise when you’re going to compare an S-shaped theoretical spine outside of a body and a J-shaped one. I would wager that if you were to actually take clinical measurements comparing spinal curvature that there’s not a vast difference in spinal curvature as much as there is a difference in mass distribution, meaning that the people who have less back pain – the people who they’re looking at who have this so-called J-shaped spine just have such a nice, well-balanced distribution of mass around their core and backside that creates a particular look “to the spine.” That’s one of my bigger issues – you know, you’ve taken my courses – about – that measure – that we’ve gotten really lax about measures.', 'So spinal curve is one of those weird things. You can do, you know, a “clinical measurement” of someone’s spinal curvature, but all you’re really doing is just setting a line upon someone’s back. Like, if I have, um – I have the flexi-curve. Flexi-curves are in research is what is the easiest way to take a spinal measure in a community-screening kind of way. You know, you’re not looking at a side view of an x-ray.', 'It is – well, here’s a funny story. When I was doing my graduate research, I was looking at ways to reduce symptoms of pelvic floor disorder was my thesis project, through different corrective exercises. So I took measures of spines before and after because spinal curvature, there’s a particular spinal curvature that is itself a particular risk factor. So I wanted to see, can we change, you know, spinal curvature? So I was reading all the literature. When you’re doing a research project, even the method that you use – like I’m going to use this flexi-curve measure – hast to be tested – is hopefully tested by someone else. Like, you can’t use a method that hasn’t been established to have a particular validity.', 'Yes, right? And if it doesn’t, then the research you could do would be just testing the reliability of a measure. That itself is a piece of research that is assembled into other research moving forward. So I had found – because I needed a way, an inexpensive way, to measure the spines of 50 people, you know, so people were like, why don’t you use things like, you know, things that have a higher value or accuracy? It’s like, because those things are expensive, and we can’t pay $700 for everyone to get 2 x-rays and then an x-ray lying down doesn’t really show you very much about upper – anyway. So I found this, I had picked out my tool as a flex-curve, but I could not find one. So it’s like, I’m searching the Internet for flexi-curves, it’s like, where is the flexi-curve, it’s some tool, I’m emailing the researchers who did it, like, where did you get this flexi-curve. And no one’s emailing me back, and it’s time for my study to start – only to find out, talking to a client at the time, and the guy’s like, I think that they just mean it’s a flexible ruler.', 'It’s a ruler – that he’s like, “You can go get it at Home Depot, I think they’re like $10.” I was like, here I am thinking that it’s some sort of, like, technical thing because, you know, because of jargon –', 'They have to write all of these research articles so jargon-heavy that you can’t even recognize – or they don’t even add a picture – that what they’re describing is simply a flexible ruler from Office Depot for $10.', 'It does. It does. It’s a flexible – it’s I almost added a curse word right there – it’s a flex – it’s an effing ruler! Meaning flexible! It’s a flexible ruler! And, uh, yeah, and it’s awesome.', 'I did.', 'And I went and bought one that day. I actually bought 3. I always have one on hand because it’s the easiest way to show how I could trace a curve on your spine or on my spine – you just lay it along someone’s back – and then, um –', 'It’s not – it’s got a long – it’s better than Barbie’s knees.', 'When you saw my flexi-curve?', 'Um, from the – it’s like, I remember when I was in an undergrad we had to measure body fat –', 'We had to measure body fat in undergrad, and there was like, this tool, you know, it’s just a caliper, and I was like, they should call it a – it’s called Fat-O-Meter was the name of it. I was like, no, this is a (pronounces Fat-o-meter as) fatometer.', 'Yes, the fatometer. Fat-O-Meter was the name of the –', '-- was the brand name. So I just started calling it a fatometer much to everyone’s delight. Get the fatometer and the flexi-rule and call it your tool bag. Anyway, an article, a research article that I’m actually working on now is to show how – this is a podcast that would do really well with a video companion and some brief lessons on area. But anyway, a long story short, it’s very easy for you to, by standing, change your spinal curvature to look like an S, or to look like a J, but it’s not the spinal curvature that’s really of importance when it comes to loads. Or I should say, it’s not only. The curve – the S-curve, when we’re considering an S-curve, what makes the S-curve of a value is that the vertebrae sit in a particular way in this S-curve. The S-curve, you notice, we use S-curve and J-curve because it’s impossible to actually put numerical values on a curve because everyone has a different set of anthropometric dimensions. So you can’t say that a spine should have this certain amount of degrees because the taller you are, or the smaller you are, those degrees would – like, your spine is not a single set of angles that just gets bigger and bigger and bigger as you get bigger. The curves are offsetting what’s happening in your whole entire body. So your spinal curvature as an adult is not the same spinal curvature that you have as a younger person because your segment weights are different.', 'So there’s a relative neutral for everyone, but not an absolute neutral for everyone numerically. So that’s why we use things like S-shaped spine. What we really mean is that there is a neutral to your spine in which all of the vertebrae themselves are in a neutral position. But I can make an S – I can get the flexi-curve on my back to get an S or a J or whatever by changing the position of my vertebrae relative to each other and could achieve a J-measure or an S-measure, but not have a neutral, healthy spine in either case. I really wanted to – to bring home this deer spine. I found a whole, entire deer skeleton when I was hiking a couple weeks ago.', 'Intact. Laying in the woods.', 'I had hiked off the trail and down by a river, and there, on a bed of moss, next to the river, was a whole, entire spine and rib cage of a deer that was – that had sat on its side –', 'None of the bones had even like – for a moment I panicked that it was a human spine, because it wasn’t – there was no head, there was no legs, and it was – I was like, it’s decomposing! It was perfectly decomposed leaving just the bones – it was gorgeous. But it’s really hard, um, to teach – you know, I’m talking right now, I’m trying to talk about relative vertebral positions but what I would have liked to do after I brought this skeleton home would be to show you how I can get an S-shaped curve but how that S-shaped curve would not imply that the vertebrae were doing any particular thing. That it’s very easy to get a range of S-shaped curves and, I imagine, a range of J-shaped curves that would allow the vertebrae to be doing something different. Meaning that you can have vertebrae that are twisted, or thrusted, or flexed, but then you could do different combinations of vertebrae position and get this shape that you want. And so that in itself is of interest to me. The measures of spinal curvature. That was a really long sidebar, I mean, are we still even talking about what’s in the news?', 'I didn’t, and I – I regret it. But it was just one of those things where I didn’t know – I should have packed it out. I’m kicking myself right now. Dangit.', 'I could, but would it still be there?', 'It took me – well, you know what? I – I’ve seen – it took me –', 'It’s not. I have a picture of it. I should send you a picture of it.', 'I think I might have actually put it on the Aligned and Well Facebook page when I took a picture of it, and I took a little video of it, because at first I was like, Crime Scene! Video! And you know, and then I was like, no, wait, hold on – HOLD ON.', 'I whipped out my flexi-curve from my backpack because I am that big of a nerd.', 'And yes, there was no fat on it. The fatometer showed 0 because there was no meat.', 'It is. Well, you have to be logical about these things.', 'The cervical vertebrae: they’re a little bit, um, heavier. I just – it just took me a couple minutes before I recognized what it is, because I’ve seen deer skeletons before – of different sizes. I mean, this was a big one. Something else that I was thinking, too, well, I wasn’t thinking it but I was talking with someone else – a lot of people like to go out and kill deer for the fun of killing it, but they don’t actually pack it out.', 'Yes.', 'People here in the woods.', 'Yeah, it happens a lot. So now our forest rules are, you can kill it but you have to pack the entire thing out, you know within – you can leave the guts and stuff. But I think it was just one of those things like maybe someone had a gun and was just shooting? I don’t know, because it was big. It was big. Maybe they cut the head off? Because there was no – maybe they just took the antlers.', 'Yeah. And then left the spine there, the spine which in itself was a trophy. You know what? I think I’m probably going to have to go back out there and see if I can get it.', 'Yeah, no, I mean it wouldn’t have been – it wouldn’t be that big.', 'Well, right, you know, the spine – you know, I make a lot of construction paper models, but how awesome would it be to have actual bone? Because your spine moves underneath your skin, and you’ve got mass distribution, muscle distribution, that stacks alongside of your spine based on use. And so you are never looking at the spinal curve unless you’re actually looking at the spine. You’re looking at a whole body in front of you. So, anyway.', 'That was in the news.', 'I did, that was with the uh, flight attendants?', 'Why would I see anything made in 2015 when I can see all of the movies that came out in the ‘90s?', 'Yeah, but she –', 'Don’t they call that the suspension of belief? I mean, I think what happens is – I think suspension of belief –', 'Yeah! Suspension – well, maybe you had to suspend your belief just to enjoy the movie for a little bit.', 'There you go. You’re an editor. Maybe – like, if you’re – if it’s like dinosaurs – I bet you there’s other things going on in that movie that other people are balking at. Probably a bunch of paleontologists were like, “Oh, my gosh! That would never happen!”', 'See? I love it.', 'Yes.', 'Because Science is a person?', 'And it’s a he. He’s like –', 'He’s like, “I gotta weigh in on this one.” Wink, wink!', 'Weigh in. That’s funny. So what did Science weigh in and say?', 'No, the  New York Times  didn’t take the students, though, right?', 'I do. I have the article, I read the article.', 'Would you like me to weigh in?', 'Would you like me, Katy Bow – Katy Bowman Weighs In.', 'Katy Bowman weighs – in your heels? Just don’t run behind me in your heels.', 'It can totally be done. And those velociraptors are sized just fine. The study was actually submitted in a letter to the editor. The study was just a one-time measure. The study just brought in freshmen, sophomore, juniors, and seniors. So it didn’t actually track them, a person going through the four years. It just looked in general at, how did freshmen who theoretically would now be wearing high heels more often, because it was a requirement, like 8 hours a day, even though people wear heels, they may or may not worn them for a particular amount of time. Of course, they could have also worn heels before. That wasn’t really controlled for.', 'You had women who had been wearing the same type of shoes that they’re going to have to be wearing on the airline, they wear them in school so that they’re ready to go. So the freshmen tested at a certain level of balance and measuring different – I think they used all extrinsic muscles – which are muscles that have one attachment in the foot and one outside of the foot. Essentially, the strength of your ankles, if you will.', 'And measured them individually to find different strengths and compared those numbers to sophomores, who then, theoretically will would have been wearing those same shoes for 2 years, and then did the same measures for juniors and then the same measures for seniors.', 'No. No. So they’re just – they’re looking at when people come in, I guess the summation of findings being when freshmen come in, they’re wobbly and their muscles are a little bit weak. But when they’re sophomores and juniors, they have adapted their – the theory is they have adapted, they perform better in the shoes, these muscles are measuring better in terms of strength. But after 4 years, those adaptations are no longer apparent, that they are back to being wobbly. Or I shouldn’t say back to being, since they didn’t test the seniors at the beginning level. The theory being that after sustained, long-term use of these shoes, the benefits of them are no longer apparent. That your seniors, you know, people who have been wearing them for long bouts of a work day – and then standing around, right? So it’s a little different, perhaps, than wearing them in your office because you’re sitting down in your office quite a bit of the time, but as a flight attendant you’re certainly up a lot more and you’re walking a lot more in them. So walking in heels is different than just wearing them. That by the time they got to be seniors, or that these seniors who were measured, they might have had a particular anomaly to that group that left them all with weaker ankle muscles and less balance than the freshmen coming in. I mean, they are older. They’re four years older. Maybe. Maybe they’re not. I don’t know. Is there a particular age? It didn’t have the age in it.', 'Anyway, that all being said, this trend, though, follows kind of the – what biologically is known about how muscle behaves. Because adaptations aren’t long-term improvements, you know, something can become shorter and tighter to accommodate a new environment, but after a while, shorter and tired – tighter – can lead to discompen- discompensation of tissue, you know, where you have different tissue breakdown because your body adjusted to make the damaging loads a little bit easier on your body. But eventually, it’s called creep, right? Your tissue starts to fail, so. That’s what they were hypothesizing was happening in this particular group. Although – what was the advice at the end of the  New York Times  article?', 'No.', 'Science doesn’t want you to change your heels! Science likes the way those heels look on ya, ladies!', 'That’s right.', 'In his flat shoes.', 'Yeah.', 'Sure. Well, that’s always a point. You know, like, that could be it. But it’s also, you know, it’s  New York Times . It’s not Science, it’s not , it’s really this journalist’s selection of questions. That kind of stuff bugs me a lot less now, I’d say.', 'I’m pretty sure it’s, “Think more deeplier.” Duh.', 'I’m here to help.', 'I’m here to help. You take Science out and I’ll take Grammar Girl out and we’ll have some talks.', 'My goodness.', 'I thought I was going to have nothing to do, I was like, it’s summer, take a break, here’s 70 emails – what do you think? It’s like, augh. I think, um, I think my day is full with talking about this stuff. But you know what? We didn’t even get around to the skinny jean stuff.', 'Yeah, our next show will be about clothes, like clothes and loads, yeah?', 'and my –', 'Flexi-curve.', 'Flexa-curve with an “i.” Flexi.', 'Sci-sci-sci She blinded me with Science!', 'All right, well, thanks for hanging out with me, Dani.', 'And thanks you guys for listening.

Well, I loved it all. I read it a couple times. The things I liked the most about what Ben put out there was how he simplified the process of getting better, of living a healthy life. You know, he didn’t make it complicated. It was very simple: just walk. You know, how he said it doesn’t cost anything, you don’t need equipment, you don’t need gear, you don’t need courses, I loved that. I mean, that could be a tagline for life. And then, how frank he was in his post – just – he didn’t pretty it up. He was just very matter of fact, just: this is what I did, this is how I felt, and I liked that, because I myself am a bit of a frank-talker. I also liked how his use of podcasts added this whole new dimension to his movement, how it made him feel more creative than ever before. That’s just – that’s so cool. What about you, what did you like?', 'I love that part.', 'The community part is so great, because everybody has their head down, and just by going out and walking around he learned to – he saw new things and learned about this place where he’d been living and I just – that’s – that’s priceless stuff.', 'Exactly. When you drive down a street, you just see the front of a house, but when you walk down you see alleyways, and how people are living in their back yards, and it is cool. You learn about streets you never knew about and pathways that you couldn’t get to by car, and I’m glad that he appreciates that so much.', 'that’s true, yeah. I mean, he didn’t just tell the guy sitting next to him at lunch; he shared it with all of us.', 'Ben’s awesome.', 'Ben is cool. And you didn’t read this because you’re just awesome, and you’re not a horn tooter, but in his thank you, he’s got this huge list of thank-yous. And at the very end of this list of gratitude, he says, “lastly, a huge shout-out to Biomechanist Katy Bowman, whose articulation of – is it – mechanobiology on Joe Rogan’s podcast was the Eureka! moment this past January that kicked my ass into gear. So you were on Joe Rogan’s podcast – it was a 3-hour – (Katy laughs) it was just phenomenal that you did that. It was a 3 hour podcast with Joe Rogan, and you can watch it, too, which is great – you can just listen or watch – and that’s what he said is his Eureka moment. And I have actually arranged for Ben to just join us briefly on this podcast', 'I know – it’s exciting – one, Ben will be our very first guest that we’ve had. We’ve been doing this a year, and so he marks the beginning of our second year as our very first guest ever, and then we can just ask him, you know, either some things that weren’t all explained in his missive online, or just ask him whatever you want to know. So. Ben, are you there?', 'Hi', 'Thank you so much for coming and talking with us', 'I just have this big old smile on my face; because there’s no way to get around it, it makes a big smile.', 'Very inspiring. The Joe Rogan podcast, let’s talk about that for a second. Were you a regular listener already to his stuff?', 'So is that how you find your podcasts, is just kind of - ?', 'I like this podcast conversation. I want to know, Katy, what are your five favorite podcasts?', 'I did not! I know!', 'I’ve heard of it, I just haven’t gone there.', 'For me? I love the Moth as well, that’s just - stories are my favorite thing ever. I love stories; And of course, RadioLab and one called Grammar Girl, because I’m a big word nerd and you can just learn so much in that 5 minutes that you spend with grammar girl. But there’s one that I think is not very well known but I love and Ben, I think you might have mentioned that somewhere but it was Invisibilia – did you listen to all of those?', 'They did, yeah', 'Exactly.', 'Invisibilia is about the science of things we can’t see, so they talk about psychological things, it’s very well done. I’m not sure if it’s produced by RadioLab or This American Life, if it’s an offshoot of that but the production value is awesome. It’s just great – you learn so much. Great stories.', 'Invisibilia. I mean, there’s so many podcasts out there and it’s something we can all share as well. We’ll talk about it at the end of the show. I have a couple questions for Ben – can we ask you a couple of quick questions before you have to go?', 'Ok. Katy, may I go first, because I gotta know this.', 'Ok, so the Joe Rogan show, so you said that was a Eureka moment. Do you remember exactly what you heard during that podcast that just made you slap your forehead and go, oh, yeah!', 'Okay. That’s what it does for me, too. That was my eureka movement, listening to her. And then you also mentioned an app that you use to kind of up your walking game What is that app called?', 'Awesome, thank you for sharing that. We’ll put that in the show notes, too. I don’t want to take up all the time – Katy?', 'Awwww', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'Well, it is your transformation and you can call it whatever you want. The fact that you shared it, I think, gives it even more power; not just for you but for so many people who just don’t know where to start or what to do. “I’m too old, I can’t.” Your generosity in putting that out there means a lot. I want to thank you for sharing that on Facebook and for calling out to Katy so that we knew about you, and for coming and talking to us and being our first guest ever!', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Take care and keep us posted, okay?', 'Take care.', 'So Ben’s awesome', 'I guess I have to thank you, inadvertently, for talking and changing his life.', 'You’re good at it!', 'Yeah, but how crazy is that to get a post like that? That’s something – because you’re not just touching that one life by him doing that and being so generous. It’s a whole lot of people that maybe might look at getting well or feeling better differently now. And that’s maybe that’s something we should wrap up this podcast with because we’re almost at time -- is that those simple behavior changes – all he did was take off walking, right?', 'Mm-hmm. I’m so glad we got to talk with him today.'], 'KATY': ['You don’t know?', 'I don’t know-oh either. It’s n-o-o-t-r-o-p-i-c-s so clearly what I need to do is go learn…', 'well, he lives in Canada, is there a tropical Canada? Anyway, so he’s learned these other things of which we’re going to have to do research when we’re done, and maybe we can ask Ben and find out about what that means. The pursuit of health becomes the pursuit of learning – oh my gosh, I love this! I’m going to say it again. The pursuit of health becomes the pursuit of learning, and that’s been one of the coolest unforeseen outcomes I’ve experienced: an awesome barrage of information and knowledge that improves you as a human being. Health gives you energy – I never lacked energy – this is - this is critical – I never lacked energy when I was out of shape, and when I unhealthy, I wasn’t sick or apathetic or unhappy. But now that I am in shape, I have what feels like an inexhaustible gas tank.', 'I know! And it’s, it’s one of things, like, if your whole - it’s all relative. How you feel is all relative, so if at your best, compared to at your sickest – so if you understand – I don’t know if you’ve had flu. I’m at my lowest, I’ve been vomiting, I’ve been terrible, but today I’m at work. I feel pretty good today I have a headache or whatever. Compared to then this new experience - if you’ve never really experienced being someone who has walked everywhere and moved everywhere and felt really good, then you’ve kind of pushed the bar on what good feels like. But an “inexhaustible gas tank.” Who doesn’t want one of those, right? And when you have the juice to do more  – you do more –  and therefore get so much more out of life. So getting fit gave me more happiness. Anyway, I just wanted to share my story because we’re all capable, when we’re ready and willing, to break bad habits and improve ourselves. It’s never too late, never too old – you’ve just got to voluntarily arrive at a place in your life where you want to make a change, and your willpower will carry you through the rest. If anything, just start with a few steps. They may cumu – I always have a hard time with this word', 'cu-mu-la-tive-ly cumul-. Say it for me real fast?', 'Cumulatively', 'Add up – I’m going to paraphrase here – They’ll add up into carrying you to unimaginable places, like my initial steps did. \\xa0 (Dani and KATY: gasps, sighs of awe)', 'Beennnnn!', 'Now, ok, we should tell the non-30,000 people who read this post – there’s more to his post.', 'He goes on to list a bunch of people that assisted him in this transformation. \\xa0 Dani – a lot of gratitude. A lot of gratitude in this post. It’s very cool. \\xa0 KATY: A lot of gratitude. But also, the picture. The picture! There’s a picture – so we’re going to give you information on where you can look to see the picture, right?', 'Great. Well, what did you love most about his post?', 'Oh my gosh, well. You know I’m big on whole body, this idea of whole body. But I feel like his post expanded on it not being just a whole body transformation – it was a whole  life  transformation. We’re like, do these exercises so you can be a better walker and walking is just part of a whole body system - - he changed his habitat, he changed so many things, but he really I think just started with a conscious change of a single thing which then snowballed. So I like that, where taking a few steps ended up impacting these other areas that you wouldn’t necessarily associate with walking, like creativity and connection to the community.', 'Yes!', 'I don’t think you can really know an area until you walk through it. I lived in an area for 7 or 8 years, driving, and it’s only when I became almost an exclusive walker that I was like, I never knew these businesses were here! You know, it’s so easy to drive from big box to big box to big box, but walking on these side streets you just realize – wow! – what people are capable of – it’s not just that there’s stores here that I didn’t know, but there are talents in my town, that I could possibly be associating with that I didn’t even know. People whose gardens and art is all around you when you stop to see it.', 'and he just teased it out, he saw it in his ability to articulate it. Just that, and I liked his use of technology. I read someone’s quote they’d put somewhere – it wasn’t like a widespread quote - it was just some guy, said, your use of technology should facilitate your human-ness, not remove you from it. And so he took a screen device, you know, there’s so much ‘get off the screen,’ which, I like that, but he used a screen to help restore some of his function. It didn’t take from that, it only added, and I like that use of technology, and I was very inspired. I’ve been on this, how can I keep teaching about natural habitats and movement through these mediums of technology? Well, this is how – this is how you can. This person got better for technology. I love that, and his gratitude, and then his use of technology to express gratitude.', 'He did, and there’s a lot of people out there who have Bens – Ben – Ben! – they have Ben in their minds – and they use themselves as a tool for inspiration. You know, Ben’s a technology. He became a technology of inspiration.', 'Ben is rad.', 'yay!', 'Hi, Ben', 'I like your comment about being free content, because you come from the music world, right?', 'yeah, I’d never really thought about it before, it was just – I started podcasting, I asked Dani to do a podcast with me because blogging was making me sit and look at a screen more, where podcasting has a little more freedom but yes! that’s what you’re doing, you’re putting it out there and people can download it and own it forever. These – your ideas and your, like you said, I’m taking my education and experience and putting it in – I – it just made me appreciate what I do more, you know, because you get, I’m producing so much of this – I wish I could actually - I don’t think of the podcast of a product when I’m done. We just do it and publish it and then I’m on to making dinner, you know, or whatever else needs I have to do for the day. But I listen to other podcasts all the time as ways to fulfill my desire for information, so I just wanted to say thank you to all the people out there who make podcasts. Ben, what are your, like if you could list out 4 or 5 of your favorite podcasts, what are they?', 'Is there a This Canadian Life?', 'I don’t’ even know if I listen to five. I, too, am a fan of This American Life, and I would say that my favorite This American Life episode is when they did one on Canadians and how they see themselves relative to the rest of the world. If you haven’t listened to that one, all my Canadian friends, listen to that one, it’s good. Serial – Serial was the big one - did you get on the Serial wave, Dani?', 'Really? Oh, well it’s there.', 'Ok, well, you can just go there much faster than everyone else who had to wait; now you can just binge Serial listening. Ok, for using actual podcast in the way that people use this podcast, Modern Farmgirls, because we moved into a rural area and bought a farmhouse and there’s just all these things that I don’t know anything about like composting and gardening and animal husbandry and I’ve just found that instead of doing what I used to do which would have been going to the library, or ordering a book on poultry, now I can listen to it while I’m walking and I can just listen and laugh a lot and hear these people’s stories. There’s one thing about listening to an actual expert trying to describe something technical, but what I like about RadioLab and the Moth, which I also love a lot, is just the ability to make a story out of it. They make learning enjoyable, like you’re just sitting down with friends and explaining something to you while you’re getting something else done. I love that. What about you?', 'What is, what is that?', 'Awesome.', 'Do it.', 'Well, I just had - the one part that resonated with me – well a lot of parts did – but I thought was interesting and I think that a lot of people out there, it either did resonate or will resonate with them, is this idea that – I mean, you’re young. How old are you, if you don’t mind my asking?', 'Ok, so you’re young, but yet you had already “resigned to the fact that fitness was in your past and your present was resigned to work and stress and obligations” and what I’m most interested in would be, do you have, like, a range in your life, it doesn’t have to be the day that you’re, “I’m going to work, and I’m now I’m someone who has a job” -- is it just coinciding with, “I’m someone who has to work, I’m not a youth, I’m not someone who has free time, I’m a worker bee, and that doesn’t lend itself to movement.” If you can recollect that phase of your life when you moved into not being a mover, but then also: why 2015? What was the moment where you were like, and “now I am no longer resigned to being someone who is always at work and always at stress and always under this load of constant obligations?” Do you have any insight into that?', 'So it’s literally changing your environment that led you to change your environment.', 'So would you say, as someone who was extremely busy, who had a lot of work tasks, did you become any less successful at your job by carving out more of your life for movement?', 'Wow, I love it.', 'Yeah. Thank you Ben, so much. Thanks for the initial Tweet and for sharing so openly. It’s great.', 'Of course!', 'Bye, Ben!', 'Yeah, that was. Wow.', 'That’ll be the first time ever!', 'Do you know how many times I’ve been told to be quiet in my life? So many times.', 'Yeah, and I think he hit on really a couple of key points. I think many people still are approaching what we talk about in the same way that he initially thought of as, “I’m a very busy, successful person. I’m successful, whether it’s at work or parenting or volunteering.” Whatever it’s your do that you devote a lot of a bulk or your time to, whatever you’re seeing as defines you. Whatever that is. People don’t want to pull time away from that because it’s logical to assume that if you’re going to be doing it less you’d become less successful. But I think why I asked Ben that question specifically is because I myself have found the opposite to be true. The amount of time I spend working is full of dead space: where I’m dead creatively; where I’m dead mentally; where I’m take a long time to accomplish a thing because my mind is sluggish. I end up working better when my movement time is greater than my – it doesn’t have to be greater than my work time but it has to be greater than it was before. Instead of trying to go, I don’t have enough time to exercise – you’re not adding exercise time. You don’t have to do anything with your exercise time. He took the time that he was normally riding the subway to work and just walked to work. He figured out a way to replace lying on the couch with a pizza watching Game of Thrones -- \\xa0 Dani – which is not such a bad plan occasionally -- \\xa0 KATY: Yeah, there’s nothing wrong with a pizza and a couch and Game of Thrones, which, I didn’t even know what the Game of Thrones was. I hate to even put that out there. You know, you were a part of that conversation. We need rest, but at the same time it’s hard to parse the sensations coming from your body. Is it that I need to rest or am I sluggish because I haven’t moved at all? Sloth breeds more sloth and it’s easy to get into the cycle of, “oh, I just need to keep sitting here! I just need to keep sitting here and I don’t feel good so I’ll rest,” but sometimes getting up and moving through you’ll get more energy side from expending energy.

Some little note that I thought would be shared by or read by friends and family is traveling around the world and inspiring people. \\xa0 Katy – it’s great', 'Yeah, I would say I started getting into podcasting maybe last summer. I’d always been an avid reader of books and a big fan of documentaries and I started listening to podcasts last year, and I pretty much started just going onto the ITunes store and seeing what the kind of highest ranked were and his were up there and I tried a few out. I became a fan of his conversational style, and range of guests that he had – from comedians to people in the science world. And I just started listening every week and, was on public transit. I think January of 2014; very early probably the first two weeks of the year is when I heard Katy on the show. That’s when she did it, too, was in January.', 'Yeah, I think, like, when I first started I would just kind of go through search tools, on iTunes, but now I talk to people who know I’m a fan and they’ll suggest podcasts and then obviously there’s a search field where you can type subjects or people’s names. So if there’s a philosopher or theme that interests you, it’ll either find episodes or shows that’s based on that, so what I like is to explore – I can hop around – uh, you know, podcasts don’t cost anything, so if you don’t like anything you can delete it.', 'I come from – I work, yeah, I’m a busy person – I work as a creative director for an agency in Toronto and I work in the music world there’s obviously been a paradigm shift with piracy and free videos on YouTube and whatnot, and I think once you get into podcasting, I mean there’s weeks where there’s 24 hours in a week and I consume 24 hours of content, and when I think about the breadth of content out there and the depth in which people discuss topics, like Katy yourself, having gone to school, your learning gets distilled into hourly podcast and I get to benefit from that from you. It’s really incredibly powerful to think about when you think about all the information people are putting out into the world, so I’m a fan of podcasting and am in turn supporting podcasters that are making fantastic content.', 'Oh, gosh, it’s kind of hard to be held to that. Coming from a music background, there’s a podcast out of California called A Hundred Words or Less, which profiles people from the punk community telling really interesting stories. I think The Moth is an incredible podcast, which is live storytellers that are unedited – storytellers from all walks of life telling funny stories, sad stories, from all walks of life. It’s the one program I listen to where you can laugh and cry all within the span of an hour. RadioLab is one – I don’t have a strong background in mathematics or science. RadioLab is a phenomenal show that presents scientific stories in a real, like, palatable, entertaining, quirky kind of way. Last but not least I think This American Life is a real beacon of podcasting in terms of the story telling and the editing. They’ve been doing it for a long time and they do it in a master way, essentially profiling different, eccentric kind of American stories.', 'There might be, but I feel like growing up in Canada we’ve always been in the shadow of everyone else, forced to consume so much Canadian content that I use podcasts as a way to listen in on different conversations in other countries.

It was just the common sense of Katy’s articulation of the need for moving. And when I thought about it after the fact, in an evolutionary sense of humans being hunter gatherers and looking at my own lifestyle at that specific moment, how I was always either sitting at a desk or on the couch, it ended up illuminating being how unnatural modern lifestyles are in terms of how they lack movement.', 'I use an app called RunKeeper, which I think once again I found online; I did try the Nike app but didn’t find too intuitive. RunKeeper is just a simple app, you almost use it in a manual way – for your walk you hit the equivalent of a ‘Start’ and when you end your walk you hit the equivalent of a ‘Stop’ and it tracks the length of your walk using some sort of map technology and can calculate calories burnt in relation to pace, distance, obviously the information specific things about your body like your height and weight.', 'I’m 33.', 'Totally. I think my natural curiosity is kind of a double-edged sword. It’s what keeps me inspired in life. It’s led me to take on a lot of professional commitments, so I work quite a busy job as a marketing director at an agency in Canada and I run a record label and a publish a little quarterly and I take photos, so having all these different tasks cobbled onto me meant that I was working a lot of hours and was stuck at a desk or whatnot. So in 2014 I was brought back to Toronto to start a new agency and what I found really inspiring was that when I worked with millenials who I feel get a bad rap online, what I thought was incredibly fascinating about my young colleagues was how health-oriented they were. People work at computers and stand up, use weird ergonomic mouses, their commitment to being really wholesome in what they consumed. We’d go to work events and they’d be like, oh, sorry, I’m only going to have 2 drinks because I have to go home and get some rest. And that was so amazing – it made me kind of feel old, like, everyone existentially has this moment where you feel like, your young generation bumped one over and now there’s a young generation. So moving to this new town and being surrounded by new, younger colleagues definitely inspired me. There was just a bunch of different inputs that overlapped and inspired me to start moving. Working with colleagues who were running to seem as millenials, standing up and typing. Podcasts. You just get to a point once you arrive at wanting to get healthy where there’s no more excuses left. There’s sensible forces driving you, and at that point when you have the will it’ll carry you through.', 'Yeah, I had been living in Montreal for 7 years and I don’t want to badmouth Montreal because it’s a culturally beautiful place but it’s a total indulgent town where it feels like you’re in the 16 th  century; a lot of red wine at dinner and a lot of rich foods. I love that  joie de vivre , I love that love of life but moving to Toronto was being around more healthy people and I never thought that environmental factors could have such an effect. I mean, I thought that I’d be unhappy if I was in jail in Siberia, but moving between two domestic cities wouldn’t change that much, but I was actually surprised at how much environment - especially so many new people and information around me, kind of through osmosis really greatly affected my lifestyle.', 'You know what’s funny? I would say that my apprehension in getting fit was always like, I don’t have the time, this is going to take away from the hours that I can put to my job, but I find that the time that I put into moving gave me unexpected forces that made me smarter, more responsive, and have a longer gas tank. I think there’s so many mixed messages in society trying to keep you in stasis, trying to keep you consuming bad foods, and if you can break free of that and find health and wellness, it’ll unlock you in unimaginable ways and make you more successful and happier. I know that sounds very New Age, but I can’t reiterate enough to your listeners – 5 months ago I was laying on my couch with a large pizza on my chest watching Game of Thrones, sore to the touch.

I worked in a vineyard as an apprentice and I got to stomp the grapes in the tub, just like Lucy. But you've got to pick the grapes first, and so this is weeks of squatting in these vineyards with clippers, clipping grapes and throwing them into a bucket. So after about 4 days of this – I think I was in my early 20s – after about 4 days of this - and I was just wearing Levi’s, not tight jeans because I wasn’t a tight jeans kind of girl. I guess they were tight enough – 4 days - I get up, and I’m walking across the farm at lunch and I just fall on my face. My feet don’t work. I had the same injury as this woman.\", \"It was in France in the early 90s, and I go to the hospital because it’s an awesome medical system and the doctor looks at me and pokes a pin in my feet and stuff. My hip flexors worked, so I could still walk but I had to throw my legs up like a duck, like a marionette to walk – and she goes, “oh yeah,” and this is all in French, so I hope I have this accurately – “oh, yeah, this happens often. We call it  les jambs de vendages  or ‘grape pickers legs.'” She says, “quit picking grapes, quit doing that, here’s a cane.” They gave me a cane with which to walk – which, you know when you’re in your 20s and working in France, trying to pick up on guys, nothing is hotter. Nothing is hotter than walking on cobblestones, throwing your feet out like a duck in your purple leather jacket. I mean -\", 'It never would have gotten that far – you should have seen me. But yeah, I could not for several weeks, I didn’t have full nerve feeling and control of my lower legs, and that was it. You know what they gave me?

What’s happening, because the  garment  could, if that garment is the problem, then everyone wearing it would be likely to experience the same issues. So could there be something else happening? A relationship? An interface - between the garment and the garment wearer - that is the problem? Because we don’t want to make the mistake of thinking the skinny jean is the issue, because then if you can find people who don’t have the issue it’s very easy to say the skinny jean is not the issue.

I mean, I thought it was really interesting –', 'What is a skinny jean? What is a skinny jean? I mean, if you think of a skinny jean as a particular cut of jean, that could be what you think of as a skinny jean. But as far as, let’s say someone has a pair of skinny jeans on – what – I was trying to quantify a skinny jean.', 'Well, but do skinny jeans have to be tight? That was my question – that’s my big question.', 'If “skinny jean” is nothing but a particular cut, meaning very narrow in the legs, all the way down, and you are someone who has very narrow legs all the way down, then “skinny jean” might mean something different to you than a skinny jean where everything is particularly narrow – like, there’s no bagginess to it at all. But your body is slightly larger at rest, out of the pants, than it would be in the pants, right? So in the blog post I’m trying to tease out a little bit that what I mean by “skinny jean” and that what this woman was experiencing had much more to do with the  pressures created by the garment  – not by the shape of the garment itself – because if the shape of the garment is real similar to your shape, then the pressure is going to be less. If the shape of the garment is real different than your resting shape, and that means, like, you in your birthday suit –', '– Then the pressures are going to be higher. So I’m always more concerned with the forces, and the forces in this case are: What is the pressure created by wearing the garment?', 'Well, again, pressure is not just by the shape of your clothes, so if I take a pair of skinny jeans and I put them right next to a pair of yoga pants and they both have the same cut – so now I’m talking about  cut , the geometry or shape of the fabrics at rest. So if I were to make a pair of stretch pants using the same pattern that was used to make a pair of skinny jeans, then you could compare those two pairs of pants – they could have the same cut. But the experience of the wearer would not be the same because the material - the give of the material - would be different. Now we have a new variable. I think I only own one pair of regular pants, which are jeans, and they’re stretchy jeans. Everything else that I own from top to bottom - from socks to pants to underwear, bras to shoes and sweaters, shirts and sweaters and jackets - they all give. I don’t have any clothing in my closet, give or take one or two pieces that I can’t think of because I never wear them, that don’t have give – meaning that, if I bend, they don’t bend with me. And as for sizing, I don’t wear any clothes that are not my same shape. So since I have a – I have an unusual – I have an hourglass shape, so that’s pretty unusual as far as clothing goes. Because I have this limitation on myself because I don’t want any clothing that doesn’t allow me to move, I’m stuck with exercise wear for the most part.', 'Well, that’s true, and luckily there are a lot of really cool - as this movement towards more natural or organic fibers and using cottons grows - they’re creating clothing that has a lot more stretch or give. So a lot of people that will wear clothing to mask their shape – they’re trying to use clothing to re-shape – fashion –', 'They’re using fashion to re-shape your shape to some preferred ideal based on the cut, right? So how it looks to the eye – when you’re looking at something and you go, “oh, make sure you have a jacket that tapers here, or make sure you have pants that have darts here,” – those geometrical features are trying to create a net appearance of a certain way. And then you have clothing that physically alters your shape, right? So those garments – gosh, there was a really cool photography blog post where he – the photographer – had taken pictures of women after getting out of their clothing all day. So they had worn their clothes all day, and they came to him, and they’d take off their garment, and it wasn’t a full body shot – it was about him capturing with his camera the indentations -', '- of the clothing on the skin -', 'It’s somewhere on the Facebook page, because it was so great – you know, you think of Spanx. Clearly, if you’re wearing Spanx or a corset you’re physically trying to alter your shape. You got that. But maybe why you choose jeans over stretch pants is because you’re also trying to alter your shape; you want something that’s going to hold things in a little bit or that creates a smoothness. If you don’t have that smoothness or that shape without those clothes, something is pushing on something else and these photographs were such a really good, like, wow! I didn’t realize that my socks were indenting! Or that the seams on my underwear were all day pressing into my skin! If you – I take of f my wedding rings at night because I can see my hands are becoming deformed to my jewelry – it’s shunting things around and affecting the flow within those areas. That was a really beautiful depiction, photo depiction. I can say and say and say all these things but until you look at a photo of these women who took off their everyday clothes that they wear all day long - and this is you pushing your bodies into fitting into your clothes! And then he had the evidence of it every single day. I thought that was interesting.', 'On ourselves!', 'Clothes that are tight -', '- so anything that doesn’t fit well, so there’s the effects of pushing on your skin, which then pushes the stuff under your skin around. This is everything deep to your skin, so everything that is inside your skin sack. But then, say you put on a pair of jeans and you have to [gasps] suck in your stomach to get them to fit: that’s another pressure change that isn’t as simple as pressing on blood vessels – you’re actually pressing on a big chamber of air and moving that around. I’m covering that in the diastasis recti book that comes out: core strength in general, how we displace our air filled chambers because it’s invisible but can create other forces elsewhere. You’ll suck your stomach in to get your waist narrow enough to fit in your jeans, but what happened to all that stuff that was in there? It was moved out of the ring of the jeans and if the front panel of your jeans is also tight, all that had to be displaced upward. That then pushes up into your diaphragm, which then pushes upward into the thoracic cavity where your heart and lungs are. So there’s different ways – it’s not just compression in the sense of fluid compression, trying to keep a volume smaller so that the fluid can’t flow into it, but sometimes fluid in this case is air, and pressure chamber distortion. Don’t know if that’s the way to say it.', 'The stuff that’s on the front of your stomach, if you can get it to go away for a picture, where did it go? You don’t have any extra space, what you do have is malleable walls so you’re able to move things away by changing the lengths of walls elsewhere. Then we have all these pressure related issues like hernias and diastasis and, well, pelvic floor issues and breathing problems – all of those functions. Your body functions really well on effective pressures, and so when you start playing with your pressures for the sake of vanity, then you start – your vanity starts encroaching on your biology a little bit.', 'You want to Tweet that?', 'Well, the tubes that live in your pants are important, but I think what was really the cool takeaway that I think one of our colleagues pointed out – Movement Revolution - I think it was Petra of Movement Revolution. She found it interesting that the recommendation was, “Don’t Squat in your skinny jeans.” Not  don’t wear them , but don’t squat in them. Again, this is one of those things where our behavior: our physical behavior, our movement behavior, is altered to perform some sort of other acceptable societal behavior like wearing nice clothing or the clothing of the time, and those subtle “Move Less” messages are everywhere. Not  don’t wear the pants  – just don’t move in them. And I find that very interesting.', 'Yeah', 'Well, that’s a logical leap – tight clothes are bad, so let’s go to baggy clothes. But it all depends on the variables that you’re assessing – what’s your model? If you want to avoid compression issues, then yes, baggy clothes would certainly be helpful. However, if you’re talking about natural movement as a whole, baggy clothes can be problematic on their own. If you’re just trying to figure out what to wear to the office and you don’t want to wear something tight, can you wear something flexible and has more give? Fine. But I’ve noticed with my children – I have a story about my son, when he was learning to climb. When he was like one and a half or two, he could climb up on – you know you go to the playground that has those things that have springs on the bottom, and they’re always like sea horses, and they rock back and forth. Well, he could barely - just by a body segment length - he could get his foot up on the loop and he could reach up and hold the handle, and he could pull. He had to strengthen his arm, and his leg, and the mobility in his hips to lift his leg up to the other side so he could climb on this – and when you have kids, you’re constantly just watching – for milestones, and you note, “He can do that now,” or, “She can do that now.” And then a week later we went to the same park and he couldn’t do it, and he was very frustrated, and I was like, he could just do that last week! I just made a Dianne Fossey note about my little gorilla: he can’t do that anymore – that’s strange! And then it just took me maybe 5 minutes before I realized that his father had put him in jeans! A baggy jean, not a tight jean, but a baggy jean – but the baggy jean had a certain length of the crotch and it still affected his hip range of motion. So here you have this pattern recognition machine that’s going out and trying to gather what it can and can’t do, whose data set – whose input – to a certain motion was like, ‘oh, I can’t do that because of the clothing,’ - the clothing itself was a cast. At that point, I was like, “yoga pants for everyone! Including the children,” because when he had something looser on - or baggy - that posed its own problems because the bagginess would get caught – it’s like, your clothing is an extension of your flesh wall. What do you want it for? You want protection from temperature, perhaps for modesty, but I think earlier on it was more about for protection. If it’s getting hooked – if you’re trying to climb trees, or balance on things, baggy clothes are a liability because they catch on things and they create forces and you can’t feel something that’s two inches behind your body. Even though you’re using it as an extension of your body, it’s really baggy body-ness that has no sensation that gets incorporated in your brain, so really, the BEST would be clothing that serves whatever your modern world needs are – temperature wise or modesty wise – without limiting your biological needs, which would be movement. So for me, that has become fitted clothing that is completely flexible, but not tight. So fitted but not tight – it matches my shape, you’re trying to just get an extension of your skin. That’s what I use my clothes for.', 'Well, my daughter really likes princess dresses but even she also loves to climb, and after the tenth time of being stuck up in a tree because her clothes or whatever – the straps on her shoes – whatever she felt like she wanted for her, you know…clothing also serves quite a bit of happiness or joy. There’s a joy in self-decoration. So without taking anything away, you have to balance all of the needs that you have in your own life. She loves those things but she self-adjusted because she valued the art of climbing trees more than the art of decoration. So once we kept pointing out, “yeah, that’s not a great tree climbing dress, is it?” She was like, “it’s getting caught!” So she really loves self-decoration so she just draws hearts and flowers and paints all over herself and she climbs naked now. \\xa0 \\xa0 KATY: So I’m still looking for where I can move to so I can do that myself, but so she found this balance of what she wanted, which was – she loves decoration.', 'I’m talking, head to toe paint. My husband was like, “I think we need to take her to a tattoo expo or something,” because he’s like, “she’s’ going to clearly come home with some sort of body art at some point.” But she doesn’t like anything to limit her extension of her shoulders and her hips, and she gets very aggravated and when she realized it was her clothing, now she wears nothing puffy. She’s like, “I don’t want anything puffy!” and so now when she does get dressed it’s all fitted, and you know, part of that is modeling, because that’s what I’m wearing as well – but her expressed rationale for those things has to do with that she’s noticed it was affecting her physical prowess.', 'you know what?

There’s no creativity here.', 'Slow fashion is my passion is the idea that the textiles in your home have the potential to be something that is much more taxing. When I say “your biology” I’m usually referring to what’s deep to your particular skin, but of course “your biology” is also the planet, the environment, the community - all those things. As far as the ecosystem is concerned, there are fashion and clothing sources that are better for you in terms of – well, maybe their chemical treatments - but also in terms of sustainability. Where they come from and then whose lives were impacted by making them, and how they were impacted – there’s just so many variables with clothing. Companies that have – that are more slow – kind of like the slow food movement -', 'Yeah, so there’s a cool NPR – did you listen to that NPR piece?', 'Do you do any slow fashion? You probably do, right?', 'The uniform!', 'Lil’ Buddy.', 'Sure', 'is it pajamas?', 'I think I started down the road when we were considering raising sheep. I mean, like I need anything else to do – I was like, “we don’t need any more warm bodies on this property!?” But sheep! And then looking at wool as how it contributed to – what’s the wool industry? I know there’s this resurgence of people who are raising their own wool and cleaning it and dying it and then knitting things from it. I grew up in California, so I was like, “what’s a sweater?” I didn’t even know until we moved to Washington and then found out that layering 7 California outfits still wasn’t going to be warm enough for Washington, and then I wanted to buy warmer clothes, but again – everything has to be super flexible, and I really like wool, but then I wanted wool that I knew where it was – what are the animal conditions of the wool? Basically, the animals are laborers – they’re growing it. What kind of working conditions, and where does it come from? I just became more concerned, really – I just like to be thoughtful. Concerned isn’t really the right tone. I like to think through about, “where is my money?” I vote with my dollars. Where is my money going? So I found that I could buy clothes from local handcrafters, you know, at farmer’s markets. Another really easy way to go slower with clothing is just to buy used clothing. Even if the clothing that you’re buying – if you’re there going, ‘there’ s no way I could afford slow clothing.’ Slow clothing, like high quality food, is more expensive because what makes it usually so inexpensive is that someone in another place is wiling to work in conditions that you would never yourself -', '- tolerate and that’s what makes it cheaper. So if you don’t have the funding -', 'No, so for instance – I buy Soft Star shoes, usually new. But other than that, almost 100% of my children’s clothes are hand me downs or second-hand clothing, as are mine in my closet. So I buy a lot of second hand stuff, which is another way of going slow – it just keeps clothing in circulation so that the efforts that went into creating that product are not in vain. Sharing – you know, we did a show on community and one really cool event that I don’t think got in the show, that I like to have a couple times a year – I like to invite all my friends over for a fun night. It usually involves some sort of cocktail -', 'Yeah, I got nothing. Nothing.', 'Thank you! Please submit all the words you’ll expect me to need rhymes for at least 7 days before recording. Thanks, Management. So take all the clothes out of your closet that you just never wear that are awesome, high-quality clothes still in great condition. You could donate them, or you could just bring them to your friends. My mom started this, where she had everyone bring on hangers – clean, not in a big garbage bag – but hung up on hangers, all pressed. She created 3 or 4 boutique stations, because my mom is good like that. She’s very much into the aesthetics and beauty of presentation, which is probably where my daughter got it from. So people laid out their jewelry and their clothing and their bags like it was for sale, like you were at a store. And everyone just swapped clothes. People walk around going, “I love this!” and tried it on, and everyone left with maybe 10 brand new things and no one bought anything.', 'And everyone cleaned out their closet, and everyone got – it satisfied so many buttons.

So here’s a question we have about torso length, and it is from Megan. Megan writes, and this is a long question, so stick with me. Megan writes, “A short torso, and big, wide ribs are the bane of my existence for more reasons than one. Working on being able to squat down, I can get down in a pretty good squat, but I feel absolutely useless once down there. I have a very short torso. The bottom of my big, straight ribs are about an inch off the top of my hip bones on the side, thus putting my knees in my armpits when I am squatted down into a comfortable, resting position. Couple that with the big boobs hanging off the front, and squatting is a very impractical way for me to do anything besides the squat itself. Is this something that increased mobility in my hips and shoulders could help with? Or is it just one of those things I will have to work around? And along with that, I have a long way, clearly, to go in work I can do in flexibility, but flexibility of the torso with twisting, etc., is the closeness of my ribs to my hips potentially an actual limitation? Or an imagined, created-by-my-life limitation?” Gee whiz, that’s a long question.', 'Ah, yes.', 'Ooh.', 'Yeah, big shift.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'That’s a great answer. That’s a big old plate o’ freedom for Megan, because she got freedom from the way of thinking about her ribs, she got more movement in her squat, I mean: Yay!', 'For me?', 'Um, actually, yeah. It’s my – it’s my legs.', 'I always thought I had short legs and I would complain, and I was a teenager, and my mom said, “Well, if you didn’t have legs, where would you be?” and I thought, “Huh.” So I really don’t – you know. There was – that was when the dislike ended. I was like, yeah, these are cool, man, they carry me around! That’s what it was for me. I don’t really have a part now just because of that.', 'It’s true, it all matters, right? It all matters.', 'Don’t be hatin’. It’s true.', 'That’s right. And Megan, yeah, go back to the Diastasis Recti podcast, and also, when can we look forward to that book?', 'Don’t want to put pressure on ya.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Cannot wait!', 'All right, let’s move on. That was a good answer.', 'Okay, here we have one from the mountain state: “Hi, Katy, this is Dani. I’m calling from Montana. I have moved twice in the past two months, and really – moving, it sucks. And I was just wondering if you’d ever consider coming out and helping me pack up my house to help me out. Thanks! Love your work.”', 'Can you imagine the gall of some people?

Not the girl in your phone, but Siri. “Hi, Katy, this is Siri from Norway. I am seeing a therapist at the moment and she is talking about what she calls hypotension. I’ve heard you and several others speaking about hypertension in muscles and fascia, which to me seems to be a very normal term. So coming to this therapist and hearing about hypotension, which she explains as a muscle lacking tension, or having given up, if you will, which can be caused by traumas both physically and emotionally, getting a muscle to get into this lack of tension. So it’s difficult for me to grasp my head around what that really is, what it looks like and does that mean that the muscle stops sending signals to the brain that it’s actually there, so you can’t feel it anymore? And how can you treat muscles or fascia in this state? So hopefully you can clarify this to me: what is hypotension? And what can you do about it? So, thank you.”', 'Yeah. And I just want to add that if the Siri in my phone had a voice as beautiful as Siri from Norway, I would be asking my phone questions all the time. All the time.

The next question is from Chris.', 'I would love that.', 'Well, there’s both sayings but different contexts. Different meanings. So, yeah. Yeah, flesh: you are correct. That was a pretty cheeky person that tried to argue with you.', 'All right, our last one! Got a few more minutes: this one is from Rhonda. Rhonda writes, “Hi. I love your podcast.

If she can’t see us, we’ll watch Captain Kangaroo.', 'Yes. Let’s do the mailbag show.', 'Oh, gosh. She fits right in.', 'Is this you? Wait, is this you?', 'Okay.', 'What was your, “hm” for? It’s like, I’ve been doing eccentric-only calf strengthening – hmmmmm.', 'Hmm. Yeah.', 'She’s straining! She’s straining, folks. Okay, so, um, I guess I’ll just translate. So it sounds like she has an issue with her Achilles tendon, so that’s – for those of you who don’t know, I think most people do, but kind of the ankle cord where your calf muscles come together to become the tendon that comes around and attaches to your heel. Very common, although a lot of people will have a tendinitis, or they’ll have maybe they’ll have general heel pain that’s been undiagnosed. So she’s doing eccentric-only calf strengthening. So let me just – I’m not going to give an example of it, because I don’t know if there’s an easy example. So I would like to see what she is actually doing that’s eccentric-only, but setting that aside, it sounds like – and she’s doing Save Your Knees, Build a Butt, which is actually – it’s actually not an Alignment Snack, it’s a webinar. It’s one of the earlier webinars.', 'It’s like an hour-long class that was – I did a, did an article for Prevention magazine, which we can link to in the show notes for – it was a – an article series that they did where they take someone with an injury and they do 3 different approaches. Like, how would you adjust her or the person’s training program to deal with what their goals were and what their limitations were? So this Build a Butt class stemmed from this article which was – and then she voted – the woman did all 3 programs for a period of time and then voted which one was the best as far as her goals and her issues were concerned. And she picked mine, so then I created a whole class out of it so everyone could do it.', 'So what the Build A Butt webinar has in it is a lot of posterior leg strengthener as a unit – a lot of single leg, like, arabesque type stuff which you can find on the blog. You can find those exercises. You can find those exercises in the article, you can find even a more fleshed-out example of these single-leg – you know, it’s like the wall, where you hold onto the wall and you reach one leg out behind you, but you’re rotating your thigh in a particular way. But what I don’t hear, from what she is doing, which seems like she’s got corrective exercises down, is how she’s changing her every day behavior. Because remember: your Achilles tendon, your whole body, but your Achilles tendon is responding to what you do all day long, so I would be interested in what – what kind of shoes is she wearing the bulk of the time? A lot of people will have professional shoes, right? The go to work, they wear heels, and then they go hit the gym or a walk or whatever, but then they swap to a flat shoe, and sometimes that rapid transition from an all-day, shortened muscle to then demanding that it lengthen while you’re doing, you know, a higher impact thing can aggravate Achilles issues.', 'She wants to know what I think about orthotics or heel lifts. I think that that could be a good idea for you, but again, I would have to know what activities you do the bulk of the day. Something else that people forget is that sitting shortens your calf muscles and puts a lot of tension on your Achilles tendon. So the calf muscle, if you start at your heel and trace up your leg, you’ve got one calf muscle that starts from the heel, goes over the ankle, goes over the knee before it attaches to the bottom of your thigh bone. So when you bend your knees, a la sitting in a chair, that muscle – that calf muscle – adapts. So even if everyone’s like, I wear flat shoes, but I still have tight calves, you might want to check the frequency with which you sit. So if she can –', 'In a chair. Well, in a chair or in any similar, um, position. And that’s actually a good kind of a side comment is – and I did write a post about this, too. You could post a link to that, also, about sitting and shortening the calves. So then, everyone’s like, what about floor sitting, and it’s not really the sitting that’s the problem, it’s that it’s the repetitious sitting. So you’ve probably sat in the exact same chair or couch or office chair or car chair, so then you adapt because you’re doing the same thing all the time. If you’re using floor sitting and you sit with your legs straight out in front of you sometimes, then it’s perfectly fine to cross them, which is knee flexion, because it’s different than how you were just sitting in a chair. Yes, it shortens your calves, but then they’re not doing this long-term structural adaptation, because you’re not going to sit cross-legged for 8 hours a day. You’re going to switch to your legs out to the side, and you’ll put your legs straight. How much does she sit, what shoes is she wearing? I think she probably would have told me if she was doing any other sort of sporting activity, but looking at that and seeing if she can change that sitting frequency and sitting position will help. If you noticed that going for a walk is aggravating your issue, then you might want to consider some sort of – you know, you can say orthotics or heel lifts, but if she’s wearing minimal shoes she might just want to go to a shoe with a small heel on it. It doesn’t have to be a medical device, right?', 'It could just be – it could just be something that gives her a little bit of plantar flexion, a little bit of toe pointing. So that would be my, um, other place to put your eyes, you know, and think about your Achilles tendon is affected by all – by all of those things. Your shoes, your sitting, and the types of movements and exercises that you’re doing. So she’s got the exercises down, so I’d look in those other two places. And then if she has more details, send them our way via the SpeakPipe feature.', 'And I’ll just end this – I’ll end this by saying, I see you, Caitlin. I see you, Dani.', 'Yeah!', 'Five bucks.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'And I added two, like with the foot book there were two – I mean, there’s a couple on the feet and then there were two other ones. A foot massage – if you haven’t done the snacks, Caitlin, or anyone, they’re a really great way to actually do a super inexpensive movement session with me.', 'And I think there’s 20 – 22, I think there’s 24 or 25. There’s 25, we just added a few more. And they’re a great intro-level. They’re fun.', '20-30 minutes. Yeah. Yeah.', 'I know. I found that I didn’t want to do anything – I don’t – hour-long classes just seem so daunting, but 20-30 minutes, I just throw one on.

You just get it right now and watch it right now. So. I love the snacks.', 'Plus, I filmed them right after I had my daughter, and so there’s a couple – there’s always outtakes in everything I do. Everything I do is mostly outtakes with a small portion being the actual, usable piece of the film. So the outtakes – I had a couple where she’s a little baby going through. Oh, I miss that little early time.', 'Aww, yeah. There was one – and I think we ended up putting it on the website, it was like, just a disclaimer: this is a mom with a 2-month-old baby, and she was very tired. The workout is awesome, but it might put you to sleep. Do not watch this while operating heavy machinery.', 'Where are you living in Color – where are you going to be moving to?', 'Do you need walking buddies in Boulder?', 'Oh, my gosh – you are going to have so many excited people that you are moving to Boulder!', 'Did you get that article I sent you about some amazing hikes there?', 'I’m going to come visit you.', 'We’ll take a big group walking.', 'I see you, Marie! That was a lovely question. I’m going all Romper Room today. So I do – I have some experience or knowledge of people using our psoas release; I think there’s a lot of different psoas release techniques. So all I know is our psoas release, which is – maybe it differs a little bit from what people would think. It’s essentially bolstering your skeleton so that you can see what the resting tension is in not just the psoas but the psoas and the iliopsoas and the rectus femoris which is one of the quadriceps that attaches the femur to the pelvis. So the whole kind of crux of the work that I do, and especially the stuff that you, Dani, have trained in, which is the Restorative Exercise™ and Alignment Markers is the idea that you can’t fix the problem until you can actually see what the problem is. So we put everyone on a grid, and in our psoas release, we put the body on a grid so that we can see the angle at which their psoas is at rest. This is a little bit different than how it looks when you’re standing, when you’re doing different things to mask it. The issue – the only issue with doing psoas – our psoas release – with someone if they were in a wheelchair would be the difficulty getting them into a supine position, which means laying out on their back. Our psoas release works – it’s not about working. It’s a measure that requires flat ground. So you can do a version of it on the bed, but the bed, when you lay on it tends to form around you. So again, when – if you have a psoas that has a resting length where your pelvis is tilted or your lumbar vertebrae are sheared, your thoracic – your rib cage is kind of moved out in front of you – when you lay flat on the ground, you see the space underneath. You’d be like, wow, my ribs are up in the air, I didn’t really realize that. Or my low back is flat, or my pelvis is in a particular position but my thigh bones are up in the air. My knees are slightly bent. A tighter, shorter psoas is one of the reasons that if you go get a massage or when you go to bed at night, people like to prop their knees or bolster their knees is because there’s a lot of tension that the resting configuration of the skeleton under the influence of a tight psoas will place on the lower back.', 'So if you can get that someone in a wheelchair down onto the floor, to be able to do it, then – depending on what sort of skill sets and movement capabilities they have – all you’re doing is you are letting your body hang out in a situation where gravity can work on the psoas. There’s nothing, really, to  do.  You’ve done the psoas release, you know, you’re not trying to move anything in a particular place. What the psoas – there’s this resting tension in the body, which would be passive resting tension, and I’m going to use an example of the kneecap release. So if you haven’t done the kneecap release, if you’re listening to this, you want to go search that on the blog or you can – Alignment Monkey, she’s got a great video of kneecap release. Everyone seems to have done a video of Restorative Exercise™ kneecap release. So you can find some example on YouTube, I’m sure. Just put in “Restorative Exercise™ Kneecap Release.” A lot of people will feel like, my quads are so tight, my kneecaps are always up, I can’t let them down. But we move their body geometry around in a way and them boop! They come down. It’s not always that easy; sometimes it takes a long time. So in that case, their kneecaps were up. There was tension in the quadriceps, but it wasn’t tension that needed to be stretched, or coaxed out. It was simply: you have to stop tensing them. But when you’ve been holding a muscle in a particular way in order to, whatever – you know, there are reasons you would hold your quadriceps tight. You’re so unaware that you’re doing it all of the time that when I say, hey, could you let your kneecaps down? You’re like, “what are you talking about? I didn’t pick my kneecaps up; they’re just like that. They can’t not be like that.” There’s this whole, mental thing where you’ve been doing it so long that you no longer recognize that you’re actively doing it. And it takes a while to find that active signal of tense that you are sending out. And the psoas is also one of those muscles. There are also passive adjustments where you can’t get a full release, necessarily, in the moment. Like there are structural adaptations to behaviors like sitting or – if you lift your chest all of the time, or tuck your pelvis or whatever else you do that changes the orientation of the attachment points of the psoas and there are 24 attachments points of the psoas major, just in case – psoas major! You know, it’s a major – it’s like a huge starfish, and you’ve got one on the right, and one on the left side of your vertebral column, and it’s got all these fingers that are touching your vertebrae, and the discs, and the femurs, and they can – it can move a lot of your parts. And a lot of people are tensing it willingly, but unconsciously. They’ve just been doing it so long. So release creates a platform in which someone who can’t relax, or what am I going to relax into? And if the bed were underneath you, you wouldn’t be able to relax, but if you get someone on the floor, they can release, and if someone’s disabilities are related to their structural orientation, then it can be beneficial. My dad’s 88 and I will get him in a psoas release. He has 2 artificial hips. It’s not easy for him to get down or get back up, but I will put him in it, and it makes his hips and it makes his SI joint and it makes his digestion better. But it’s quite labor-intensive. It’s not anything he does on his own, because it’s too much work where I go set up everything, and then I help him down, and then we just hang out while he’s down there for 20 minutes.', 'So that’s the biggest limitation, right? Is the assistance.', 'Yeah. Especially when you’re trying to – a lot of people are trying to stretch their psoas without actually recognizing that they themselves are holding it.', 'It’s like, you are both holding it and trying to stretch it at the same time. You’re freaking the muscle fibers out. They don’t – that’s like protection mode, when you are creating your own opposition even if it’s unconsciously. Release – I’m much more a fan of the release.', 'Thanks, Marie.', 'Okay.', 'That’s a long – yeah, that’s a long question about a short torso. Well, I could have written this, essentially, because I have, like, a 2-inch torso max, as opposed to my dad and my sister and my husband and my children – my dad and my sister both have that extra vertebrae so they have a long torso. I have a short torso. The big, wide ribs that she’s talking about; ribs are malleable, and so there are things – like, when your ribs are flared, which is what I’m imagining she’s referring to with her “big, wide ribs,” which, by the way, are not the bane of your existence. They are the facilitator of your existence. So just to change the internal message.', 'Your short torso and your wide ribs are the essence of your existence, so don’t think about them in the way – like, without them, you would be dead. So you’ve actually got it completely backwards. They are facilitating your existence, and they are beautiful. However; big, wide ribs are simply ribs that are not being managed properly by your core musculature.', 'Right?', 'That’s a shift in thinking, and what I would refer back to is the diastasis recti show. I think that, Megan, you can benefit from listening to the Diastasis Recti show because I believe that we talked about ribs.', 'And it’s also going to be in – and I just finished writing it – expanding on a big section of this in the Diastasis Recti book, in the core strength book coming up, because you know, your ribs are connected to your pelvis via your abdominal muscles, and when they are wide it’s an indication of – just the goings on of your torso, and it can be respiratory issues, diaphragm issues, abdominal strength issues: all of those being affected by the amount of strength that you do or do not have. So in that way, it’s an actual – what she’s asking is is it an actual limitation or is it an imaginary limitation? It’s a real limitation, however it’s a malleable limitation, which means that it is not a limitation that is going to be in front of you, impeding you for the rest of your life. It’s an indication that core strength might facilitate your squats, and now we’re back to this bigger idea that is that there’s not fixing your upper body and then getting a good squat and then getting core strength. It all goes together. Her squats will become more comfortable the more core strength she has because it’s going to position her ribs in a way where they’re not, you know, interfering. And then also, when we think of – again – so this is in  Move Your DNA –  the book where you know, you break down and talk about a squat as having this form, but the form to the squat is really to elicit a very particular response to doing the squat. Squats – in real life –are not the type of squat you do for exercise; it is a dynamic movement in a lowered position, so um, you know, I’m out picking strawberries for two hours and I’m in a squat positon the entire time, but that squat position is really just a category of 100 different positions that I assumed that we will call “squat.” So if you’re trying to squat, you know, with your feet pelvis width apart, and your knees pointing in this direction and your pelvis down and your ribs in this place, then of course your boobs are going to be right up on your thighs. It’s not very practical. But neither is just sitting there in a squat. So if you’re trying to get work done in front of you – like, I’m picking strawberries, and with my short waist and my big boobs, like, I’m moving around and I’ve got my chest rotated, right?', 'Because in a real-life squat, movement is large and rotational. So don’t feel like you have to squat in a particular position. If your knees and armpits are interfacing, and you don’t want them to be, just twist your torso and do the task that you’re trying to do in your squat off to one side, and then the other side. Or assume a different kind of squat, where – pick anything off of the “Think Outside the Chair” poster or blog post, or picture in  Move Your DNA  where there’s 30 other or maybe even more squat-like positions that don’t have this really narrow constraint that you find uncomfortable right now. So, that would be – is that a good enough answer?', 'Yeah, everyone right now, call to mind the part of your body that you like the least, and realize that without it, you would die, and that it’s awesome. Is that – what is that for you?', 'Yeah, do you have one?', 'What!', 'I love that. Just draw like a little heart. Just go give a little heart tattoo, give a little extra love to the part.', 'It’s holistic. You can’t be hatin’ – you can’t be hatin’ on yourself because that part is you!', 'Don’t be a hater.', 'Oh my gosh! So soon!', 'I know, it’s okay. It’s okay. It’ll be out the end of 2015, so right now we are in the summer? This will probably air in August of 2015, and so – you just have months. Just a few more months and we’ll probably pre-order it with some sort of – we’ll probably couple some special core strengthening Alignment Snacks with it for pre-sale.', 'So look for that, pretty soon.', 'I know, me either.', 'Thanks.', '(laughing.)', 'Some people are soooo rude!', 'You moved out of your house to the new house, only to get the job offer for the family to move to a different state.', 'Did you just make a  Running on Empty  reference?

Which I didn’t really realize until, you know, friends listening to it go, yeah, that sounds like you pretty much all of the time. Yeah, so.', 'Outtakes, people.', 'Outtakes.', 'They’re mostly coming out of my mouth.', 'And so Audible – you can get it on Audible, and you can also get it on iTunes.', 'Just download that right to your little device, and go out for a walk and listen to it. And the audiobooks – the audiobooks come with .pdfs so if you’re worried about not wanting the visuals? I think a lot of people don’t buy audiobooks for movement books – I think I’m one of the few people –', 'Yeah. Yeah, well, you get a .pdf with all of the pictures and all of the written explanations as well, so it’s kind of like you get the content on the go, so you don’t have to sit and read it. But when you’re ready to do the actual exercises, you can just sit and refer to the .pdf that’s included.', 'Thanks, Andrew. I see you. I see you, Andrew.', 'Okay. Well, there’s – so just to clarify: hypertension. Hyper is a lot, so too much tension. Hypotension is the opposite: too little tension. A more correct term for tension in this case is usually tone. So hypotonicity is also referred to as flaccid muscles. I have never – that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist – but I’ve never heard hypotension, or flaccid muscle diagnoses for things other than motor nerve issues, where there’s like a – there can be a trauma, a nerve trauma, where the muscle itself no longer responds to the signal, in which case you would have a flaccid muscle. And it’s also hard in the translation, so I imagine that sometimes, you know, like, if you’re – and she’s in Norway, I think, right? So if you’re – the Norwegian scientific terms should line up with the – you know, the English ones – but if they don’t, that might be a place where trying to reconcile what you’re reading in English here, which is different than a Norwegian journal. I’ve searched, you know, Google scholar and PubMed for flaccid muscles or um, skeletal muscle hypotonicity and I’ve only seen it associated with nerve damage. So I’m wondering if – sometimes when we speak we speak casually, she would want to clarify with her therapist that she’s not using flaccid muscles or hypotonicity in lieu of a muscle weakness, you know, a muscle that’s not contracting. So Siri would know if she’s had, you know, major muscular damage, like trauma, where there was nerve or actual tissue damage where the tissue itself is no longer responsive, or if this is just a more casual reference to, you don’t have enough tone in your muscles and we’d like you to have tone, in which case, you can improve your tone by moving more but in a very specific way, depending like if – most – most cases of muscular hypotonicity outside of some whole body, genetic condition would just be spot – you know, you have a spot, you have one muscle that’s not responding the way it should. Or a muscle group, whether you got in an accident or whatever, you know, whatever the situation might be. It’s really the same thing. It’s – I work with people often who have very low tone, and again: tone is not a super specific word, but I think of it as a resting tension where when you go – the muscle is primed, it’s ready to go and primed for movement and it’s response and capability in dealing with the loads that come on as you’re moving is able to facilitate that movement with strength and stability, you know, many muscles doing that all at once. And the way I train people in it, that’s what I use alignment for, because I don’t think a lot of people are aware of is: your muscles respond to a very particular geometry, meaning if you’re creating a motion in a particular plane, but the muscle that you want to help you while moving through that plane is located in a different plane because of – you know, I think of like a forward bend. So you have, like, hamstrings down the backs of your legs, so as you do a forward bend they’re going to let you go down, and they’re going to help you back up again. But as you turn your feet out, what you’re doing is you’re turning a portion of your hamstrings away from the plane in which they would function or contribute to that forward bend. So you can do a forward bend having less action, less activation, less performance in your hamstrings because your position is such that it has removed the leverage capability or the force generating capabilities of a muscle. So what I do, when someone has a tone problem is before I assume that they have a tissue damage, I go, well, maybe you’re just not ever lining up your planes of action with the muscle that you thought you were using. So a lot of people, when they take an exercise class or do an exercise for a specific thing, they’ll show me, oh, I’m doing this for my biceps. It’s like, well, that’s awesome, but the way that you are doing it means very little biceps can actually work. So here, this is why we adjust your form, right? So that’s the whole thing with body building or alignment or postural adjustments is that you are bringing a higher percentage of what should be working for that motion to that motion so that that motion is executed better. Betterly. I think it’s betterly. So. Hopefully that helps Siri.', 'I have no idea. Like, I – I don’t know. When they ask me?', 'Hm.', 'I’d be too embarrassed.

I told you I was feeling singy today.', 'I asked – I thought I would go right to the source and ask my BFF who is also a podiatrist her input first, and then I will comment on it otherwise, because I thought if – if you can get free advice, why not take it? So for Rhonda, here was my BFF/DPM’s answer. “If we knew all the reasons why this happens, I believe we would have “cured” the problem by now. Cured is in quotes. The big culprits are shearing forces and evaporation of the foot’s natural moisture when wearing an open shoe.” So shearing foices – I’m shearing voices! Hello! “Shearing forces are like when you put your hands together and you rub them back and forth. That motion of one part sliding past another is a shear force. The feet I treat most often are those exposed to air by wearing shoes that are open at the heel. The fat padding tends to be thicker, allowing for more movement or friction. If the fissure gets so bad that they harden or crack, then debriding away the hard skin is usually necessary.” See, this – wait, hold on, I gotta read the whole thing so you can get the full picture.', '“I typically also employ” – I gotta read this, it’s so good. “Debriding away the hard skin is usually necessary. I typically also employ topical keratolytics?” I don’t even know how to pronounce it, I don’t even recognize it. It’s kera- which is skin, -tolytics.', 'And she employs these topical whatchamacallits under occlusion and “often prescribe a more closed shoe for a period of time.” So this is someone who can actually speak normally in conversation unless she’s talking about feet, in which case a medical dictionary must be at your side the entire time. But basically what she’s saying is she’ll give a skin softener under occlusion, meaning, like, just cover your foot, right? So put something on your foot and wrap it up, so don’t expose your foot to so much air, because everyone knows that’s bad for your feet. So that’s kind of your traditional take on it, and I have – I don’t have that deep cracking, but my feet are extremely, extremely dry. If I had to pick a piece of my body that gave me the most grief, where I’m always like, ugh, god, I hate you! It is the skin on my feet, and that’s obviously not okay since I love my feet and without that foot skin I would have to cut them off, so.', 'So I am going to take my own medicine here, but I will also say that as far as skin softeners, I’ve tried everything, and I just want to give a shout out to what I’ve recently found, which has been amazing. And I have tried everything to keep my feet from being really, really dry and constantly peeling. And that’s Moon Valley Organics, have you ever heard of them?', 'Even if you do nothing else but go to their website and look at their super cute website and watch their video of how they got started – it’s amazing –', 'Moon Valley Organics. Two products: psoria-soothe and', 'Yes. Right? And the other one’s called, like, EczaCalm. So I’ve tried them both because no one really knows if it’s eczema or psoriasis on my foot, it’s just kind of like an inflammation that constantly peels. It’s worse under friction or shear forces. Also, when I travel, a plane when they swell – that’s enough stretch of the skin where it aggravates it.', 'So those two things have been awesome. I can’t remember – I think the PsoriaSoothe ended up working out better for me.', 'Everyone’s just different, but those are just – yeah – and they’re – it’s a Washington company.', 'It’s a local Washington company.

This is like – hydration comes from the inside.', 'The skin’s hydration isn’t about what you put on topically. Yes, the external environment matters, but your internal environment also matters, and I tend to be low on oil and fluid anyway. So look into maybe dietary changes; you can ask someone about, you know, how to be more hydrated and yes, that means drinking more water, but it also usually means eating more oil, right? Because –', 'A lot of good fat, you know, because you can keep putting water on your deck, but it just sucks it up. The true hydration is when you’ve sealed it, you know. So maybe that, and then also, how do you use your whole body all of the time? She’s barefoot, but what about other things like circulation down to the lower legs so that the skin’s super healthy as a whole? How much are you using your calves: if you did the calf stretch, what would that tension look like in there? So. That would be my input for that. Hopefully that was helpful because that question resonated with me. I’m like, here’s my secret thing that I just discovered!', 'I mean, I’ve had a problem for years and years and years, and the PsoriaSoothe that I put on – it was like a week and I’m texting pictures going, “no way!” I put it on before I got on an airplane and then I covered it, right, so that’s occlusion – you want to go ahead and close it off with some good socks and let it saturate, you know.', 'I do.

And that was such an a-ha moment for me. I was like, oh, you know, these are – we are so unused to these small areas of extreme circulation and robustness, right? It’s healthier, it’s stronger, it’s thicker, that we cut it off because amidst the other, weaker parts of our body it feels uncomfortable, right? So if you only have a callus that’s the size of a pencil eraser and you’re stepping on it over and over again, it becomes a place of heightened pressure, which is what makes it uncomfortable. Of course, a callus being in one small spot on your foot because of the way your shoe rubs is different than a whole foot callused because of walking over ground and outside with lots of friction. So it was just a perspective-shifting movement for me to recognize that a callus was not a medical problem that needed to be cut away: the problem was the weakness all around the callus, and that we should strive to bring our body up to this better vascularized place.

To move forward – that skin traction is the first force that allows all of the other joints and muscles to work, so. That was it for me.', 'Yeah. Well, and just, you know, when you’re all – we’re all shod, right? So it was like, what is this pea? I’m a princess, and what is this pea in my shoe? And I was like, oh, it’s a place where you have mechanically loaded more and the body’s adapted by becoming more, generating more skin to an area, and so therefore you have more vascularization because you have more tissue to keep healthy. And, anyway.', 'Yeah, it was just a reverse. It was good for me, and then I started thinking about hands, right? Hand skin, hanging, swinging – if a lot of people listening to our other shows are like, oh, I want to start hanging and swinging and tree climbing or even if you’re like, already lifting in the gym or whatever you’re doing, and you’re like, it’s my hands that give out first. It’s the hands if you go to start hanging from a monkey bar that’s usually going to fail first. It’s your hands that let go because the skin isn’t strong enough to carry the burden of your weight, because you simply haven’t done it very much. It hasn’t thickened over all resulting in the ability to use more shoulder and arm muscle because the weakness of the skin doesn’t allow you to continue to go on.', 'Yeah, right.', 'Yeah, it’s like –', 'Yeah, well, we’re not talking butt calluses, are we? Who is this person that you’ve been feeling their calluses? Is this your husband?', 'Your child?', 'Yeah, it’s dense, too, we were tapping our calluses, because if you just flick your skin, it’s just like, thud thud thud but if you flick a callus it’s tighter, so it bounces off. It’s almost like a thin, plastic shell, like a flexible – like a soft-shelled crab almost, which is kind of gross, but like that.', 'Toto’s Africa. Toto’s Africa played in callus. We need 1200 people to hit every single note.', 'Well, first we have to say that it’s younger than it actually is. It’s like, skin is somewhere between 20-29. Just so it can get a date. But anyway, well, I think the functions of skin, you know, if you just go to the Wikipedia basic functions of skin, it’s part of your immune system, right? It’s that first defense for germs. It also is a major sensory input organ. Um, so – I can push on your skin. Everyone can touch their skin right now and you can feel that, but you can also lightly – you can lightly brush the area on top of your skin where there is no skin, but you’ll be moving hair around. So your hair, then, moves the skin. So that’s the interesting thing about loads to the skin is they don’t only come via a direct exchange. The hair, if you move the hair, the hair moves the skin and that, too, is movement to the skin. So maybe that’ll come out later when we’re talking about hair. That’s why they’re so difficult to separate, because you can clearly see when you’re moving the skin directly, but it’s harder to see when you’re moving the skin because of the bending and movement of the hairs. And then there’s also the movement of the hairs that come from the muscles – the erector pili muscles that are inside your skin, so that’s moving the skin simply because the skin is, you know, essentially containing these muscles and then the hair is moving the skin and the muscle. So it gets a little muddled, but also – like, so for as far as movement: movement is my area that I work with, and so like, I’m really fascinated by things to the skin like: if your hands or your feet get wet, they get a little pruny? Right? Are you familiar with prune hands?', 'That – it’s increasing the traction of your hands.', 'So, like, you know – way! If you are, you know, you get rain tires? I mean, I guess all tires are supposed to be rain tires, but there’s tires that handle better in the rain, because they have deeper traction that’s flinging the water, right? So that’s what they figured out that pruning is for, is your skin sensing the environment and adapting in – you know, within a minute or 17 or 40, however long you’ve been in a hot tub – and that it shifts the shape so that you can still have traction even in wet situations, which I felt like – that’s huge. That’s actually a shift in shape that your skin is able to do to handle the environment. It’s a highly adaptable organ, so there’s that –', 'We are very cool.', 'We are very cool. Um, but it also changes color, right?', 'So, like it’s – there’s um, you know, and there’s so much interesting stuff out right now with sun exposure, you know, we’ve kind of gone from – we’ve kind of re-like, seriously decreased our light exposure because of being inside, and then we have, like, this short term adaptation of skin to burn and then peel off because it doesn’t take much energy to maintain more pigmentation if you’re rarely out in the light. But if you go out into the light more frequently, then you have this adaptation where your skin is going to darken a little bit and effect its relationship with the light, so you don’t have to go through the burning and peeling process, so I just think of it as this highly intelligent, highly adaptable tissue that surrounds your body that again most movements are going to pass through your hands and your feet as they have the ability to thicken and essentially increase your ability to move well through an environment. So I just find it fascinating – fascinatingly under-represented or thought about, you know?', 'Yeah.', 'I know, we are! We watch X-men and we’re like, that would be so rad! It’s like, dude, it’s rad right now! Go sit in the bath for 17 minutes!', 'You’re Mystique! We totally are! I am all the time, as long as I’m in the bath, or in the sun.', 'Yeah. So here’s where the whole thing started with me while I – I mean, I was talking about skin for  Every Woman’s Guide to Foot Pain Relief,  but hair – someone posted on Facebook (the source of all genius thoughts) was an article about Native Americans having – who were excellent trackers before they went into the Vietnam War, but then upon having to get the military cut, they lost their tracking abilities. It was like, a huge article, and you know, I read it, and I was like – I’ve always been interested in hair. I’ve always been interested in erector pili muscles, why hair is more concentrated in certain locations of the body, you know, how the effects of – like, I’m always thinking in terms of loads, so what about short hair vs. long hair? We’re in a world where you don’t have, you know, access to major cutting tools, like, how did that change the loads to everything? Because, like, you’ve got hair, but its hanging on your skin, which is hanging on your connective tissue, which is hanging on your bones. So there’s loads. There are loads to your head from having a huge head of hair.', 'Right.', 'You had dreadlocks? Like, long ones?', 'Come on, pictures in the show notes! Or at least send me one. Send me one.', 'You were having an identity crisis. You know what we should do is dreadlocks on one side and bald on the other side and we’ll do some data collection, because I – you know, your head –', 'You go a- head?  That was my one pun. So I think that hair is fascinating in that there’s clear – there’s clearly a large roles for hair, whether or not we think about them is a different matter, but it doesn’t mean that they don’t exist just because we don’t really think about them. So –', 'Okay.', 'Yeah, we can do whatever you – whatever you were thinking is fine with me.', 'Sure.', 'Sure. Well, I think natural - I mean, so we talked about this when I went to the MovNat retreat, so this is in the MovNat show. You know, I’ve written a lot of blog posts on foot skin and hand skin and how to improve the strength of your skin, right? So it mostly comes down to dynamic surfaces. If you’re wearing shoes and you have a couple calluses it’s because the way that you use your feet in those shoes, there’s only a couple points of pressure. So when you walk out on cobblestones, or even in the grass or the dirt or whatever – sand – you’re like, what you’re feeling is you’re feeling more points of pressure. The shape is different underneath your foot, and so the response is to change your shape to match. So the shape, in this case, is more layers of skin at these points of pressure. So there’s that, and then for hand skin, you know most of the work that we do is on bars that are very flat, so the points of pressure tend to be, for those of you who have been hanging or swinging or even working out and you know, using kettelbells or monkey bars, that the points of pressure tend to be at the bottoms of your fingers, you know, where most people’s calluses show up, those pads, right? They tear or rip off a callus, the worst thing ever – ever – is to rip off a callus and see it hanging there. But if you were hanging onto a tree that the tree itself would be like, if you just go find a branch when we’re done listening or if you’re listening to this outside, which is awesome. Go find a branch and just grab onto it. If you can hang, fine, if not just go grab onto it really hard for like 20 seconds and then pull your hands away, and you’ll see that the tree is indenting your hand, right?', 'Kind of like if you put the couch on the carpet how it indents the carpet?', 'But if you do that enough times, then your skin thickens so that that sensation isn’t painful. But in order to get that uniform callus that you find on tree climbers, is to do lots of different surfaces. It’s the variation of surfaces that brings about the uniformity of a callus. But when I was in the MovNat – I always thought about hands and feet, while the rest of me was clothed, you know – and never touching – never really touching the ground. I usually have my pants on when I’m out hiking –', 'I know. You, you – it’s not that I’m not a fan of the butt callus, I just don’t live in an area where it’s super kosher. But we were doing a lot of work transitioning from knee sitting, so I ended up being on my knees. But being on my knees in different variations: rolling to one side, being on one knee, just kind of scooting around and doing all this floor shifting, and by the end of 3 days I had a knee callus.', 'I was in the sand, right. So it’s different than being – going, oh, yeah, I do that, you know, at my studio –', '-- or wherever, like, that’s one level of callus in the same way that you get a certain type of callus with bars, but when you’re doing that stuff over natural terrain, it really changes the formation of the callus. So I just – there’s that: those calluses that develop in areas of repetitious loading. So anything that you would expect to be in contact with the surface more often. Hands, feet, butt, knees, would probably be thicker naturally. But then there’s all these other loads to the skin like, just, scratches, right? If you – we were just gone done doing a four-day gait workshop here, and a lot of it involved natural – natural walking. Natural meaning off of a trail, right? Because even if you’re in nature, if you’re on a trail, that trail isn’t natural. That trail is, again, it’s a man-made, repetitive-use kind of injury to the woods where you’re walking through. When you walk off, you get a lot more scratches – there’s many more loads to your skin through interacting with things that have not been removed for your ease of walking pleasure. And so those are loads to the skin. So your skin, you know, becomes stronger. I guess I’m using stronger in a maybe literal but maybe also not – it just becomes more used to – you become more used to having your skin um, scratched, and then you, you build in response to those regular loads. So there’s just – like, that’s the natural loads to the skin but then there’s also.', 'Well, it’s got to heal, right?', 'And that – I guess that brings – like, skin is lousy with – lousy meaning a lot – skin has a lot of mechanosensors because it’s a highly sophisticated sensory organ. I mean, you could tell the difference – I think this original article that I posted which was a research study was I was trying to figure out, like, skin – you can sense, like, the difference between the sizes of raindrops and whatnot. Like, you – there’s so many receptors there that your acuity –I think acuity is the best word – your acuity of sensation is very high relative to the skin. And so this brings up, for me, thinking of mechanotransduction which is how the cells are all going to alter their behavior based on loads – what is the role of sensory input in maintaining the health of the body. Not just of the skin, but of the entire body. And so then I – so then you start thinking about, there’s a lot of research on touch therapy, massage therapy. But it’s really hard to, when you’re looking at the benefits of massage, to break up what’s a benefit that’s coming simply from the touch to the skin, is there a deeper pressure that’s a benefit? Like, you’re doing it all at the same time, so as far as research goes, it’s hard to figure out exactly what the benefit is coming from. But touch itself, touch is a natural phenomenon, so that’s a natural load to the skin, not even thinking how hard or how soft but um, there’s a woman whose – I cannot think of her name, I’ll see if I can find it for the show notes – you know, being primates that grooming – like, all over grooming – this kind of all over touch is a normal load. It’s a natural load, and so what is the frequency of touch that we really require where – what is the location of touch that we require? So we think about, like, humans touch, we hold hands, like, there’s intimate touches. But over the course of the day, there’s very little touching, and then with subgroups of humans right now there’s even less touching. Like I would say right now that children get touched more than maybe adults, and that adult women, I think, there’s studies that show that – there’s a lot more, just touching – like if I’m talking to you, I’m going to be rubbing your shoulder or smacking your cheeks, kicking you in the knees.', 'No, I’m talking about human to human touch –', '- that there’s a human to human – can you hear my cat?', 'I have a new cat. I got – the cat somehow got locked in my door – hold on. Give me one second. Sorry! I think it needs to go to the bathroom, hold on. I’m letting you out, come on!', 'These are new rescue cats that we took off someone’s hands. I’m not a fan of pets, but I’m hosting them for a little while, and one just came out of the bed after 2 days and decided in the middle of a podcast that it has to go to the bathroom.', 'It’s like, what is this? Something is clearly significant and important going on.', 'Um, okay. So let me go back to – what was I talking about? I was talking about human-to-human touch where there is actual – you know, like brambles, those give you scratches. But I think of – when you’re trying to figure out the benefit of touch and you think of your body, like, a carpet that has to be vacuumed, when you vacuum a carpet you don’t leave anything ungroomed. But if you’re looking at other primates, primates groom like that, right? They are grooming - so much of your skin is being touched. I’ve always been interested in the fact that mammals, when they’re born, you know the mothers will lick the other – the babies clean so that I’m going, oh, I wonder if there’s an initial kickoff or benefit to this interaction, that it’s not only about them being, getting clean, but that it’s kind of like a vacuum stimulation between two organisms, right? There’s nothing – there’s no fake or artificial thing in between the two, so these are all the questions that I constantly hold in my head regarding skin, because it’s so – it’s so involved in the natural world. It’s significantly less involved in the modern world. And then given the newer research on just how loads to the skin and to the hair – so then now we talk about the shaving, what about someone shaving totally? How is that going to affect the loads? If I’m going to be –', 'I know, hair! Like, that’s the big thing. Hair removal is a totally modern thing and it’s coming from a place of maybe not considering that hair um, is going to move the skin. And when you remove the hair, you’re removing even more loads. Like, if you imagine – say you’re not even being touched, and you’re not walking through brambles, but a breeze comes through and blows your hair, that is a load to the skin. In addition to – I’m not even talking about a response to the temperature. I’m just talking about the bends of the hair, like blades of grass or a stalk of wheat being deformed. So you think of the hairs on your body constantly being moved back and forth because of a breeze, and you shave – that’s going to be gone. If you think of moving through the water, and all those bends and loads to the hair being gone means a decreased input to the skin. The wind is still going to blow on the skin, so there’s that. But your hair follicle was also an independent load to the skin outside of the wind blowing directly on the skin, so that’s missing. And I was just reading an article today on bats, you know, and they’ve figured out that there’s – that bat hairs – I think it’s on their flying membranes – not that you have to know that anatomy – but that the hairs are airflow indicators, and that they – so as the bat is flying, or moving through the air, they’re being bent in a particular way, then is communicating directly with the brain of the um, uh, I wanted to say mouse – bat – in the same way that we are bending our hairs and moving our hairs communicates directly with our brain. And that if you shave, man, what we do for science. If you shave those bat hairs, it can’t fly. Or it flies, it flies in an altered, poor way. So think about that, you know?', 'Yeah. It’s kind of one of those things where we don’t even know what our body does, but we’re good at eliminating large chunks of it, you know?', 'Yeah, I know. I think that, you know, again, we try to separate it. It’s all separated for the purpose of investigation but we’re already talking about, like, being inside is already affecting the loads to your whole body including your skin, including the muscles that regulate your temperature by lifting and lowering the hairs of your skin. So hair is part of your heat – believed to be part of your heat regulation process, but it’s not that it’s just there. I think that people think that I have hair, so it keeps me warm. But it’s really that – you know, about the air being trapped under the hair, and also that those hairs are moveable, that there’s muscle moving the hairs up and down to optimize your heat saving geometry. And then also, is there heat that comes from the movement of those hairs, right? The shunting of blood to the trillions of muscle that you have throughout your skin.', 'I don’t know, I don’t even know. I have no idea.', 'Yeah, there’s – it’s organs! It’s organs! And you know, humans have been, you know, messing with their body, you know, for as long as National Geographic has been out, so, and probably before. So it’s just – it’s just one of those things where, you know, we are attempting to solve lots of problems. Not you and I. But mankind, right now, is thoroughly investigating – they’re looking for solutions but I – I don’t know where – maybe it was on this podcast – where Diane Fossey is like, if you’re trying to figure out how to save – she was talking about gorillas – you have to know their baseline of behavior. You have to know what they’re supposed to be eating, how they’re supposed to be mating, what is their communal living like, you have to know all these things before you can start troubleshooting why they’re not doing so well. And we’ve kind of jumped to troubleshooting, but we really don’t spend much time investigating the actual baseline requirements, and so we talk about humans as social creatures, creatures that touch, creatures that have hair, um, creatures that eat a particular way and move a particular way. There’s all of these questions that are really part of establishing a baseline for what it is that humans need, and that’s what I’m most interested in.', 'Yeah, and also – just, I guess so our faithful listeners know, we keep talking about show notes. They are coming.', 'We’re just talking – just put it in the show notes! They’re in the cloud! What’s the cloud? We don’t even know. That’s another show. But, um, the show notes are all in the process of being transcribed, and then we will have them on our new website that will be up later this Fall 2015. So once they’re up you’ll have full transcripts of all the shows that you have listened to, links to your heart’s desire, so we – we apologize for not –', 'They’re like, in my house, just drive on over. And that’s why you keep moving! You keep moving so that no one can catch up with the show notes.', 'I’m in Colorado now! Oh, wait – I’m in New York City. No. Do not move to New York City.', 'They’re packed up.', 'No. No. Because – I mean, I just – it’s not part of my, you know, anything I do, the movements I do them fine, still, but I don’t do them on sand. Like, I’m not seeking – I’m not actively seeking knee calluses. It’s just not on my priority list, but I am actively seeking, um, hand calluses, and I think my foot calluses are good because I just got a massage, I don’t know, a couple weeks ago and she’s like, rubbing my feet, and she was like, um, she’s like, something tells me you spend a lot of time barefoot.', 'And they were clean, so I know it wasn’t the filth. So yeah, it’s just that weird kind of – should I actually tap, should I tap my callus so you can hear it?', 'I won’t. Hold on. \\xa0 (tapping sound)', 'Could you hear that?', 'Yeah. So they’re tappity tap. They’re like tap shoes.', 'Oh, my goodness. Yeah. He didn’t accidentally, like, where’d my calluses go?', 'He was in Thailand.', 'Trying to find the show notes, and he was actually at – he was at a Thai massage school, and so they – part of it was receiving a lot of massage, and so he had gotten an appointment and had had a full massage and they also do, like, they put pedicure foot health is a big deal. So he had a massage and he was kind of asleep, and she was working on his feet and he was just kind of like, ohhh, and then he got up to realize that she had cut off all of his calluses. Then he’s been – I mean, he had been walking barefoot –', '- since he was a teenager. So on – on', 'Oh, the guy sleeps. The guy totally sleeps. Yeah. I can’t even – I can’t, like the cat meows from five rooms over I’m like, what is it! Wha? He’s like, he just had his whole foot removed, he had a quarter inch of his foot removed and he just had no idea. That’s the difference between us. But yes, and so he – he couldn’t – his gait was altered. That was the biggest thing. When I was writing  Whole Body Barefoot  was when he was telling me that story and he said it was – I mean, it was crazy because he had had calluses – this callus had been growing since he was like 16. So adaptation – adaptation is the addition or removal of body parts. So, like, if you have a callus it’s because you have added more parts to your foot. Those parts, while he just lay down over 45 minutes were removed. So his whole gait pattern depends on those, the whole way he carries his weight depends on the sensation of the weight, and the calluses were part of his gait, and they were instantly removed, and it was like, he was hobbling because now the bones were pressing this brand new, soft part into the ground and it was like all of a sudden walking over glass. It would be like the equivalent of someone being shod to unshod. He went from callused to being uncallused, and it took him over a year to get back to walking where he was walking before.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'I don’t know is the easiest answer. It might have something to do with load, meaning, like, you’re weight bearing. You know, it’s not just about pressure. It’s about the amount of pressure. So, like, if you take your hand, if you look where the calluses form – you look where the calluses form right there at the base – you can just push on it all day, that’s different than hanging your full body weight from it. So if something underneath your foot, underneath your full weight is different, you know, than lightly squeezing a little bit. So that it probably has less to do with just the fact that the load isn’t enough to warrant – like, your body’s always making an energetic cost, right? If it didn’t have to grow and support more tissue on the foot, it would opt to do that. But there’s a certain point in which coping with the load is easier just by adding more mass. It’s energetically less expensive to grow and maintain the mass and whatever else it has to do with the discomfort. So I imagine with socks it’s just not – the tradeoff isn’t there.', 'Yep!', 'Well, we should definitely do another talk on – I mean, we could talk more about hair as best as we could, but it’s just kind of the same thing, I mean, the answer to most questions are, I don’t know. You know? And it depends, but as far as – I think it’s just to open the discussion – it’s to open the wonder. It’s to open the wonder in our own minds! You know, it’s just – we’ve written so many things off as, oh, we’ve got this. We know. But there’s so much to anatomy –', 'Yeah, and – and don’t think of it –', 'Well, yeah, right, like, just – just – and also your role in other things, right? Like those studies on massage and the benefits of touch aren’t really movement related. They’re happiness related. They are anxiety related, to show that there’s a change in your, you know, not just in your physiological state, but your psychological state. Again, those are two separate words that like, it’s your body. Your body is changed for these things, so if you are – if you’re not feeling well, you know, keep your mind open to be investigating many of these channels to, you know, potential improvement.', 'You’re welcome!', 'Let’s do an air high-five.

It’s called the 100 Mile Club® and it’s for schools, but you can adapt it to like, non-traditional situations, or even just your own family, and it’s for kids to walk 100 miles during the school year. You know, so you break it down, you log it and everything, and so it gives them something – you know, if you’re not just turned on by the idea of just walking, because some kids like to work towards something, and they can even walk towards a medal or a sticker or a certificate or whatever. But yeah, it’s called the 100 Mile Club®, I think you can look it up by that, and it’s for schools to try to get everybody going.

And so she went to the teacher ahead of time and said hey, I’d like to help with this experiment, let’s bring the kids in on it. And they got rid – you know, they pushed all the furniture out into the hall or off to the sides or something, and then with the children, designed a dynamic classroom with, you know, pillows and mats and some standing tables. Things like that. And they did it for a week, and it was just a really good way to see it in practice where it didn’t cost the district or the administration anything. They could just see how it went. So that was a very cool story about that.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'There’s never money.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Right.', 'Right.', 'Yeah, sure. Yeah, shabby or just not uniform.

It’s my contribution. \\xa0 DANI: We appreciate it, too.', 'Thank you! Thank you very much. I might jump on that bandwagon, too. Yeah – there’s just so many different things that you can do. You know, just talking with your teacher, and not putting the onus on them to get it all done, but just saying, hey, what if we tried this? Because I know a lot of times kids just have a little pad they can sit on and they can wiggle and it helps them – you know, just things they do for other sensory issues, but you know, if it helps those kids sit still, it kind of makes you think outside the box of hey, what if there was all sorts of different ways we could move throughout the day? Without losing my lessons.', 'Right.', 'And just a few more resources and ideas besides the great, you know, park & walk plans. If you check out Richard Louv’s site, I think it’s Nature Network? He has great ideas because he has, like you said, you can balance out – if you can’t do anything about the inside-the-desk, inside-the-classroom time, then you work on everything else. And there’s great ideas for getting kids and yourself outside on that site. There’s things like the Walking Classroom that you can apply for your school, um, so kids learn lessons while going on these many mile walks wearing MP3 players, listening to school. And that’s a new thing – that’s a nonprofit that’s pretty cool. And then check out Monkey Bar Math™ – some – oh, what was one good tip from somebody was: she has her kid walk to buy extra screen time. Like, that’s just the tradeoff. If you want the screen time, then you’ve got to walk this amount of time.', 'Yeah. Another parent, when they do like, read-alouds or run spelling words, they sit on the floor with a yoga block and a half dome, and they’re just wiggling all the time, because nobody’s going to sit there like a lump. There’s so many things that you can do if you just step to the right a little bit and think about it, look at it a little differently.', 'And – and it’s school. School is good. It’s fun, fun for learnin’. I like this time of year.', 'Well, I got a couple of mentions to talk about before we wrap it up. I know our last show we mentioned we’d talk more about skin, and we will.

Well, speaking of memorization, it’s the back to school episode. Huh?', 'I was thinking, I’m actually one of those people who loved going back to school.', 'Mmmm.', 'It’s mostly – it mostly is waiting for the bus in the morning. I just – we had to get up really early, and it was really rural, and it would be chilly, because we didn’t start until September because we were a farm community. And I would pretend – my sister and I would pretend to smoke pretzel sticks out while we were waiting for the bus, because that was – that was the height of glamor, back to school, and –', 'Yes, right? It was very realistic.', 'It was – fortunately, I went on to not – I was never a smoker, nor really a pretzel eater, so. It just goes to show you that sometimes by getting it out of your system early on it might save you later.', 'Yeah.', 'I still pretend smoke. I like blowing – I like seeing my breath.', 'I love that, it’s fun.', 'Yeah, I think that’s what it is.', 'Pretend you’re a dragon. Stuff like that, sure. But, anyway, back to school. We get a lot of questions about back to school, so we put them all together, right? Back to school biomechanics – and it’s kind of also like back to work biomechanics, maybe, right?', 'Yeah. So, what about shoes, backpacks, desks, and balancing this kind of back to school – like, there’s less movement time overall, right? So how can we deal with that? Even if you don’t have kids, you can apply probably the bulk of this stuff to you at your office, yeah?', 'Yeah, so – I know just from interacting with readers and listeners on Facebook that parents – and even people with a traditional office job – kind of feel like they’re up against a hopeless situation. You know, it’s like, I can’t – there’s just no way, I have to go to work, my kids have to go to school, we have to have to – and so I think we can offer some empowering things to do, whether you’re in the traditional school system, if you’ve got a more flexible schooling environment or if you’re just at work. So what should we start with? DANI: You are the solution girl! You’re good at providing solutions. \\xa0 KATY: I have ideas, I have ideas. Solutions are all about the person doing them. But yes, what do you want to start with? \\xa0 KATY: Um, okay, bullet points are: It’s best – this is a tip – it’s best to shop for shoes - meaning, your feet are at a good size to be fitted for new shoes – at the end of the day, or after – after the bout of whatever it is that you’re doing. So – it’s soccer time right now. So for example, everyone’s like, I’ve got to get soccer shoes. And they go out and they fit their kids for soccer shoes, but the best time to fit your kids – and yourself – for shoes, especially for sport-specific shoes is after you’ve done the sport. So if you’re a runner, you don’t go shoe shopping in the morning. You go take your run so that your feet are at the size – because your feet are malleable. They’re going to change shape based on the activity and the fluid content that’s in there. So you want to do it after the thing that you’ve just done, when your foot is at its maximum size or shape for whatever that activity was. So if you’re buying shoes for kids, don’t do it, like, early in the morning, before they’ve had a chance to be on their feet quite a bit or use it. You want to go out, and go hiking, go running, go playing. Let them be out for a little bit and towards the end of the day: 3, 4, 5 is a really good time to fit your kids.', 'Kids’ feet grow fast.', 'This is something that we don’t really think of as a – yeah, if you’re a parent, you know. When we just have a shoe size that we are, but your kids, their feet are growing constantly, and so the recommendation is that the shoe for a child is always at least a half of an inch longer than their foot at rest, because again – once you start moving, your foot does not maintain the static shape. It’s stretching, it’s reaching as your weight passes over it, it’s widening and lengthening. So if you fit a shoe to a static foot, which is, interestingly enough – back to school shoe shopping is also a memory of going to Payless Shoe Source and putting your foot on the thing with the sliding dial, did you have that? DANI: I know the word for that! \\xa0 KATY: What is it?', 'Is that the name of the – the – guy, I’m assuming, who created it?', 'It was – but – I remember as a kid, going, he’s like, we have to measure your right foot and your left foot and I was like, “why? You only sell shoes in pairs.” Like – and it was just, and I guess it was just to get the larger one, right?', 'To make sure that the pair fit the larger shoe, but anyway. Brannock device. Thank you.', 'Okay, where was I? All these interesting words –', 'Right. So – well, your foot is going to get bigger and smaller as you’re moving, so you want the shoe to fit the bigger, right?', 'But a shoe that’s too big is just as problematic as a shoe that’s too small – so what are you – so I think the natural response is like, great, well, if my kid’s foot is growing constantly through the year, then I’ll get a shoe that’s like one size too big, and then that way they can kind of grow into it over the year. Because it gets expensive, right? If you have –', '2-3 pairs of shoes a year.', 'You know, we really need to do a parenting episode and you can give us all of your secrets.', 'So, what do you do? You have to buy multiple pairs of shoes per year, and that gets expensive, and so in the blog post I kind of showed how I do it, right? Like, how do you delegate or dispense your shoe budget for the year, and a big secret if you want minimal shoes for kids and you don’t want to spend a lot of cash, is swim shoes.', 'What’s the other word for swim shoes? Like, water shoes, pool shoes?', 'They are – do you have another word? DANI: I think it’s just pool shoes is what I’ve – \\xa0 KATY: Pool shoes. They’re usually at – around here I see them in drugstores, you know, like in the –', 'Yes. DANI: Yeah. And they’re not expensive. \\xa0 KATY: No.', 'Yeah, they’re super cheap, and the cool thing about them is they’re flat. They’re flexible, and they’re inexpensive, so – and they’re usually rubber-bottomed, so even if you live in a wet place – I live in a wet place, in the Pacific Northwest. It’s not super freezing, especially in the fall, right? So I recommend that you get one of those for fall, this early part, because there might be rain on the ground but if you pair them with wool socks you’ve got something that’s warm, water-resistant, flat, flexible and it gets you through til when you’re going to need, like, your – your big guns.', 'Depending on where you live, right? If you live in Southern California, you’re like, what is she talking about? The socks, and boots.', 'Boots? But if you live in, like, where you live, you guys are going to get some snow, yeah?', 'So the best time is closer to when your foot is at the size that you’re going to be using them, so if you’re going to be wearing winter boots then try to buy them as close to winter as possible so that they’re going to match your shoe shape, then. Don’t get excited and buy your winter boots in October, I guess, is what I’m trying to say.', 'Put it off a little bit. So – and then you can buy another pair of inexpensive swim shoes in the early spring or late winter when the snow is over, but you still need a little bit of wet, and um, moccasins or other minimal shoes to kind of – it has, like, how to pace it out a little bit, I guess.', 'That’s good for adults, too.', 'And if you’re a homeschooler, a fun lesson, right? I included that actually in a blog post, a whole link to a homeschool lesson on feet and shoes, so check that out.', 'If you’re inside, sure is.', 'Yeah, and um – you know, when - we could probably do a winter show, like how to move in the winter. But that was – there were a lot of blizzards. Like East Coast, eastern Canada got hit pretty hard with winters last year where they’re like, yeah, okay, walk 3-5 miles a day is just not possible, like, it’s freezing, we will die, Katy Says. It was like, okay, well, what do you – what are ways to create movement indoors and obstacle courses, obstacle courses, obstacle courses are amazing. They’re fun to set up, they are fun for kids and adults to do. And then you can do one just for feet, though. They’re meant to be barefoot and train your feet with all sorts of wobbly, cool balancing. I threw up some pictures, and that’s a good way to strengthen the muscles in your feet, because minimal shoes, again, if you listen – I think back to our episode maybe on the Vibram lawsuit? This was like an early episode that we did –', '-- where when you get, like, on the minimal footwear bandwagon there’s a tendency sometimes to think that just putting the shoe on the foot will give you more movement, but you actually have to be moving, right?', 'You have to be doing more movements and so – like, it’s not a magical foot massage device, like, you actually have to be up and you have to be walking over varied terrain, and if that varied terrain is buried under snow or the outside is not accessible to you, then create a varied terrain inside.', 'Oh my god, I am so cheap.', 'Oh. I’m thrifty.', 'But I don’t think it’s much as thrifty isn’t my motivation. Money saving isn’t my motivation so much as reusing things that already exist is my motivation, so, like, go now before it’s all covered under snow. Go get pebbles. Go find a cool balancing log, bring them in to dry them out now so that when it’s time to set up your winter stuff, you have all that stuff ready to go. Just get a big box. Start putting it in there and then create your kind of foot training kit in your back pocket so the first snow day when you’re like, what am I going to do? It’s like, I already have this plan. I’ve been planning on this since September. It’s fun. I enjoy it, it’s creative. \\xa0 KATY: Walking to school. Cherished – being walked to school – cherished memories. Just, you know, um, walking to school is one of those things that has just kind of gone away –', '-- just because of the way society is now. But escort – like, walking by yourself. I remember when I was in, like, preschool, walking certain distances myself. You know, even like a block – but that just doesn’t happen anymore, ok?', 'Yeah.', 'No, and I remember – I don’t think I thought about it then, like I think about it now. But I remember a sense of independence, and who knows how alone I was? So my son who is 4 just asked the other day if he could walk this quarter mile home by himself. He’s like, can I walk this by myself? And he asked because his 6 year old cousin does it. His mom – we live close enough, and she’ll like, ride her bike to a certain point and then she can watch him walk a certain point and then I’m at the other end and can watch, but the kid doesn’t really know that as much, and so I was like, yeah! Absolutely! And then you know, you drive home and he seemed so big all of the other times until he’s walking down this huge road and I’m like, oh my god, he’s like an ant! He’s so tiny, like a baby, crawling down this thing! And he did the whole thing! And I – there’s just a – it’s being autonomous, right? It’s this whole experience of, “I got this,” and it’s – it was a safe, you know, I felt that there was just no risks or minimal risks, I think for him. Any risk that he can handle, and um – but that’s not an option for a lot of people, so – and also people live too far from where they go to school.', 'where it’s like, okay, I’d like to have 2 extra hours to walk the three miles – you know, my kids back and forth, but I don’t, so our friend, Debbie, from Positively Aligned, has a really great solution for this, and when I went to visit her in Texas, I did this with her and it was genius, but I’ll let you tell it, because it’s just – I just like to hear it.', 'Yeah. It was great. She – so for her, or anyone else going, how can I get more movement? She would drive – I don’t remember exactly what the distance was, but it doesn’t matter – even if it’s – I have little kids, it’s like, great, then do a mile, or do a half mile. Whatever. She would park and walk in and they would play like shadow chasing games –', 'which were great –', 'Sure!', 'But that’s a benefit. That’s awesome, right?', 'Like, she got to use this time to train, and it’s like going to the gym with your kids. Here, carry all my stuff. But then she would walk back and then she would walk in to pick them up and then walk out – so she got twice as much walking as they did, half of it being fast, adult-paced, and then she got to be with them those extra hours. They got to walk, but I love that you pulled out this decompression idea. It wasn’t like, quick! Get in the car! Drive home! It was this whole, relaxing 20 or 40 minutes, however long it is for you of talking but not where people are clamoring for your attention, like, where it can be – it was just more like, we’re just out and running around, and I don’t know. It was beautiful. It felt really good. It was just a great way to break up a day.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, and I think also back to the homeschool – I like to give our alternative schoolers ideas, right? Because you’re constantly figuring out, like, cool lessons. And a good movement lesson would be for maybe older kids – or younger kids, I guess, depending on where they are – would be maybe to keep a walking journal, or to track distance.', 'Even if they’re in traditional schools, to be like, okay.', 'No.', 'Stop telling lies!', 'Mm.', 'A good idea for teachers out there, maybe, who are trying – we get a lot of requests from teachers, going, how do I adjust my curriculum? So, anyway, by doing that! That’s great.', 'All right, what else? Shoes, walking… \\xa0 \\xa0 KATY: Well, that’s – I mean, going up – like, changing a paradigm is huge, so, like you have this – we are these little people with this idea and there’s institutions that have a different idea. So that’s challenging. And I think – I definitely think, it’s kind of like all activism in general, that there is benefit to organizing some sort of intervention against larger institutions that have a particular idea when you’re trying to initiate change. But before we do that, again thinking about the parent who feels overwhelmed, feeling like, Hey! Petition your school district! You know what? Just lay down in front of the desks at your school district – that seems big and overwhelming. So like the first thing you can do, so that you can feel empowered, is to simply change your home environment. So if – if people are shaped by what they do all day, then make sure that your house doesn’t – so setting up where are your kids doing homework? So if you’re like, I don’t like this desk thing, but you have desks for your kids at home, then start with eliminating that. Create standing or floor sitting desk workstations. Um, init – oh, gosh, we came up with a bunch of ideas, right?', 'Right.', 'Yeah.', 'They don’t. Although the problem, I think, for a lot of people comes with – they have one home computer and the kids have to be on the home computer. So if that’s the case, consider – I just posted, um, really on everything: Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, a picture of my new office space. So I –  Don’t Just Sit There  the paperback version, has just been released, and I’m trying – because people still want visuals -', 'It’s a dynamic office!', 'It’s dynamic! I have a low table, like find a low table. Put your computer on the low table, and then the reflex tends to be, well, there’s no way am i – the adults want to sit down there. I’m like, it’s good for you, too, this isn’t about kids; it’s about humans. But then, also, it’s not just the work time: what about the relaxation time, like, you still have the couch, you still have the EZ chairs and like, everyone’s just kind of –', '- sitting. Everything! Like, the whole house – consider again that furniture-free home to whatever extent you can. There’s been again on our social media pages so many good ideas where the family couldn’t quite ditch the couch, so they cut the feet off of it, dropping it 4 inches. That’s huge!', 'Brilliant.', 'Brilliant. Have floor picnics, you know. Eat on the floor sometimes in the dining room. Have family challenges, where if you watch TV together as a family you do it on the floor with kind of fun movement challenges during commercial time. Also –gosh, what else?', 'Ah!', 'That’s awesome! So it’s perfect is what you mean.', 'What you’re saying is it’s perfect as it is.', 'Yeah.', 'You know, I’m not such a good – again, winter. I feel like we need to do a trigger warning for all of the people on the east coast who are just like, stop saying it’s the end of summer! And have all of the –', 'Well, I meant the heavy winters that we just don’t have. You know – consider swapping out your furniture for something fun, family movement time instead of like, all right, we’re going to sit down at this table for an hour. Be together in some other movement way. Put your food off to the side and go get a snack when you get it, and then come and chat and play around the obstacle course or the ping-pong table or whatever else you can think of that would be fun. It’s just, uh, dynamic home. Dynamic because it’s ever changing, dynamic because it doesn’t constrict your movement in any way. So I think that’s kind of a cool thing, and then screen time, right? All the stuff that we’ve talked about before – there’s all these screen-free weeks, but can you do screen free days, or tech free days with your family? Not just with your kids, but with the whole family. You know, consider having it switch off at a certain time, where it’s like, ok, do your homework but the Internet switches off for everyone at 7.

Twister.', 'What do you mean?', 'What do you mean you don’t have to buy it?', 'Well, since this show is now about movement games, since we have this huge section – we stayed at a lake house for kind of our family end of summer hurrah, and they had a um, it wasn’t quite full, full, like – it was like a human-sized game of Jenga. Instead of the little, tiny pieces you hold in their hands, there were huge 2x4s –', '-- that were of the appropriate ratios, and again – I have a picture of it that I put on my Instagram, and like, you squat, right? You’re picking one up at the bottom –', 'It’s not on a table anymore, you’re doing like some sort of weird, inverted squat to get the one out of the bottom, and then you’re reaching and the little kids are way over their head. They had stools climbing up to get them on there and – super fun, right? A human-sized Jenga for more movement. It’s the exact same skillset but – and you also have to sprint if it falls over, because it’s a huge pile of wood.', 'That’s right!', 'There you go!', 'Lots of fun stuff.', 'Winter show. There it is right there: indoor games. \\xa0 \\xa0 KATY: Well, I have a different take on this than I think a lot of people do. So it’s a complex – it’s a complex issue, because yes, they’re carrying more stuff than we are. But I’m not sure that’s necessarily – it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Right? Giving kids more loads to carry is not problematic. It’s kind of what we’re after, right? Having them work more, be stronger. The question is, is piling a bunch of stuff into a backpack the way that we want to do it? So I don’t think – variables are tricky when you’re trying to flush out what the argument actually is. I don’t think that the problem is the weight. Weight is fine. Kids in other places do way more physical work and have the capacity to carry and be much stronger than our kids are currently. But what we have with the backpack is a repetitive load carried in a single way. Again, I don’t think that the weight is too much as much as you’re asking a child who you also ask to be sedentary the bulk of the time to then carry this large burden on their spine, you know. So what is the solution there? The solution there is carrying the load in different ways. I, for a long time, have wanted to create a backpack that was similar - and sorry, fellas, if this analogy doesn’t make sense. But you know, like, you can buy those bras that are like 5 bras in one? It’s like, it’s over the shoulder and it crisscrosses in back!', 'And it’s strapless. So I have long time wanted to create some sort of carrying device that had straps that went in different ways, where you can carry it in different ways. You can, of course, carry a backpack however you want, but you know, we’re talking about – I don’t know, are little kids, are 5 and 6 year olds coming home with 30 pound backpacks? Or when does that phenomenon start? I actually don’t know.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Which one? Are you a lefty or a righty?', 'Sure. Right.', 'You’re like, who are you talking to?', 'I’m saying that – I’m saying that you know, we have an aversion to work and weight and movement. And so it’s easy to see, like, look at all this weight they’re asking the kids to carry, and I’m like, yeah, kids are strong. They should be asked to carry a lot more stuff a lot more often. However - is a backpack - this consolidated load placed on the spine, like, I would find that to be the problem more so than asking them to carry the weight.', 'And so – my kids go to outdoor school, too. They have backpacks, and it’s a little more challenging with tiny – with smaller kids, but keep in mind that they’re also laboring kids, so they are constantly asked to carry and move and hang and swing, and so their bodies wouldn’t collapse under the weight of a backpack the same way someone who did not that much other strength exercise throughout their life would collapse in a backpack. The effect of a backpack is not in a vacuum; it depends on who’s wearing it and what they do all the other time.', 'So for older kids, like your son, varying up how you carry your backpack – and I wrote the pumpkin blog – there’s a pumpkin loads – It’s the Great Loads Lesson, Charlie Brown was one of my annual – the annual lessons I do on pumpkins. I always seem to do a blog once a year with a pumpkin. And so – you know, what’s the difference between carrying 10 pounds of pumpkins all stuffed in a backpack vs. carrying one on your head and a couple on your arms? That weight and how it’s distributed changes the net effect of something, and so – I remember it being cool to not have a backpack, but to have like 3 books in one arm? Right? Do you ever remember walking home just carrying your books with like, papers sticking out?', 'But again, I wasn’t cool, so maybe it’s just what I did.', 'Ooh, two. Two. Because my glasses went over my right and left ear, so my straps had to go over my right – I had to balance the whole thing out, you know? And my – and my permed hair was equally poofy – I was all about symmetry. I was all about – I needed to be a symmetrically a nerd.', 'My mom said I was adorable.', 'Messenger bags. I did get into me – like, I still prefer, like I don’t do any – I like an over the shoulder strap. So over the shoulder strap – do it one way and then the other way, put your backpack on the front. There were a couple kids who did that. You know, carry their backpack on the front like a big pregnancy belly? That’s pretty hip. You should ask your son if that’s hip. You should just start wearing your backpack on the front of your body and see what he says.', 'And then put your butt pack on the back, and your – oh, my gosh.', 'I know. Okay, but – but all of that being said, if you are going – there’s my little kid is carrying all this crazy stuff – lighten their load a little bit with – like, I – we were buying stuff for outdoor school, and it’s like a huge, massive lunchbox, and I was like, what’s this huge, heavy – in outdoor school, because they are hiking, you know, they’re not just wearing the backpack around in between classes – these little kids are hiking a couple miles with what’s on their back. So I do things like, they don’t have lunchboxes. Those are heavy. They have a knit sack – a mesh sack – that I put their food in, because why have the extra weight of a backpack? Look for, you know, water bottles. Look when you’re purchasing items for back to school or what they carry with them on a regular basis, pick things that are lighter.', 'Eliminate the need for – you know, do you need a pencil box? I mean, understanding that we all need a pencil box, do you really need a heavy pencil box in your bag, or could you just, you know, throw a couple pencils in your backpack? Like, there are – there is extra weight being placed in there, and extra bulk that may or may not be necessary, so backpackers will understand that you pare down your weight and don’t take non-essential items. So. Just – I don’t know. I guess other things to think about if um, if the load really is too heavy for the strength of your child right now. Pare it down.', 'As much as you can, like, they still have to bring – can you photograph, or can you buy a duplicate set of textbooks? Some schools do that, right? Like, send their kids home with duplicates? Can you buy, you know, find used online duplicate textbooks so they’re not moving it back and forth?', 'Yeah, and it’s – you know, we think, my kids are carrying too much weight! And then the next question is: how do I exercise my kids more? It’s like, we know where –', 'We are living in the space between two paradigms right now. So you’re getting a little bit of this information, but you’re still within the culture that really goes out of its way to avoid movement, and so there’s this – we live outside of a Venn diagram. We live in this space and it’s slowly overlapping, but it takes a while to start hearing, you know, the questions you’re asking. How, like this is too much work for my child and it’s like, well, too much work is relative. Is there – as your children get stronger and understand variability then it won’t be.', 'So. Anyway. That’s just, uh, again, it’s part of that broader understanding of ergonomics vs. movement, and movement vs. exercise, but I think we got a shout-out in there for working more. \\xa0 \\xa0 KATY: Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, that’s – that’s where change comes from. It comes from super passionate people doing the work. I mean, it’s just work. All this trying to create new curriculum – it’s work. It’s really challenging. I don’t think that there’s a teacher out there who – I mean, I shouldn’t say that. There are many teachers out there who are like, I totally get that sitting in the chairs is not good for the students but it’s the way that the system is set up –', '- and I’m just one person, and in order to change it I would have to have a year paid by someone else where I didn’t have to teach but could just write curriculum. I’ve been working on my curriculum for so long; but there are these people out there who are so passionate about it that they are, in their spare time, creating ideas and curriculum out there to change, I think, the paradigm. And so I would like to point people to a couple of those sources, um, one of them that I’m really excited about it – have you ever met Alex Kane?', 'So Alex Kane, he is um, he’s married to one of our graduates who is a teacher of the movement technique that we use and he was also an American Ninja contestant.', 'You didn’t? Oh, my gosh.', 'Yes, he’s – he’s physically amazing.', 'The only thing kind of being more amazing than his physical capacity is his warmth, and his passion for his community and his family, and for movement. And so he has a website – Monkey Bar Math™. He’s a teacher, and I wrote a blog post about him a couple years ago because he created a chair-free classroom and – but he didn’t just go, hey kids, we’re having a chair-free classroom. The first day of school he was like, Hey, there’s no furniture in here, what are we going to do? And then, you know, it just opens discussions with kids and how do you want to set up the space? And the curriculum was creating a learning space. And so his website, Monkey Bar Math™, is really insightful about what are the subjects that we can start teaching via movement? And so – anyway, go check that out, and then you have some favorites?', 'And I think – you know, I just – that triggered something in me. I think that a lot of the resistance to doing new things in larger institutions is the cost, right? It’s like, well –', '-- we can’t afford it. Totally -', 'There’s never money. I totally get that. Um, and I think, though, a lot of that comes from the idea that you don’t want your kid to go to be schooled in a place that has mismatching – you know, if you said, no problem! You know, all the parents will come together and donate pieces of various heights, and that when you go to that school, there could be the response of like, well, this is sloppy.', 'This is mish-mosh and different heights, and I have been conditioned to uniformity and brand new-ness, and I – I am inferring from this way of everything looking organized that then what happens here is good, and that things that are not clean and disorganized based on my internal um, judgment system, can’t – good things can’t happen here. And that – just for any of you that have ever looked at anything that I’ve put out as far as like, the videos that I’m doing or whatnot. One of the reasons I film, you know, what I do with, you know, my kids in the background – you know – that – that you always want to make sure that you’re evaluating things by the outcome, not necessarily by the appearance of how it looks. And that could be, you know, this idea of what is good, or what is bad based on how it looks might be this huge cultural cast kind of on what is keeping things being the same way over and over again.', 'So just – it’s internal judgment system that is a culturally conditioned – so, anyway. That’s just one thing. Like, I just think of that as – I think that every tea – every person would have this piece of furniture that’s sitting in their garage or whatever, they’d be like, sure I will go down to my kindergarten or 1 st  or 2 nd  grader. As a parent I feel super motivated to get 15 or 20 different pieces of furniture of various heights and stools and pillows and we can get it all donated – but that – the resistance would be –', 'The sloppiness of it.', 'Whatever. Non-uniform.', 'It’s my contribution. It’s my contribution.', 'Thanks. I will continue to not fold my laundry in honor of you!', 'Right – and, you know, again, who is to say that learning happens with stillness? I mean, I think that –', '- there’s a lot of information saying otherwise. So, anyway. That’s – that’s a lot. Like, we have given a lot of information in this podcast.', 'I like that!', 'All right.

What business experts – not me – would call branding, right? You would have – there was the Aligned and Well DVD series, which was filmed maybe like 6 years ago? And then that had its own brand for the series, but then that name kind of fell over onto my social media, right? So my Facebook page was called Aligned and Well.', 'But the brand that’s been around longer, where I spend the bulk of my time is actually the Restorative Exercise™ Institute.

It was – it was like, people would come from all over and they would train with me for about a year. Not every day for a year, but it took about a year for you guys to all go through the certification program, but there’d always be all these questions, and there was, I don’t know, maybe somewhere between 50 and 80 students, and so I would just answer the questions and post it on this blog. It was never a blog written for – for the masses. I certainly never sat down and went, I’m going to start a blog! And I still – I still am slightly incompetent, just -', 'Well, I meant – it’s just not – everyone’s like, I don’t monetize my blog. It’s not – it’s nothing like that. It was just me writing articles to further explain in between classes. People would come for a week and for a weekend and be there all day for 3 days, and then they wouldn’t come back for a month, some of them, and so it was just this fill-in-the-gaps. And then everyone would always explain something that they didn’t quite understand with, “Well, Katy says…” and so it was just like a tongue in cheek kind of name, and now that’s another brand, because now there’s – you know, half a million people who search, “Katy Says,” which is crazy!', 'I wish I would have named it something more awesome.', 'Well, it’s fun.', 'And that’s why no spouses like me.

These are all dot-coms that are available, I’m sure. Anyway, um, so it was very confusing because there were all these people who come to Katy Says. They read a blog, they have no idea about the DVD line or the Institute, and they would just ask these questions, and for some reason, it’s very challenging to get people who came in through a particular thread, whether it was Restorative Exercise™ or Aligned and Well or Katy Says, or they read something on Facebook. They were just never really aware of all of the other information that was there – and there is so much between the three brands. There are so many products and articles and books to read. So it was just hard for me to kind of manage 3 different portals of information, like I was nourishing Aligned and Well and I’m constantly doing – answering questions on those and doing PR for those, and then the Restorative Exercise™ Institute – that’s a particular educational channel. And then there was just like the general thing like this podcast. Maybe people came through the Joe Rogan show – I have someone who has been following me on Twitter for the last year – or I guess it wouldn’t have been a year, probably like 7 months coming through the Joe Ro-', 'Coming from the Joe Rogan show, who just was like, I had no idea you wrote a book.

And I tweet once a day or a couple times a day. So I just thought it was time to have one, cohesive thread that when you pulled it, everything that I’ve already created over the last 12 years was available so that you could start searching for the information that you’ve been waiting for the next podcast – it’s like, oh, I hope she does a podcast on X – like, chances are? I’ve already written 5 blog posts on it. Like, all the questions that we get that people ask, you know, you and I go through these questions, it’s like, these are all answered. It’s like, someone is just sitting there waiting, like, I hope she answers my question! It’s like, I already have! It’s in one of these 3 threads. So – Nutritious Movement is the single thread now where all of these will fold into and when you come – no matter what you come in through, a blog post on Facebook or one of our new DVDs, which we can talk about, you will find a catalogue that you can start searching for your information.', 'Yeah.', 'But it’s not organized well, you know. Because I was never producing content for the sake of making a database of information for people to get better. It’s like, the blog is like my notebook. The blog is like, oh, I wake up and right now I’ve got this thing on eyeballs and I’ve got notes on a piece of paper, and pictures that I’m trying to draw, and I will eventually write a blog post about it, but it doesn’t go with any particular theme. I’m not writing it for this person with myopia wondering how it works, it’s just something that I’m interested in. And so  Alignment Matters  was the first kind of consolidation and organization of five years of chaotic blog writing, you know, where it was organized and then – I’m trying to do that same thing with everything that I’ve ever produced and try to organize it so that it can be more user friendly, because again, I think that people are coming because they’re like, I – I get it. I want to know, now where do I go? And it’s like, well, here’s 3 different websites and 3 different search boxes, so it just wasn’t working. So that’s – we’ll do more talk about Nutritious Movement and all the new stuff that’s coming up, but that was the big one is taking that leap of faith to jump into a brand new name for many different portals, and we’ll see how it goes.', 'Um, mid-November is the deadline. It was huge! It’s like a brand new website, renaming everything. A – new business names, and new everything. You were there, right?', 'When we had our corporate – our corporate meeting, you know, it was like 5 of us.', 'In Vegas. In Las Vegas. After a really amazing hike – we did a – we had a great –', 'Yeah. It was – the way we do our meetings is we all fly in, and then we all go on this super long hike until everyone’s like, seriously? Can we be done now? And get to know each other, and get fatigued, and then come back and stay up all night with white boards and notes, and that decision was made there, so. Hopefully – I don’t even feel – I feel really comfortable like, this time next year for everyone to be like, this was the best decision ever, we’re all better for it. So.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, see? Again, it’s the perfect storm. That little storm cell, that uh – I worked on  Don’t Just Sit There , gosh – when did we do the last podcast on it? Last year sometime, right?', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah – I wrote that book last spring. Uh, spring 2014 I wrote that, and then filmed the videos summer 2014 and then it just took such a long time for it to come out that when it happened to pop out now, it seems like, what, you just wrote another book? But I did the bulk of that work last year, so it just happened to come out now. And the flurry of activity around that was it was originally just an e-package from Marc Sisson. It’s a fan – do you have it? Did you get it? Did I send you a copy of it?', 'There’s so much stuff in it, right?', 'I know.', 'I know.', 'Yeah, the e-book, the audio book. It’s the only place to get the audiobooks. So it’s like, e-book, audio book, videos, and then he, of course, jam-packed it with a bunch of other goodies.', 'Yeah, Yoga Tune-up Balls, workouts, and it was great. But – that’s what it was designed as, and then I was like, you know what? As far as e-packages go, there are, you know, a lot of people who do e-packages, and then there are people who would never, ever download – like, do any package in their entire life. It’s just not on their radar. But books are, so I said, well, I’m going to publish just the print version of this book, which was not my intention a year ago. So the difference between getting a book ready like an e-book ready was way different than getting a book ready for publication; it’s just a much larger process because there are many rules for running them through a publishing house and getting them ready for stores. I mean, this is going to go to Barnes and Noble.', 'This is a cool book – so that – the creative process of the book was behind me. But, um, the administration of getting it publication ready was great, and then of course, any time I revisit something I’m like, oh, this is terrible! I’m totally re-writing it. So the e-book that you guys have, for those of you who bought the package – or who will buy the print book – because I stepped away from it for a year, when I stepped back to it there were so many different things I wanted to say. So I ended up reviewing, I don’t know, 10 or more – I called them research corners. The research corners that are in the book didn’t exist in the first set, because there’s been so much more research into sitting and what the problem actually is with sitting. That’s a new edition. These couple paragraph synopses and kind of explaining some of the research that has been out of late. So that was – those needed to be written and edited, and then a broader reference section, and then of course, a rad cover.', 'Ooh!', 'Yeah.', 'It’s ridiculous.', 'Yeah.', 'I know.', 'Or am I like an amylase or something like that? Maybe I am actually a secretion that kind of breaks it down for you. Maybe like pyloric acid.', 'Oh, totally.', 'All acids are funny unless it’s in your eyes.', 'Yes. So I – you know,  Move Your DNA  will be out in October for 1 year. I mean – this October, it will have been out for a year. So in that time, there’s been 3 other books that will be out.  Whole Body Barefoot, Don’t Just Sit There,  and  Diastasis Recti.  But  Whole Body Barefoot  was really written last year, so was  Don’t Just Sit There.  But  Diastasis Recti  – I just finished – I just finished writing that. So that was really the book that I wrote this year, and I love it. And they’re not booklets – I mean, I don’t –', 'Yeah.', 'Well, I didn’t –', 'I know. I’ve gotten rid of all those extra words as we’ve talked about before. You, as an editor, recognizing my – there’s no superfluous words. Or very few, anyway. Every once in a while there’s a joke that I have to leave in, which is a total waste.', 'It is. It is.', 'It is. It’s a psoas release in a sentence. But I didn’t want to do body-part specific books; I didn’t – I’ve resisted that for a long time, because I’m like, every time we do a show, it’s like, what do I do with my foot, or what do I do for my back? Or what do I do for my pelvic floor, it’s always like, look at your shoes. Like, the impacts of all of your life and all of your other parts on your ailments is such a big concept, I always felt like writing a part-specific book like “fix your feet,” “fix your back,” “fix your knees” was going against the paradigm that I wanted to present, which is that it’s a whole body phenomenon. But what i have found is that people just won’t pick up a book. Like, if you have back pain and the book does not say back pain, you’re not going to pick up a book necessarily, for whole body wellness because it would not occur to you, maybe, that the solution to your back pain was in this whole body book.', 'So I started writing topic-specific books, but they always – they’re educational books in that they’re like, here’s the exercises for your feet or whatever, but the broader reason, you know, that your foot or your knee or your diastasis recti, or your whatever exists is because your overall movement and habitat is out of accordance with what your biology requires. So they’re smaller; they’re easier for me to write because they are on a particular topic and they’re not particularly theory-heavy. Like,  Move Your DNA’s  like, ugh, it’s just so much re-framing and redefining so many things, that it’s kind of cumbersome in that way, where like, but what are the exercises? You know, it’s like – theory is so heavy, can I start with the exercises? So, like, yes, of course you can. And so, these books. These book - I don’t know. They’re not book – I totally get what you mean by booklets. What would we call them? I started – it’s a series. It’s called the Whole Body series. Whole Body is in the name -', '- of every single title. So even the  Don’t Just Sit There  is like,  The Whole Body Guide to Transitioning.  Transition your whole body to a dynamic workstation or a standing desk.', 'It’s a whole body series.', 'But the  Diastasis Recti  book – I mean,  Whole Body Barefoot  was small. Slim. You know, like you said, you could totally stick it in and you could read it quickly, and it’s a great reference book.  Diastasis Recti ’s probably going to be twice as long because there were – are you ready – over 30 exercises.', 'I couldn’t stop! I was like, oh, and this! Oh, and this! So that puppy has got over 30 exercises and it’s still the same size as  Whole Body Barefoot  and  Don’t Just Sit There,  which is – in your hands, right? It’s not a huge, 6x9 book. It’s an 8.5x5 book for those of you who have your rulers out. Hey – did you know', 'Did you know that a dollar bill is 6 inches?', 'That has been – that was one of those helpful tips that has totally changed my life when I need to measure furniture and everything? A dollar bill is 6 inches.', 'Isn’t it? You will totally use it.', 'So whip out your dollar bill and go to your bookshelf, and try to figure out the size of the book that I’m describing. So that book’s coming out.', 'Thick.', 'So it’s the same – we kept the series', 'Yeah, the trim – that’s called the trim – the trim size is the same. But uh, the thickness – we wanted the series, the Whole Body series – to all be the same size, but  Diastasis Recti’s  going to look a little beefy sitting next to the others in the series because it’s got 30 exercises, yo.', 'Wait a minute, it wasn’t coming out.', 'I was. I was going to go binge watch.', 'I was going to go watch a series all day today. No, it’ll be pre-saling in November, early December. Before – before the holidays we should be shipping. Oh, my gosh – I just committed to that. Don’t publish this podcast until January. J/K! J/K! I’m all right, what else?', 'Well, we – I filmed the Aligned and Well DVD series, like I said, 5, 6, 7 years ago? 2009, I think it was. So I guess that’s 6 years ago. And it was 5 exercises to a DVD, you know, back pain, fix your knees and hips or whatever. There are like 5 introductory corrective exercises to help mobilize really particular areas or change the forces for particular ailments that were coming up in the body that didn’t move so well in a particular way. But there are 18 exercises total that were filmed years ago that sat in a can in kind of a workout flow. So what we did was – for those of you who know the Aligned and Well DVD series and bought – there’s 14 discs with 5 exercises each, some of them, like the calf stretch being on almost every single DVD because it’s that important. We created a disc that is the equivalent to a 1-a-day multivitamin. It’s your movement multivitamin. Take it once a day, and it’s got all 18 exercises broken down into 2 workouts. So 2 like 25 and 30 minute workouts, and then it’s got all of your postural adjustments, and how to stand throughout the day all on a single disc. So – I’m excited about that one, because everyone’s like, ok, I have all these separate exercises but like, what’s the frequency or whatever? And it’s like, wait wait, let’s back up – let’s just start with a vitamin. A movement vitamin that you do every single day. It doesn’t – it can be all at once, but it can also be done – I kind of broke it into a morning or an evening workout, like it’s a little bit more mellow. It’s mostly on the floor, so you could do it first thing, or last thing, and then the other one is more stand up, get down, stand up, get down. There’s more movement that’s associated with it.', 'And it’s really – it could be done as a break to your standing workday.', 'It’s totally low-profile, so yeah – you could play it on your work computer in your office and take 25 minutes to run through everything. So you’ll have kind of given a little head to toe nourishment if you do it every day.', 'I actually did the video the other day, I was like, I am so tired of working, and I was like, oh! I’m going to run through it – and I felt amazing! I very rarely do all my exercises that I, you know, create and write about in a flow like that.', 'And it was awesome. It was great – and so I filmed all new intros and out-tros. The opening and the closing, and there’s a bunch of little new components. And then, um, the other DVD we did was –', 'Two!', 'Did you not say DVDs? Sss?', 'Blaaaaah.', 'I’m going to change it now to The Blob.', 'The Bloooob dot com. We did something similar so our most popular DVD for the last 6 years has been,  Down There for Women.  We need to do a pelvic floor show again.', 'Yeah. But the Down There DVD – so it’s like an introductory DVD, motions, motions – that was very Canadian of me. Introductory motions to increase mobility and kind of, uh, how your pelvis is used throughout your day by doing these five exercises again. Five exercises for pelvic health, and that DVD still sells 20:1.', 'Which is – which says a lot just about –', 'Just like – pelvic health is not doing so well right now in our species in this time. And out of all – we’ve got this nice, kind of sample of a head to toe series, like 14 DVDs for neck and shoulders, back, knees, wrists, fingers or whatever. Down There – pelvic health, is 20:1. So the DVD was always – you know when I created the DVD series I still wasn’t even a real popular blogger yet at that time. The big Mama Sweat, you know, Kegel is Not Invited Thing –', '- that came out after this whole DVD series was filmed. That was like a year later. So these were just a small DVD series made for like, pharmacies, where a pharmacy could have a rack and someone could just pick up an easy 5 exercises to make their X, Y, or Z feel better. So it was just kind of gentle, pelvic mobilizing exercises. And then, you know, uh, No More Kegels came out and the squat came out and then fast forward 5 years and I get emails every day about pelvic pain and pelvic health, and it’s like, ok, I did this, what can I do next? So then I thought, well, I can do a new pelvis DVD that has 2 levels of exercise. I’m trying to put more on a DVD so it was the 5 exercises on this new DVD, it’s all new filmed intro and the 5 exercises from the first DVD, Down There, plus one other one. So now there’s 6 what we call foundational exercises, and I added – I filmed both of the DVDs with a man so that –', 'It’s like, we need the men to represent! So I’m trying to, again, consider, you know, there’s a man on the cover, and then the opening title of everything so that if you’re trying to get – it’s really hard, I’m trying to think, if like, there’s a woman listening, it’s like, I’ve been trying to get my husband to do this DVD but he doesn’t want to do 5 Down There crotch exercises, you know, like, whatever! You need to say things differently, you know.', 'So I was like, I am making unisex DVDs, and so I was really conscious on our packaging, and in the filming that there are these men here demonstrating a lot of these concepts that we’re talking about. So the pelvic floor DVD has these exercises, but then it has 5 brand new, next-level exercises, one of them being the Click Clack. The Click Clack!', 'I have never dropped – Click Clack is famous in Restorative Exercise circles, but it’s never been publicly –', '- available. There’s no DVD, there’s no blog posts with it. But it is in the  Diastasis Recti  book and it’s on this new pelvic floor DVD, because it’s an excellent exercises.', 'Click Clack! Click Clack. So, uh, it’s got 5 new exercises for a total of 11 exercises, plus a flow. Plus a 3-minute – everyone’s like, could you put your – put these exercises into like a Vinyasa style flow? So I created –', '- a 3 minute, get up and down, shift your weight around, you know, uh, flow to kind of tie in to see what your hip mobility and lower body strength was in a flowing, dynamic way. So you could run through the whole thing and it’d take you probably forty – you would have 45-50 minutes of movement as your workout. And then there are 5 lifestyle makeover tips, um, about 5 ways to get more movement specifically for the benefit of your pelvic floor put in there. So those are going to hit in the fall – those should be ready in November also.', 'It’s huge.', 'Let’s just do a show on men and everything.', 'No one even knows what it is yet! They’re like, do your best guess at what you think the Click Clack would look like. Send a picture.', 'Oh, and another question – yes, that I get all the time about our DVDs in general – they will be available as downloads. You will not have to buy a cumbersome DVD. There’s no more plastic boxes, there’s an eco-packaging, a thin little disc.', 'And you can also just purchase it as a download.', 'I know, I’m trying to, like, just get with the times. Get with the times, Bowman!', 'Well, to be clear – I did not actually build the building? I just took a brand new, empty building and decorated it.', 'I’m like the Martha Stewart. The Martha Stewart of Restorative Exercise™. DANI: But there’s a place. \\xa0 KATY: There is.', 'I feel like – I’m sorry, but when you said, “there is a place,” it’s triggering a lyric in my head, like, isn’t there a song? But the tune I’m singing it to is an old Birds song. (music cues) There is a place, turn, turn, turn.', 'Oh, I’m sorry. I can’t even hear anything that you’re saying now. You’re talking, but all I’m doing is going through songs in my head and I think it’s Beach Boys. (music cues) There – In my room. I think it’s In My Room.', 'Okay, I’m listening now. Focus, Bowman.', 'Get with the times. Hashtag Click Clack.', 'It’s Click Clack. We’re calling it – we’re deciding between Click Clack and The Blob. We haven’t quite decided. Katy Says, “Come here.” Um – yes, I’m very excited. I kind of left that part out, and that has been another huge occupier of our time is, you know, I’ve had a facility for 10 years in California, and then when we moved to Washington, I had – I didn’t close it, we – we left and other Restorative Exercise™ Specialists took over and started a new business there. But as far as like a large center where I was working out of and teaching, teaching things for the public, not blog – like, actual live courses, live retreats, and then of course, you guys come regularly for continuing education courses. Um, we opened a new facility here and it is the Nutritious Movement Center Northwest. So it’s NWC – I’m sorry. NMCNW. So it’s lots of – looks like mountains with all those Ms and Ns. It’s like a bunch of mountains everywhere. And it is – it’s open – it’s not open to the public yet; it’s open to those certifying through us, so we have Restorative Exercise™ Specialists who train and take advanced courses, and then we have, gosh, 300 new students in one cohort. We do all of our trainings now in cohorts. You sign up at the beginning of a year; we only open the registration, which we are going to open registration in December. When does this podcast go out?', 'Yeah, so if you want to be notified of the certification program, you should go to NutritiousMovement.com and there’s a place where you can sign up to get the newsletter, because we only open it via newsletter for 2 weeks. Because we expect – we expect that the people that we want to certify are the people who have been following for some time, the basic work of thorough understanding, as opposed to someone who just hops on the site and is like, oh, I want to certify! It’s like, you could spend a couple years here, prepping yourself to certify. So that will be at the end of January. We will open the cohort for 2000 who will graduate 2018 because it’s a 2-year program. Anyway.', 'Yeah, I try not to waste anyone’s time.', 'This – this month is just going to be a giant Click Clack.', 'Hash brown! Did you say hash brown?', 'Yeah, it will be open to the public at the end of this year, and then we will have, you know, week retreats, weekend retreats, family retreats – right? Because I am all for being able to do things with your people, you know. With your tribe and not, like – everyone’s people. Everyone deserves accommodation, so. I’m doing classes for the local community, and then privates. And also, we’re setting it up where – a lot of people are in a particular physical crisis.', 'And they’re like, I need hands on, I need instruction for like 30 days to really get it before I go – we have a lot of people come in for like an extended period of time. So we’re setting it up where you can work out of our facility. So you could – you know, you could tell your boss, it’s like, I need to go do this for 2 weeks – 1 week or 2 weeks or 3 weeks or a month and I’m going to relocate to this area. I will be working every day, you know, via remote, so we’ve set it up where you’ve got your printer and your fax and your Wi-Fi, and your dynamic work station area so you can come to the center and get your work done at the same time. So a lot of people think, like, oh, I could never take the time away from work to go do this – I’m like, you know, bosses are reasonable people for the most part, you know, and if you’re like, this is my crisis and if I don’t solve it, then I’m gone completely, or can I figure out this way to do it? And just as a potential solution out there. So I’m excited; the space is – has a big opening door so it’s got a lot of fresh air, and the Olympic mountains.', 'We have floating stairs!', 'But you knew that.', 'Yeah, well, to clarify: they’re stairs attached via chain, not –', 'Yes. They’re like, suspended. So you’ll go up and down stairs probably a couple times a day, even if it’s up a few steps. And when you do it, imagine that what you’re about to step on wasn’t attached to anything else, but able to float, and then you would see as you go up and down when you’re pushing your foot to the right and to the left and to the front and the back, and the floating stairs show you real quickly all of the wonky ways you’re moving your joints and kind of falling into every step so you learn to get out of that habit very quickly. If you just took the floating stairs 3 or 4 times a day, I wonder how much better your ankles, knees, hips, and low back would be just by righting yourself because you could see how you’re moving – where the cast of the ground really doesn’t allow you to see that much. Very good times.', 'They’re noisy.', 'Yeah, but that’s okay.', 'Hit me.', 'Oh, gosh.', 'Well, there’s a lot of questions in that question.', 'Maybe the –', 'Yeah. I would say that the first question is what movement should I consider? The first – what did she say, what movements should I consider after my injuries have resolved? And I would say that, right now, the movements that you should consider are ones that will resolve your injuries. And that goes for everyone listening. So you’re like, trying to – you’re always trying to solve two things. It’s like, what movements do I need, but also how much movement am I willing to do within my regular life? So the movements that you need are those that will resolve your issue, which can mean not even the correct – there’s corrective exercises, right? There’s a ton of corrective exercises you can find through the Institute’s website, or also in any of the books that we’ve put out, and those exercises will resolve your injury while seeing what simultaneously what’s making you a stronger vessel or a vessel more capable of going through pregnancy, delivery, recovery, parenting, right?', 'So there aren’t – like, there aren’t exercises to fix X and exercises to fix Y and exercises to fix Z, which is why I didn’t want to write books with these little tiny titles. It’s like, the exercises you do to resolve your issues are also the ones that I would give to someone who didn’t have those issues who was like, how do I make myself a stronger baby vessel? Carrying. Squatting is definitely on that list – squatting being a category of movement and not a particular type of movement, and so if you go read some of the squatting blog posts, it’s like, squatting in the way, like, as a fitness type exercise, with certain parameters for how it should be done, have many steps along the way. It requires parts and mobility that you might not have yet. So doing all your squat prep exercises would be pertinent, as would walking. Walking is part of what mobilizes you to be able to squat.', 'They’re very inter-related. I’ve seen the 300 squats a day –and again, this kind of goes back to our cultural way of looking at a population of people, seeing what they do, and then extracting one thing that they do and reducing it down to something highly concentrated and then trying to take lots of that high concentration. So squatting populations – yeah, gosh. 300 times a day, I would imagine if you’re doing labor – you know, if you’re laboring or if you live in a place where there’s not furniture or chairs and you’re minding your children or you’re getting food and processing food and you’re going to get up and down, you know –', 'i.e. do a squat 300 times a day, which is different than you doing 3 sets of 100 squats as an exercise.', 'Right. But also, the person isn’t just squatting. That person is moving throughout the day. That movement throughout the day, the distribution – not just the frequency of an exercise – is important. So again, all we see are the squats, but we don’t see the movement in between the squats, and the way that the squats are done. So 300 squats as an exercise prescription is, you know, may or may not have a strong foundation just because you’ve seen people – or you know, I – the reason I’m saying that is because I remember the article about it was like, well, these women squatted 300 times a day through their regular daily life and their labor outcomes were better. So then, I just want to say – beware of reduction.', 'Beware of reduction, because you could very well be losing the thing that was happening, because it wasn’t the thing you saw as clearly as the 300 squats. So it’s – that’s why we talk about movement in terms of nutrition. Like, if you see someone eat and not starve, you know, on X number of oranges and you figure out how much vitamin C per orange and then you take only the vitamin C, well, it’s like, now you’re missing the calories, and now you’re missing the water. Like, you can’t substitute –', 'And the chewing! Right? And the use of your arms to open it. You can’t really extract that 300 squats as a prescription. But what I recommend more often would be to live similarly, you know, watch your furniture, watch your furniture use, limit your furniture use so that you yourself are doing a version of getting up and down off of the ground 300 times. Use a squat toilet. If you want to supplement with a few exercises, that’s fine. But that – this population is not doing 300 exercise squats, they’re just moving in a particular way. Which I think is pretty well outlined in  Move Your DNA. Move Your DNA  would probably be a good book for her, I think.', 'Ooh.', 'Like, as a hit man?', 'Take me out. All right, I can! Thank you guys all for listening. Dani – I just want to say, you’re amazing.', 'Thanks for hanging with me so often, I appreciate it. But I also want to ask what’s up with you, anything new? DANI: No – well, yeah. I’m just kind of starting to meet people around here that actually listen to the podcast, and go to heir studios and check things out. And you have a huge amount of fans, and I kind of just, you know, get that kind of fan runoff for people that listen. But they’re just the nicest people that follow your work, so. I don’t know. There must be some sort of correlation there. But just very thoughtful people. \\xa0 KATY: What about your – are your kids back? You’re homeschooling this year?', 'I do not feel like your household has any problem with the drama. I feel like, I feel like you’ve got drama covered. But theater’s different, that requires many flairs.', 'Aw, I love it! I’m totally going to come and visit.', 'We should do – I should do a book signing there when  Diastasis Recti  comes out if there’s enough studios there. I would totally come there and we could do – oh! We could do a live Katy Says in front of an audience.', 'We’ll plan on that.', 'Yeah, could you just do that, in between watching all this Orange is the New Black?', 'What’s the other show? The thrones one? What’s the one that everyone watches?', 'I know you are. I love that about you.', 'Yeah, I appreciate it.', 'It’s Katy Says right now – I mean, at a certain point, all the websites will point eventually to Nutritious Movement, but – Katy Says. Come see me at Katy Says!', 'Um – what’s my name again?', '#ClickClack.']}\n"
