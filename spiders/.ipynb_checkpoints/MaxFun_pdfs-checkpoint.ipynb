That was the sound of a sultry saxophone \\nsteam on the streets of this city, coming up from the subways. [imitates \\nsaxophone] \\nRachel:  When we took last week off— \\nGriffin:  Yes.  \\nRachel:  We thought, “It‟s a holiday week, let‟s treat ourselves.” \\nGriffin:  “Let‟s treat ourselves so right.” \\nRachel:  And then the week that followed, we, uh, lost our childcare.  \\nGriffin:  Had a b-b-b-brush with COVID.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. So far, everybody‟s fine.  \\nGriffin:  Everything‟s okay. Everything‟s alright. But we‟re in love lockdown over \\nhere, and it‟s uh… \\nRachel:  So, our recordings got a little more…. \\nGriffin:  A little more…  \\nRachel:  A little more night time.  \\nGriffin:  Little more night time! \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  A little more anxiety! A lot more exhaustion! A lot of just, sort of, like, \\nexistential dread and also just more exhaustion. And it‟s like, will it— is this all \\ngonna be… like, are we almost finished? No? Aw, shoot! Lot of those vibes. But \\nalso, the saxophone and the scene from the city subways.  \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\nGriffin:  Fuuuuck.  \\nRachel:  The music of the night.  \\nGriffin:  Love it. [vampire voice] “My children,” you‟re doing a bit of a dra— you \\ntook it in a bit of a Castlevania direction. I‟m not hating it.  \\nRachel:  Oh, see I was thinking, like, Phantom.  \\nGriffin:  Phantom was based on Dracula and the Castlevania series of video \\ngames.  \\nRachel:  Oh…  \\nGriffin:  Not a lot of people know that. Yeah. It‟s just, IP theft, is what it is. So, \\nanyway, this is Wonderful, talk about things that we like, things that we‟re into, \\nsmall wonders now. Do you have them? \\nRachel:  I do, actually.  \\nGriffin:  Okay.  \\nRachel:  I wanted to talk about the difficult-to-find but worth the watch movie \\nwhich is Muppet Family Christmas.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah! Ooh, you can only get this one basically on the dark web. We \\ntraded some… I won‟t be specific because I don‟t wanna get busted, but we \\ntraded some pills for this Muppets Christmas special on the dark web.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] And they were just fiber gummies, so we‟re… lucky.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s just— yeah. The real ones. Do you know what I mean? Not the ones \\nyou an get at Walgreens. The ones that‟ll hollow you out.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  But anyway, this Muppets movie is great.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. And I don‟t even wanna say where we found it, because if too \\nmany people go to the same place, it‟ll get taken down. \\nGriffin:  Wasn‟t it just YouTube?  \\nRachel:  … [sighs] maybe.  \\nGriffin:  [laughs] okay.  \\nRachel:  Um… so, the thing that‟s great about Muppet Family Christmas— and \\nI‟m not talking about A Very, Very Muppet Christmas, which is a different film.  \\nGriffin:  Or the Muppet Christmas Carol.  \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\nGriffin:  Which is, again, a third film.  \\nRachel:  Muppet Family Christmas is literally across the Muppet continuum.  \\nGriffin:  Right. The Hensonverse.  \\nRachel:  The Hensonverse. And so you‟ve got, I mean, you‟ve got your Muppets \\nfrom, you know, The Muppet Show. You‟ve got your Muppets from Sesame \\nStreet, you got your Muppets from Fraggle Rock. Everybody‟s together.  \\nGriffin:  I think that‟s it. You don‟t get that, you don‟t get that Dark Crystal.  \\nRachel:  No. [laughs] \\nGriffin:  You don‟t get the, uh— \\nRachel:  I think you get some Labyrinth Muppets, though.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, you think? \\nRachel:  I can‟t— I can‟t be 100% on that. Maybe Bunny Picnic Muppets? \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  There‟s a fair amount. But, um… \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  Bowie shows up for like a second.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  And is like— his hog is just showing and Gonzo‟s like, “That looks like \\nmy nose!”  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  But anyway.  \\nRachel:  But anyway. [laughs] Aw, now I can‟t— \\nGriffin:  You forgot what you were talking about.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. No, so the reason that this is not available, you know, for \\nexample, on the Disney app, is that they did the thing that a lot of programs did \\nfrom that time period where they did not license the music in perpetuity, and so \\nwe are not able to see it now, uh, officially.  \\nGriffin:  No.  \\nRachel:  But it is so nice.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s a breath of fresh air. It‟s very nice.  \\nRachel:  So charming.  \\nGriffin:  Um, I just wanted to talk about an extended, like, half-hour long \\nconversation Rachel and I had last night. This is my small wonder. Where we \\nbasically wrote up a whole business proposal for a sausage restaurant here in \\nAustin.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  I‟ve been very much craving German food since last night, when we \\nstarted talking about German food. And I realize that there is a, just sort of a \\ngap, a gap here in Austin where there‟s just like, two German restaurants. \\nThere‟s lots of places that have certain things, but there‟s only, like, two \\nrestaurants that do German food. But nothing that‟s like, that I could get right \\nnow if I needed to.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  And we should say that this came about because we have been \\nwatching the recommend sausage videos from our previous episode.  \\nGriffin:  Oh my God. Whoever suggested Ordinary Sausage, thank you, thank \\nyou, thank you. It‟s filling the gaps. I am down to clown with whatever they \\nwanna stuff inside a sausage. Rachel is a bit trepidatious.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, they get pretty gross. Because he will take items and grind them \\nup and then put them in that sausage casing and eat them.  \\nGriffin:  Which is a lifestyle I really wanna be a part— I really wanna be a part of \\nthat community.  \\nRachel:  No, I understand that about you. Uh, it can be a little grotesque, but \\ncharming and also has made us crave sausage.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah, would love some sausage. So, we came up with, like, several \\nnames, one of which I can‟t remember because they probably weren‟t very good, \\nbut like, business plans about, like, how we could get the word out, what kinda \\nlike combo meals we could offer. There was something about schnitzel bites? \\nRachel:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and there was a lot of plays on, like, wurst and brat.  \\nGriffin:  None of those were good. None of those were good. But we did get, like, \\nschn—pretzel and brats, which now, saying it out loud, makes— does sound like \\nWetzel‟s Pretzels.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  So, we would bump into some stuff there. But yeah, just doing a long \\nsort of imagination scat with my wife.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  In bed. Was a fun one, it was fun. Imagination scat with my wife in bed \\nsounds… \\nRachel:  Yeah, don‟t google that.  \\nGriffin:  Not great.  \\n \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Hey, you go first this week.  \\nRachel:  Oh, hooray! My first thing is journalism.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs] You‟re welcome.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  [laughs loudly] \\nRachel:  It‟s a big topic.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah! \\nRachel:  I‟m gonna do just kind of a crash course through some big milestones in \\nthe history of journalism.  \\nGriffin:  Sure, mm hmm.  \\nRachel:  This is something that I had wanted to pursue, uh, and truth be told, \\ndidn‟t largely because I was not allowed in. [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Huh. Well Mizzou‟s journalism school is no fucking joke.  \\nRachel:  So, at the… at the Mizzou journalism school, your freshman year, you \\napply and you have to have taken, like, the introductory course, which I had, but \\nyou also had to have a certain GPA which I did not have. And there was an appeal \\nprocess, but I was too proud to do it. \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  And very quickly discovered that being an English major was a better fit \\nfor me anyway. But— \\nGriffin:  And easier, right? \\nRachel:  [laughs] Well… papers are longer, I have to imagine.  \\nGriffin:  That‟s fair, yeah.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  Um, I— I have always really respected journalists, I have always loved \\njust kind of the art of the interview. I love the, kinda, the curiosity that comes \\nwith the profession, and what you can accomplish in that position. And also, I feel \\nlike there are so many people, uh, that are important that become so removed \\nfrom your access. You know? There are people in politics, there are people, you \\nknow, in movies and music that you will never meet, you will never talk to. And I \\nalways really respect the, like, really great journalist that gets this great story \\nthat gets you access to information you wouldn‟t get otherwise.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah, of course.  \\nRachel:  Um, and, I mean, especially now, when everything feels so crazy, to \\nhave like a really thorough investigative journalist look into something, it gives \\nyou such peace of mind. It‟s like the opposite of being gaslit, you know? You‟re \\njust like, “Oh. Oh, there‟s real information and out there and you got it, and now \\nI feel safer because of it.” \\nGriffin:  Yeah, sure.  \\nRachel:  So, I wanted to talk a little bit about, like, newspaper and television. \\nUm, cause I think part of what really inspired me initially when I wanted to be a \\njournalist was 60 Minutes. [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Okay…  \\nRachel:  My family would watch it every Sunday night and it just, like, some of \\nthose pieces really, like, stuck with me and made me feel like, “This is kind of a \\nrock and roll job.” \\nGriffin:  You watched 60 Minutes with your parents growing up? \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  That‟s kinda— you understand that‟s a bit wild? \\nRachel:  Well… I don‟t think it‟s that uncommon.  \\nGriffin:  I don‟t know. I mean, well, we watched Rescue 911. That‟s different.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  That had a number in it? \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  Well, how did you decide to be a journalist? Was it just like a practical, \\n“this is a job I could do,” or… ? \\nGriffin:  Uh, it was mostly a fascination with the radio station, because my dad \\nhad done radio and I‟d been around it my whole life. And Marshall had a great \\nradio station. And Justin, at that point, Justin was writing for the Ironton Tribune \\nand I dunno, I had done, like, some of it in high school and kinda enjoyed it and \\nalso, the track I was on before that was to be a theatre major, which I also \\nrealized was not the right one. But I dunno. Some of those skills proved useful, \\nso I think I chose correctly.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, people don‟t talk about that enough, you know, how lack of \\nexposure to certain careers will prevent people from pursuing things. But like, it‟s \\nso clear in your family, like, you all were like, “Well, these are the jobs there are.” \\nGriffin:  These two.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  So, newspapers, as we kind of know them today, really took off in the \\n19th century thanks to high-speed printing presses, the expansion of elementary \\neducation, which meant more people were reading, and also, the sale of \\nadvertising. So, all of a sudden, the newspaper thing became a thing that you \\nwere trying to get the biggest circulation so you could get the most advertisers so \\nyou could make the most money, which is where you get people like Pulitzer and \\nHearst and the incredible musical Newsies.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, God yes.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] This is in, like, the 1840s, 1850s.  \\nGriffin:  Not much to report on back then. Quiet times.  \\nRachel:  Famously with Pulitzer and Hearst, this is where you get this, like, \\nmuck-raking yellow journalism, which is both exposing corruption but then also \\ncreating these sensational news stories just to sell papers.  \\nGriffin:  I would love to do a side-by-side comparison with some of the stuff that \\ncomes out today with that stuff.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  I know.  \\nGriffin:  Would it be like, “And this man, this scoundrel—” it‟s like, “You! You‟ve \\nlost your ethics!” \\nRachel:  [laughs] Television news kind of became what we know in the 60s, \\nspecifically with the assassination of JFK.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, yeah.  \\nRachel:  So, CBS news was the first to report it and then CBS and then the other \\nstation at the time, which was NBC, were just covering it, just the entire, start to \\nfinish, just 24-hour-a-day coverage of everything associated with the \\nassassination. Uh, which kind of created this demand among people of like, if \\nsomething‟s happening, I wanna know about it as its happening. And then the \\nkind of, the news man, uh, that we kind of think of today from that time period, \\nwas the 1950s. Murrow, Edward R Murrow was a radio man.  \\nGriffin:  Fuck yeah. God I love— have you seen Good Night and Good Luck? \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\nGriffin:  that movie rips, man. My man Straithairn in the mix, crushing it.  \\nRachel:  I know, so good. He was primarily radio, and then in the 50s started \\nbecoming a television man. And Good Night and Good Luck is all about the \\nJoseph McCarthy series that he did. \\nGriffin:  If you have not seen it, I cannot recommend it highly enough. \\nEverybody is putting in some work in that movie, it is good.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. Although George Clooney… I mean, obviously… \\nGriffin:  George Clooney is George Clooney in the movie.  \\nRachel:  Instrumental in the creation of the film… his role…  \\nGriffin:  It‟s alright. It‟s whatever.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. Yeah. [laughs] Uh, and then I wanted to talk about 60 Minutes \\njust a little bit, just because that was kind of my inspiration for this. So, that‟s \\nbeen around for over 50 years now. It has won more Emmys than any other \\nPrime time program on US television. It‟s over 130 Emmys. And what happened \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nwas the producer of CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite wanted to spin off a \\nshow that was supposed to be kind of like a life magazine, that was a mix of \\nserious and light stories. Uh, which it took him a while to kind of get support for \\nthat, because everybody was holding up Edward R. Murrow and like, investigative \\njournalism, and he‟s saying like, “Let‟s make stories that are a mix of both, that \\nare more accessible and more engaging for a wider audience.” And, uh, yeah, it \\nobviously was a huge hit. I was a big fan of, uh, of the orig, you know, Morley \\nSafer, Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley, and of course the late, great Andy Rooney.  \\nGriffin:  Oh.  \\nRachel:  Maybe not great.  \\nGriffin:  Late, definitely.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] Definitely late. Um, yeah, it just, it‟s a profession that I think is \\nreally respectable, and obviously there are people that don‟t do it well and there \\nare problems with it, but I think the intent of it and when you see somebody do it \\nwell, can be a real inspiring, important thing.  \\nGriffin:  Yes. I agree. I wish I had been better at certain parts of it. It was just \\nthe confrontational aspect of it that I was just not— I mean, you know me as a \\nperson. I love talking to, like, artistic people and people making shit that I was \\ninterested in, and getting to like, interview them in a way that I felt like, “I can \\nget some stuff out of you that will be interesting to people like me reading this,” I \\nloved that part.  \\nRachel:  Yeah! \\nGriffin:  But anything more sort of like, extra than that, anything more, like, \\n“Hey. Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!” \\nRachel:  [laughs] Of course, the great journalist from Back to the Future.  \\nGriffin:  [laughs] Yeah.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, no, I mean it takes curiosity, obviously, and like, tenacity. But \\nalso, I think that thing that you bring to the table is the enthusiasm.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  You know, like— \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  But it‟s a separate— it‟s like two separate— and it‟s a whole \\nconversation that is easy to be like, condescending either way about, but it‟s just \\nlike— \\nRachel:  Well, I don‟t want you to sell yourself short, Griffin.  \\nGriffin:  That‟s fair.  \\nRachel:  I think you did good work out there.  \\nGriffin:  Then I‟m gonna prove my journalistic chops by talking about my first \\nsubject.  \\nRachel:  Okay.  \\nGriffin:  Which is Ramune, the Japanese soda, uh, that is— and this is hard-\\nhitting stuff, babe, I took it all the way to the top. And I was slamming my hands \\non a lot of desks.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  I threw my briefcase and I was like, “It‟s time to stop lying! You‟ve been \\nlying for so dang long!” It‟s a good soda. Have you ever— actually, I know you‟ve \\nwatched me drink it before.  \\nRachel:  I have tasted it, and I have to admit that the other day when you drank \\nit I did look at the bottle to see how much sugar was in it, just out of curiosity.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, what was the— where did we land on that? \\nRachel:  18 grams for that little bottle.  \\nGriffin:  That doesn‟t seem like a— I guess it is quite a bit. \\nRachel:  I mean, for context, Henry‟s child Z bar has like, 12 grams, so.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s more than a child‟s granola candy bar. Okay, well that‟s not great.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Ramune has a ton of different versions, but the original was a lemon \\nlime-adjacent flavored bubbly soda that was first sold in Japan in 1886. It was \\ncreated by a Scottish pharmacist named Alexander Cameron Sim. And I didn‟t \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nrealize this, and maybe I should have, but the name is actually a Japanese \\nborrowing of the word lemonade. Which I find strange, because holy shit, it \\ndoesn‟t taste like lemonade. It is not like lemonade even a little bit, I feel like.  \\nRachel:  I mean, it‟s sweet and citrusy.  \\nGriffin:  I don‟t find it citrusy very— the best way that I‟ve heard it described it \\nlike, if you took Sprite and then you put some ice in it and you let that melt a \\nlittle bit, and then you threw a bunch of bubblegum into the liquid.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] See, I was gonna say it‟s more like Sprite resin.  \\nGriffin:  Sprite— it‟s Sprite leavings. It‟s a very popular drink that you‟ll find at \\nlike, any Japanese import shop, like, it is for sure going to be something that they \\ncarry, because it‟s a beloved beverage over there. Especially in summer, it is like \\na sort of Japanese staple.  \\nRachel:  Is this the one with the marble in it? Or is it only sometimes?  \\nGriffin:  This is the one with the marble in it, and that is the most interesting \\nthing about Ramune. Folks also call it marble soda. Um, and the bottle that \\nRamune comes in, if you‟ve never seen it, has a chamber inside the neck of the \\nbottle, like a second interior chamber that you can see through the clear glass, \\nand it contains a small, clear glass marble. And when you buy the bottle of \\nRamune, the reason why that sort of shape exists is that the carbonation is \\npowerful enough that it just pushes the marble up into the top. There‟s like an o-\\nring on the mouth of the bottle, and so the marble is pushed up into that by the \\ncarbonation. So, it‟s like holding its— the carbonation is holding itself in because \\nof the way that this bottle is designed.  \\nAnd that‟s why when you wanna open the marble soda, you twist off the cap and \\nthere‟s a little plunger inside the cap that you have to pop out, and then you push \\nthat down into the marble to give way for the carbonation to shoot out. And then \\nthe marble falls into the neck and then you can drink it. And it‟s kind of an— it‟s— \\nit is novel and it is cool and it‟s fun and it‟s satisfying, but it‟s also kind of \\nannoying to drink out of that bottle, because if you‟re really tilting it up and \\nripping it, then the marble just pops back into the o-ring and then it seals back up \\nagain and you can‟t really chug it.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. You know, I have tasted this soda before. I don‟t think I „ve ever \\nwitnessed the process of opening it.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  Oh, really? \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s like, so fun. It‟s like a fun thing to do. It is— it keeps the soda \\nbubbly as hell. Like, it is an extremely carbonated beverage. And what I found \\nextra surprising is that it wasn‟t— Ramune did not invent this bottle design. In \\nfact, it used to be, a long time ago, like, a fairly common way of keeping bottled \\nsodas or bottled beers or any sort of carbonated bottled beverage carbonated. It \\nis a style of bottle that was designed by a guy named Hiram Codd in 1872. And \\nthey‟re called Codd bottles. Which sounds… nasty.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  And lots of soft drink makers in Europe and India and Australia used the \\nbottle design to keep their drinks fizzy back in the 19th century. But the design \\nwas replaced with other technology that was a little, I guess, cheaper to use, \\nprobably? And also because it‟s a little bit annoying to drink out of the bottles.  \\nRachel:  I think Codd bottles sounds like the name of a villain in, like, an old \\nBatman TV show.  \\nGriffin:  Yes, I mean, I think Oswald Copperpot is the name of The Penguin.  \\nRachel:  Maybe that‟s what I‟m thinking of.  \\nGriffin:  So you‟re maybe not that far off. Another thing is that kids used to just \\nsmash the bottles to get the marbles out.  \\nRachel:  That‟s— I mean, I wondered that, right? Like, to me, I‟m so used to a \\nchild‟s product that comes with a toy that I assumed like, am I supposed to be \\nable to keep this marble somehow? And is there a— \\nGriffin:  You can. I‟m an adult man. And we got Ramune, like, I think we got it \\nwith some delivery earlier last week, and I was just looking at that marble like, \\n“That‟s a nice— that‟s a good marble. I mean, we should recycle this, but…” \\nRachel:  Are you supposed to smash the bottle? \\nGriffin:  No. Are you supposed to smash the glass bottle? \\nRachel:  How do you get the marble out? \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  You don‟t, you just recycle it. See, that‟s what I‟m saying. You and I are \\nboth operating form this place of just like, “Well I can‟t leave the marble! That‟s a \\nperfectly good marble!” \\nRachel:  Yes! \\nGriffin:  And kids in the fucking, like, early 1900s were like, “I want to play \\nmarbles.” \\nRachel:  “Of course, marbles is a game that I play.” \\nGriffin:  Fucking free marble, are you kidding me? \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s like if I got a Josta and there was a pog that was instrumental in \\nopening the soda, but then they were like, “Oh but don‟t— you can‟t get the pog \\nout without destroying the Josta.” It‟s just, I don‟t know. Kids were— \\nRachel:  Maybe it‟s like one of those Cracker Barrel puzzles where if you turn the \\nbottle just right, the marble pops out.  \\nGriffin:  Ah, maybe.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Today, there‟s really only two main soft drinks that sue the Codd bottle \\ndesign. One is Ramune, the other one is an Indian beverage called Banta that I \\nhad never heard of before. Um, that‟s it. They‟re the only ones that use it. And \\nthat is, to me, I think, pretty delightful. Because it is such a— I remember the \\nfirst time I saw Ramune, I was like, “What the… what the fuck is going on in \\nthere? Like, what is this space-age bottle technology?” As it turns out, it‟s from \\n1870s and, uh, is not the most practical thing. But it‟s charming as hell.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, as evidenced by the fact that you can get a can of soda and you \\njust… \\nGriffin:  Just pop it.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  And just drink it. Like, if it‟s a hot— I think every time I‟ve been to \\nJapan it‟s been pretty hot, and I always reach for a fucking dripping, glistening \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nbottle of Pocari Sweat. You don‟t have to fuck with any marbles with Pocari \\nSweat, you just rip that shit— \\nRachel:  Or a C. C. Lemon. \\nGriffin:  C. C. Lemon I— C. C. Lemon‟s a little too sour for me these days.  \\nRachel:  Oh… \\nGriffin:  Pocari Sweat? Oh my God.  \\nRachel:  It‟s good.  \\nGriffin:  I should „a just done— what am I— this is a fucking joke.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  I shouldn‟t have done Ramune when I could‟a talked about Pocari— next \\nweek, look forward to Pocari Sweat. I‟m gonna do a whole thing on Japanese \\nbeverages. Also, Ramune has been produced in 55 different flavors. I‟m gonna— \\nand this is not like a, isn‟t Japanese food so weird segment, because most, I \\nthink, is really good. They make a melon flavor that I genuinely very much like. \\nIt's radioactive, fuckin‟ ecto-cooler green, and I think it is super, super tasty. But \\nthere are some more, I would say, novel flavors. Those include champagne, chili \\noil, curry, kim chi, octopus, takoyaki sauce, teriyaki and wasabi. And one that‟s \\njust called Disco Dance.  \\nRachel:  Ooh… that sounds fun! \\nGriffin:  I would be surprised if Disco Dance was still in circulation. Might be \\nwrong on that. I‟m sure I‟ll get fact checked by our audience. I do wanna drink a \\nDisco Dance marble soda.  \\nRachel:  I like thinking that maybe Disco Dance is just all of the flavors \\ncombined.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, shit… \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  That may not be— that probably wouldn‟t be good. I think you could \\nprobably have all the, like, fruity flavors of Ramune, and then have like, a little bit \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nof chili oil and a little bit of curry in there, and you would know what was up. Hey, \\ncan I steal you away? \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\n[ad break]  \\nGriffin:  We have two bumbobobs and I would love to read one of them, and \\nthen I think maybe you should read the other one of them? \\nRachel:  Okay.  \\nGriffin:  Are you okay with that? \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  Well, here‟s the first one. It is for Sarah, it is from Gary, who says, \\n“Dear Sarah, you are the most wonderful person in my life. These last two years \\nhave been amazing, you are my good, good girl. Love your boyfriend, Gary.” \\nLove your boyfriend Gary.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] Yeah, it‟s a command, really.  \\nGriffin:  Love YOUR BOYFRIEND— that wasn‟t part of the message.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  This is me suggesting… \\nRachel:  Hey, love that boyfriend.  \\nGriffin:  Love your boyfriend. Garyyy. Love your boyfriend, Gary.  \\nRachel:  I‟ve got a concise message here for Cookie, from Remy.  \\n“Cookie, you‟re a good friend. Thanks.”  \\nThat‟s the message.  \\nGriffin:  I appreciate that. I also appreciate in the „pronunciations you need to \\nclarify‟ segment of the message they‟re just written, “No, but I love you guys.” \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  That‟s nice. Maybe, cause I don‟t know if it‟s kooky or cookie, the field \\ncould have been used to better effect. But we appreciate the admira— we \\nappreciate that love. It is hard out here.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] Uh, speaking of personal messages, we have an \\nannouncement, and that is… if you wanna get a personal message, now‟s your— \\nnow‟s your chance.  \\nGriffin:  Yes. If you wanna get your very own blumbojob on the show— \\nblumbojob is too much.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Blumbojob, again, sucks.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, you have to stop. You have to stop. Especially when we are telling \\npeople how to do it.  \\nGriffin:  Yes.  \\nRachel:  We should probably use the right— \\nGriffin:  It‟s important that we say the word correctly.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  If you want to get your very own junkotran message on the show, then \\nthe way that you do that is you head to MaximumFun.org/JumbotronDrawing and \\nthen you can sign up for a slot.  \\nThe way it works is there is a lot of demand for this, uh, this service, and we only \\ndo two an episode, so we don‟t have enough to fill the demand, but if you wanna \\ntry and get a message on the show, just go to that link, \\nMaximumFun.org/JumbotronDrawing. You have until Tuesday, December 29th. \\nThe message are 100 bucks a pop. You‟ll have the option to buy one if your name \\ngets drawn.

Yeah.  \\nRachel:  It‟s that piney smell. \\nGriffin:  That piney, piney smell. God. Don‟t you sometimes wish we lived in the \\nPacific Northwest? \\nRachel:  I mean, I have never been, so it‟s difficult for me to say that \\nconfidently.  \\nGriffin:  Ah, shame.  \\nRachel:  But it looks very pretty.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s great up there. God, my second home.  \\nRachel:  Oh, yeah? \\nGriffin:  Uh huh. The whole region.  \\nRachel:  So… where does that put West Virginia? \\nGriffin:  First home.  \\nRachel:  First home. And then where we are now? \\nGriffin:  Uh, first— that‟s first home, actually.  \\nRachel:  Okay.  \\nGriffin:  You can have more than one first home.  \\nRachel:  Oh! \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  Yeah, no.  \\nRachel:  Ohh… \\nGriffin:  Yeah, no, everything is— it‟s part of a sort of tiered, sort of pyramid \\nsystem.  \\nRachel:  Oh.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  Your cup overfloweth.  \\nGriffin:  It does. Got a lotta homes.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  In different area codes.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] Um, I love this piney smell. I, uh, I‟ve had many conversations \\nwith people about the perfect pine candle.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, where are you at on that? \\nRachel:  Well, I‟m still not 100% sure, you know? \\nGriffin:  Oh, wow.  \\nRachel:  Um, you know, obviously the Yankee Candle really sets itself apart from \\nthe rest, but I‟ve experienced many, you know, many positive, positive variations \\nof the pine candle.  \\nGriffin:  We‟ve been sent some fine holiday-themed candles. I can‟t remember \\nspecifically if we‟ve gotten any pine ones.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. Well, you know, I mean I will seek them out every season.  \\nGriffin:  Sure.  \\nRachel:  Because we, you know, we do that artificial tree.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah, it has no stink.  \\nRachel:  No. [laughs]  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  It has the stink of plastics.  \\nRachel:  Uh, and so I did a little research into what it is about that smell.  \\nGriffin:  Okay.  \\nRachel:  This is from a website that I assume is reputable, but it is called \\nEarthSky.org.  \\nGriffin:  Okay, that sounds right.  \\nRachel:  I mean it seems like that, I mean, that‟s what we‟re talking about here, \\nright? \\nGriffin:  If I wanted to know what a good pine smell is and what makes it, I think \\nEarth Sky is where I would turn to for that news  \\nRachel:  Uh, so that pine smell is due to chemical compounds called terpenes. \\nTerpenes are carbon and hydrogen atoms and they are made up of… pinene, \\nwhich is a monoterpene that have the piney odor, and limonene, which is another \\nmonoterpene that has the citrusy odor.  \\nGriffin:  Are all terpenes so explicitly named, or is one called, like, caramelene, \\nand this one smells like caramel? \\nRachel:  [laughs] You know, I didn‟t go to school for terpenes, but I‟m sure \\nsomebody out there did.  \\nGriffin:  How do you say that word? C-A-R-A-M-E-L? \\nRachel:  I say „car-mel‟. \\nGriffin:  Okay.  \\nRachel:  Mm hmm. I‟m a very busy woman.  \\nGriffin:  [laughs loudly] \\nRachel:  [laughs] So, many types of organisms produce terpenes, including \\ninsects, marine algae and sea slugs.  \\nGriffin:  You telling me there's bugs out there that‟s like, [sniffs]”Is that \\nChristmas time?” “No, it‟s just that ant.” \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  [laughs] I think pine odor, it‟s those combinations of terpenes that give \\nyou that smell.  \\nGriffin:  Okay.  \\nRachel:  But I haven‟t ever, you know, smelled a slug. I don‟t know, maybe it‟s \\npleasing.  \\nGriffin:  Hey folks, it‟s 2020. Smell a slug.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] You got a little time left to smell a slug.  \\nGriffin:  You got a little bit of time left to smell— wait, what?  \\nRachel:  l— \\nGriffin:  Cause in 2021, no more slugs? \\nRachel:  Well, if 2020 is the year you‟re gonna smell a slug, you‟ve only got a \\nfew weeks left, is what I‟m saying. \\nGriffin:  That‟s true. This year‟s been a real fuckin‟ shithole. May as well give \\nyourself one positive memory to go out on. Send 2020 out on a high note, go \\nsmell a big, fat, stinky slug and report back, please.  \\nRachel:  So, the reason we get that smell from the Christmas trees are that you \\ncan find a lot of terpenes in a conifer resin. So, when a tree‟s bark is damaged, \\nthe resin flows out, hardens and actually protects the tree. So, it‟s like when you \\nchop that boy down, he covers himself in this resin and smells real good.  \\nGriffin:  And he‟s like, “Ha ha ha, enjoy my stinky blood! And it‟s like, “Joke‟s on \\nyou, bro. I actually love the smell of your— the smell of your stinky blood is \\nbringing my family together.” \\n Rachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  “We are watching Home Alone 2: Lost in New York right now, and we \\nare enjoying it extra because of the smell of your stinky tree blood. Thank you.” \\nRachel:  [laughs] Um, the amazing thing about trees, especially these conifer \\ntrees, that I didn‟t realize, is that that smell is actually deterrent to bark beetles, \\nand also when it is released into the atmosphere it can play a role in cloud \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nseeding. So, some scientists think that the clouds that cover a conifer forest have \\nactually been created to block sunlight and cool the forest.  \\nGriffin:  That‟s wild! \\nRachel:  So, the trees release this compound and they get some shade.  \\nGriffin:  Man, I like that.  \\nRachel:  Isn‟t that nice? \\nGriffin:  That‟s cool! \\nRachel:  Mm hmm. There have been a lot of, like, claims about terpenes, too. \\nUh, they‟re used for a lot of purposes. They are used in turpentine, which is that \\nsolvent that thins out the paints.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, yeah.  \\nRachel:  They‟re also used in fragrances and cleaning products and in medicines. \\nThey have started to explore whether it could be a replacement for a petroleum-\\nbased chemical for things like plastic and fuel.  \\nGriffin:  Okay.  \\nRachel:  But the problem is that trees don‟t produce a lot of terpenes, so it‟s not \\nreally economically feasible.  \\nGriffin:  Just use more trees. We got a lot of them, right? \\nRachel:  [laughs] You kinda solve one problem by creating another with that one.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah. I watched FernGully. I think the message of that movie is there‟s \\nalways more trees? [laughs] Did I watch it right? \\nRachel:  Did I take that away? \\nGriffin:  I don‟t think so.  \\nRachel:  So yes, so pine, spruce and fir trees all produce these terpenes, and \\nthere is— there is also, apparently, some vitamin C in that pine bark and needles, \\ntoo. So, there‟s a lot of stuff going on there.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  I used to chew pine needles. I remember very clearly, they were like on \\ncampus at Marshall and there was a big one growing out right behind the theatre, \\nand so just like, green room breaks, you know, get back, hit up that tree on my \\nway out, grab a needle to chew on on my way home. It‟s nice. It was very rustic.  \\nRachel:  That does sound like some people have toothpicks and you‟re like, “Nah, \\nI‟m more earthy than that.” \\nGriffin:  I like it. Tasted good as hell.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah. Sometimes you‟d get a sappy one and they didn‟t taste especially \\ngood. I get why those beetles are like, “[chomping noise] Nope! Next tree. The \\npointy ones, guys, are gross.”  \\nCan I do my second thing? \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\nGriffin:  My second thing is a game called Settlers of Catan. Actually, these days \\nit‟s just called Catan. I think they dropped the „Settlers of‟. But the traditional title \\nwas the Settlers of Catan. Or maybe Catan [pronounced Kattan]. Again, \\ndepending on… but then you start thinking about Chris Kattan. And then you start \\nfucking laughing so hard that you can‟t focus. You think about Mango and it‟s like, \\n“Oh no, I lost control of my body.”  \\nGod, I miss playing Catan. Our friends here in town are not big, like, gamers, \\nespecially like board gamers, but for whatever reason, Catan, for a long period of \\ntime, was like the thing we did when we all got together.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, it surprised me, because I feel like we had a lot of games that I \\nthink were faster-paced and more accessible, but for whatever reason, Catan was \\nthe one that really took off.  \\nGriffin:  We would have game nights with like, me and some of my buddies, \\nwhere we would go over and just play one game of Catan. And that‟s it. That‟s \\nlike all we did. But for whatever reason, lie, everybody was so into it despite the \\nfact that they didn‟t really touch other board games. They just got really into \\nCatan.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  You know, I heard you can play that online. I wonder if that would be a \\nfun solution for our friends.  \\nGriffin:  Oh, that‟s not a bad idea, yeah. I think there‟s a board game version— \\nor like, an app that you can play. Anyway, I just sounded like I was 400,000 \\nyears old.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Catan is a German resource management board game where if you‟re \\nplaying the basic version, you and two to three other players sort of vie for \\ncontrol of an island that is made out of these little hex-shaped pieces. Apparently \\non the new version— traditionally you could pop the hexes in and out so every \\ntime you played it was like a different board, but I think the new versions of \\nCatan just have a static board that is like, designed for optimal fairness? Which is \\ninteresting. I dunno, I have to do more research into that.  \\nBasically, the different hexes have different resources on them and you build little \\ncities on those hexes to gather those resources and build more cities and roads \\nand things like that, to try and accomplish different objectives and collect victory \\npoints to win before your opponents.  \\nRachel:  Yeah, and there are all these different strategies that I witness people \\nuse. I don‟t particularly have a favorite. Do you have a favorite go-to? \\nGriffin:  I usually will try and be a little bit flexible for the first few rounds. So, to \\ngive you an example, you could get victory points for building towns and then you \\ncan get more victory points for upgrading them to cities, and then you get victory \\npoints on these little basically chance cards that you can spend resources on. And \\nyou can build roads— you have to build roads to connect your cities and then \\nwhoever has the longest road gets victory points, but you can try and steal that \\nfrom other people. So, like, I kind of watch what everybody else is doing, and \\nthen see, like, if there is a way for me to snake one of the things that nobody‟s \\ngoing for very easily.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  That is what is so brilliant about this game, right? I know what I said \\nearlier sounded complicated, but that‟s it. Like, there‟s a robber you move around \\nto screw people over. Like, there really isn‟t much to the game other than that, \\nand there are a million different ways that you can try and play it to win. And \\nbecause of the way that, like, you build your first cities, like, every time you play \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\neverybody‟s gonna have a different arrangement of like, “Okay, well this time I \\nhave a lot of access to sheep and ore. I haven‟t had that before, starting to play a \\ngame, what is that— what does my optimal way to victory look like?” \\nRachel:  Well, and it does become kind of a group game in a way, because at a \\ncertain point, if you realize somebody is poised to win, you can all kind of work \\ntogether.  \\nGriffin:  And that is what is so— the other sort of fascinating heat to the game is \\nthat in order to— realistically, in order to win, you have to trade. There‟s a part of \\nthe round for every player‟s turn where everybody can trade with that player. \\nAnd you have to do that, right? You are not going to be able to have a monopoly \\non every resource in the game, and you‟re gonna need something from somebody \\nat some point.  \\nSo, then it‟s a question of just like, “Well, I really need the thing that you are \\noffering me, but I also know that the thing I would give you in return would \\nperhaps win you the game,” so that social aspect is, like, kind of integral to the \\ngame and adds, like, a huge layer of complexity to it. Because now not only are \\nyou playing your game, you have to sort of mentally play everybody else‟s game \\ntoo, to make sure that you don‟t end your game by trading away the wrong thing.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  It‟s so, so, so, like… it gets at these primal board game concepts, and a \\nlot of them, too, without getting way too complicated about them. There are a lot \\nof different expansions to the game. The main one, I think, is 5 to 6 player \\nexpansion that makes it so you can play with more people. We typically play that \\nevery time we play. But then there‟s like, Seafarers and like, uh, what are the \\nother ones? Knights and Cities, and Traders and Barbarians. Like, there‟s all kinds \\nof different flavors that add things or add different sort of like campaigns and \\nscenarios.  \\nBut just the basic Catan is not that complicated. The rules aren‟t complicated, but \\nlike, the mental calculations you have to do while you are playing it and paying \\nattention to having, sort of, situational awareness is, like, super, super \\ncomplicated. There was a— the game was created by Klaus Teuber, who released \\nit in Germany in 1995, and it birthed sort of this huge wave of German \\nboardgames that went global. Like, this genre of game was, like, huge in \\nGermany, but it wasn‟t until Catan that it sort of had broad crossover appeal \\nwhen it reached the states and everywhere else and became, like, this huge, \\nhuge thing.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  Like Don‟t Break the Ice.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah, uh, Yeti in my Spaghetti.  \\nRachel:  Mhm. Jenga.  \\nGriffin:  Like, you know, these German classics. There‟s this prolific RPG designer \\nwhose name is Richard Dansky, who wrote about the game. And this quote, I \\nthink, really, really perfectly summarizes, like, what makes it so brilliant.  \\nHe wrote, “It‟s a resource management game defined by position and \\nstrategizing. It‟s a social game defined by horse trading of resource cards and \\n„siccing the Fritz‟, as my friends call the robber, with bloodthirsty bonhomie. It is \\na game of chance ruled by dice rolls and card draws. It‟s a hardcore game and a \\nlight social passtime and everything in between. A laboratory where I can test a \\nhundred different play styles, and a genuine reason to invite friends over.” Like, it \\nticks all the boxes of things that I like about playing board games.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  And it does it in a package that like— I think is pretty well tested at this \\npoint, at least locally, it works for everyone. Which is so rare. It‟s so rare.  \\nRachel:  Yeah. There‟s just enough luck involved that, you know, if you are \\nsomebody that hasn‟t won before, you know, it doesn‟t mean that you‟re never \\ngoing to win.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  And I feel like that‟s what can be really appealing when you have a \\ngroup of people who may or may not be board game enthusiasts. Is like, if you sit \\ndown with a bunch of people and you feel like, “Well, I‟m never gonna win,” you \\nknow, you‟re less likely to invest the time. But this one, I feel like— \\nGriffin:  I feel like everybody has won. We have played dozens and dozens and \\ndozens of games of Catan with our friends and I feel like everybody‟s won at least \\nonce.  \\nRachel:  Yeah.  \\nGriffin:  It is, uh— it‟s pretty— I mean, it‟s probably the perfect board game. \\n[laughs] I don‟t think you can do much better than it. And boy howdy— \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  Except for The Adventure Zone Game.  \\nGriffin:  The Adventure Zone Game, which, yeah.  \\nRachel:  Is perfect.  \\nGriffin:  Is really good. And God, I wish— I really wish I could memorize the URL \\nfor that.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  But it‟s on McElroy Family. I think.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  McElroyFamily.com, you can probably find the link there.  \\nRachel:  McElroy— no, McElroy.Family! \\nGriffin:  McElroy.Family. I think we have a few hyperlinks that‟ll get you there.  \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Here‟s some submissions from our friends at home. Catherine says, “My \\nwonderful thing is choosing the right kitchen tool to get the job done. My partner \\nand I recently expanded our kitchen tool collection and there‟s nothing more \\nsatisfying that having the right flexible plastic spatula to scrape the sides of a \\nbowl clean, or the proper sturdy metal spatula to get all the crispy bits off the \\nbottom of a pan.” \\nI forgot to tell you, that box right there does have a new set of wooden kitchen \\ninstruments that don‟t… add a crazy wood— \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Like, a crazy sandalwood smell to the food that we cook it with.  \\nRachel:  Okay.  \\nGriffin:  There‟s like, 13 wood tools in there. I‟m so stoked. God almighty, I love \\nwooden cooking tools.  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nRachel:  Okay. Uh, yeah, you know what, when you started reading that \\nsubmission I instantly thought of the spatula, because it‟s one of those tools that \\nI almost never use, and then when I remember we have it I‟m like, “Oh my gosh, \\nthis is the perfect thing!” \\nGriffin:  “This is it. This is what I need right now.” And Katie says, “Now that it‟s \\nactually chilly outside, one of my favorite things is going outside real quick \\nwithout a jacket, to take the trash out or grab something from my car, then \\ncoming back inside and feeling the very warm, cozy air.” \\nRachel:  Mm! \\nGriffin:  Mm, that‟s good too. Got cold here for a bit in Austin, it got warm again. \\nGonna get cold again soon, I guess. I had to run something outside and I was in \\nbare feet and I came back in the house like, “That sucked!” And I just sat by the \\nfireplace and was just like, “Ooh, that‟s good!” \\nRachel:  [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  Hey, thank you for listening! Thank you to bo en and Augustus for the \\nuse of our theme song “Money Won‟t Pay”. You can find a link to that in the \\nepisode description. And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network! \\nCheck out all the good shows on MaximumFun.org! \\nRachel:  Yeah, a lot of really good— a lot of really, really good stuff. I was \\nexcited actually, this week‟s Stop Podcasting Yourself has Rhea Butcher on it! \\nGriffin:  Oh! Great! \\nRachel:  Yeah. Like, the nicest people, all on one show.  \\nGriffin:  I do love that.  \\nRachel:  Um… and thank you all to be… hmm.  \\nGriffin:  Thank you all to be good.  \\nRachel:  Thank you all to be good. Thank you all for being patient with us as we \\nfigure out a recording schedule that will work for us. \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  Each week. [laughs]  \\n    \\n                                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\nGriffin:  It‟s, um… yeah.  \\nRachel:  I think what we are experiencing is what a lot of people are \\nexperiencing, which is you have a very careful card house built right now.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  And if one card comes lose, you realize you have nothing.  \\nGriffin:  Yeah.  \\nRachel:  And so, that is what we are figuring out.  \\nGriffin:  And then it‟s like— and then all of a sudden you end up president. And \\nthen, like, I guess you have a— your Chief of staff is a real bad guy.  \\nRachel:  Oh, House of Cards, I see. I see.  \\nGriffin:  And then… um… \\nRachel:  Yes.  \\nGriffin:  And then I guess you die? But you didn‟t see… \\nRachel:  You didn‟t see. [laughs]  \\nGriffin:  You didn‟t see me. I can‟t start fucking thinking about Kevin Spacey‟s \\nChristmas time video. I mean, we do watch it every year, because of just how \\nfucking… just how sad it is. But also how buck wild it is.  \\nRachel:  You gotta send that to Justin right now.  \\nGriffin:  I got to. We gotta go so I can send that to Justin. Bye everybody.  \\nRachel:  [laughs] Bye.  \\n[theme music plays]  \\nMaximumFun.org \\nComedy and culture. \\nArtist owned. \\nAudience supported. \\n \")"

I couldn\\'t remember the actual name of the dude who did \\nmy vasectomy— \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n   Justin:  —so I know there\\'s a dentist in town called Dr. Wild, and I just thought it \\nwas so funny to go to a dentist named Dr. Wild. That just seemed like, uh, kind of \\na stretch. You know, it\\'s funny. I\\'ve been thinking a lot about, um— \\n \\nSydnee:  When you had your vasectomy? \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. Um, fondly thinking back to it, \\'cause it\\'s the last time I was able \\nto sit for two days, and play v—and do nothing, um— \\n \\nSydnee:  Mm-hmm. \\n \\nJustin:  —with ice— \\n \\nSydnee:  With frozen peas. \\n \\nJustin:  —yeah, frozen peas on my... [quietly] genitals. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n \\nJustin:  Um, and I\\'ve been thinking back fondly to it. It was a very relaxing time \\nin my life. I could—now, the difference—I could\\'ve gone anywhere, which makes \\nit a lot nicer, but I didn\\'t, and that\\'s a key difference to where we\\'re at right now \\nin our lives. \\n \\nSydnee:  Right. I—I think what you were experiencing, maybe a lot of people are \\nexperiencing, although probably not longing for a surgical procedure that they\\'ve \\nhad in the past, perhaps. Perhaps remembering fondly a— \\n \\nJustin:  Not the procedure, the recovery.  \\n \\nSydnee:  —the recovery period— \\n \\nJustin:  Yes. \\n \\nSydnee:  —of a surgical procedure. Perhaps. You never know. Um, I never had \\nmy tonsils out, but I always remember everybody talking about how you got \\npopsicles afterward. \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs]  \\n   Sydnee:  So it seems like something you may remember fondly. Uh, would you \\nsay you\\'re experiencing some nostalgia? \\n \\nJustin:  That is more than fair, and not just about surgery recovery, Syd. I\\'ve \\nbeen experiencing a lot about a lot of things that I feel like I maybe didn\\'t \\nappreciate, uh, when I could do them. Uh— \\n \\nSydnee:  Leaving the house. \\n \\nJustin:  Le—yeah, that\\'s a great one. \\n \\nSydnee:  Going to the store, or the mall. \\n \\nJustin:  The mall—oh, don\\'t say the mall! \\n \\nSydnee:  The movies. Restaurants. [laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  The movies! Oh, I miss movies, Syd! I miss \\'em! \\n \\nSydnee:  Uh, being in crowds. I always, uh—I did not enjoy being in crowds, \\nuntil I couldn\\'t, and now [holding back laughter] I miss being in a crowd. \\n \\nJustin:  Can you imagine what that would be like? \\n \\nSydnee:  No. \\n \\nJustin:  It\\'s wild. It\\'s wild to think about. \\n \\nSydnee:  Uh, I got an email requesting that we talk about nostalgia, which I \\ndidn\\'t know had a history as an ailment, as a diagnosis, not just a feeling, uh, \\nuntil I received this email. And I was very—I am very grateful that I did, because \\nI find this fascinating. This is really... uh— \\n \\nJustin:  You\\'ve gotten into this one. I love it when Sydnee gets excited about a \\ntopic, um, especially when she reads a lot about it, \\'cause it means we get to, uh, \\nhave a lot of conversations about it, and I love to see you captivated. It\\'s one of \\nmy favorite Sydnee modes. \\n \\nSydnee:  Aww. Well, thank you. I\\'m reading a whole book about it now, which I\\'ll \\ntalk about.    \\nJustin:  A whole book?! \\n \\nSydnee:  A whole book about it! \\n \\nJustin:  No need to brag, Dr. McElroy! \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] Uh, and I also felt like it was timely. I think a lot of us are \\nprobably experiencing that longing... for a time... before. [crosstalk] \\n \\nJustin:  Oh yeah. Any other time, pretty much. \\n \\nSydnee:  Thank you—when I looked back, I realized several people have \\nrecommended this. Thank you Miranda, and Matt, and Britney, and Anna, and \\nLauren, and Jeremy, for emailing and mentioning this. I did not—like I said, I had \\nno idea of this history, of the concept of the word nostalgia. Um, and maybe you \\ndon\\'t either, so— \\n \\nJustin:  Safe bet. \\n \\nSydnee:  Yeah. \\n \\nJustin:  Safe bet, if you didn\\'t. \\n \\nSydnee:  The word itself— \\n \\nJustin:  Unless it had an article in Uncle John\\'s Bathroom Reader, I am not aware \\nof anything medical that you don\\'t know about. \\n \\n[pauses] \\n \\nSydnee:  Okay. You\\'re not aware of anything—no, that\\'s fair. Yes. That is true. \\n \\nJustin:  Unless...  \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n \\nJustin:  ... there was an article in Uncle John\\'s Bathroom Reader. One of the \\nmany volumes I\\'ve perused. \\n   Sydnee:  The word comes from the Greek. Uh, I knew the algia part from algos, \\nwhich is pain. Anything with an algia is hurting. A myalgia, your muscles are \\nhurting. An arthralgia, your joints are hurting. So, algia usually means pain, so \\nthat\\'s the algia part of nostalgia. \\n \\nUm, but I didn\\'t know the other part, nostos, coming—comes from the Greek for \\nhomecoming. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  So it\\'s an interesting concept. Homecoming pain, the pain of \\nhomecoming. Pain associated with homecoming. \\n \\nJustin:  [holding back laughter] I experienced that quite a few times in my high \\nschool years. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs]  \\n \\nJustin:  [amused] A lot of rejection, there! \\n \\nSydnee:  [through laughter] I believe I was one of those. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah! We don\\'t need to dwell on that. \\n \\nSydnee:  That\\'s a story for another—you\\'d broken my heart— \\n \\nJustin:  We don\\'t— \\n \\nSydnee:  —at church camp, and— \\n \\nJustin:  I just said—you said we didn\\'t need to dwell on it! \\n \\nSydnee:  Okay. Anyway, I think it\\'s interesting because, as—we\\'ll get into how \\nthis term came about, but it\\'s—it\\'s actually not a homecoming, right? It\\'s, like, a \\npsychological homecoming that you\\'re experiencing— \\n \\nJustin:  Right, you\\'re—you\\'re mentally going home, and that\\'s causing you pain. \\n   Sydnee:  Yes. But the origin of it comes a lot—is a lot more literal. The idea of \\npain because you can\\'t, because a homecoming is not occurring. You can\\'t go \\nhome. \\n \\nJustin:  Okay. \\n \\nSydnee:  So the term almost wasn\\'t. It\\'s really weird to think about, like, the \\nhistory of this word, because I think the idea of nostalgia means so much to us \\nnow. And I feel like especially as a kid of the 90\\'s, seeing, like, the fashion trends \\nand things of today, it feels very poignant to me, \\'cause I see a lot of people that \\nI\\'m like, \"You\\'re walkin\\' straight out of a Delia\\'s catalog from 1996 right now.\" \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs] I have friends like that I can enjoy and appreciate. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs quietly] But, uh, I don\\'t think—I don\\'t think Johannes Hofer \\nknew about Delia\\'s catalog either. Uh, he was a medical student in Basel, \\nSwitzerland in 1688. He was studying a mere 17 miles from his hometown of \\nMulhouse, uh, but 17 miles was a lot harder to travel back then, I guess. \\n \\nJustin:  Sure, yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  You know. Like— \\n \\nJustin:  What are you gonna do? \\n \\nSydnee:  —no cars.  \\n \\nJustin:  Get a horse? No thanks. \\n \\nSydnee:  Well, yeah, I mean, I think...  \\n \\nJustin:  They\\'re expensive. \\n \\nSydnee:  ... like, a horse. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  Or a buggy, probably. \\n   Justin:  They were probably lying all over the place, though, horses back then. \\nProbably not as hard to come by. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs quietly] He had previously read in theology and philosophy in \\nuniversity, but he had decided to pursue medicine as his career, and that\\'s where \\nhe went to medical school. Um, and at the time, it was required that medical \\nstudents present sort of a preliminary dissertation about some sort of disease \\nstate or treatment, and then you would have to, like—you would write your paper \\ndescribing it, and then present it to a panel of physicians and defend, like a \\ndissertation, right? Um, and typically you would choose something that was \\nknown. Like, \"I\\'m just going to do a deep dive into this already well described and \\nunderstood condition.\" Or, well, [holding back laughter] we thought we \\nunderstood it at the time. \"And then I\\'m gonna present it, and they\\'re gonna ask \\nme some questions that—just to prove that I know about it, and that will be the \\nwhole thing.\" \\n \\nThat was kind of the idea. Uh, and these were called disputatios. What he \\npresented was called a dissertatio, which was a whole new idea. The idea, \"As a \\nmedical student, I\\'m going to present to you a whole new disease that I have \\nnamed myself.\" \\n \\nJustin:  That\\'s a pretty big swing, I feel like. \\n \\nSydnee:  It is a big swing! It\\'s—it is! It\\'s a—I mean, if you can imagine, if you \\nare in medical training, doing that right now, like, \"Hello. Hello, doctors. I came \\nup with a disease. [laughs quietly] And I\\'m going to tell you about it now.\" \\n \\nThat\\'d be wild. Uh, he—now, the idea that there was this illness that had not yet \\nbeen named was already out there. Obviously he didn\\'t, you know— \\n \\nJustin:  Invent the idea. \\n \\nSydnee:  Right. Um, there was the idea of heimweh, or homesickness, or what \\nthe French called la maladie du pays, which was a disease state. The idea that \\nyou could get so homesick that you were sick, literally sick. Not just, like, \"I miss \\nhome.\" Like, \"I\\'m in bed, I have a fever. I—\" \\n \\nJustin:  Like broken heart syndrome, the idea that you could be— \\n \\nSydnee:  Yes.    \\nJustin:  —you experience something emotionally so much that it would cause \\nphysical symptoms.  \\n \\nSydnee:  Although at that point you have to understand, the idea of, like... how \\nthe mind connects to the body and, um, not just the emotional part of that, but \\nthe actual, like, chemical, you know, neurotransmitters and things—none of that \\nwas understood, right? \\n \\nJustin:  No, we had no—we had no idea. \\n \\nSydnee:  We had no—right. This was all before those concepts. Um, he, uh—he \\nwas also inspired by stories of, like, soldiers, or servants, who would commonly \\nbe sent from their home—you know, hometown, maybe their little village, to go \\nwork in, like, a rich person\\'s house in a city or something, and so be very far \\naway from home, and probably not—you know, if you\\'re a soldier, you can\\'t go \\nhome until you\\'re given the order to. And if you were one of these servants, you \\nwere not allowed to. Maybe never! \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  Depending on what the—you know, what you were contracted or \\nwhatever to do. \\n \\nUm, and these people would be removed from their native lands, and then would \\nget very, very sick, and until they were kind of repatriated, put back home, they—\\nsome of them would die. That\\'s how severe this illness was. \\n \\nAnd so he wanted to describe that. What was that? \\n \\nJustin:  It\\'s also probably, I would imagine at this point, like, more... like, brutal. \\nBecause you didn\\'t spend time away from where you were. Like, these days, you \\nknow, we have planes and cars and what have you, so you would—you know, it \\nwasn\\'t—it\\'s not uncommon, I think, for people to travel far away from their home \\nfor periods of time. It must be very—much more jarring if you\\'re lived your entire \\nexistence in one place to find yourself, you know, halfway across the world. \\n \\nSydnee:  You see a lot of this—and I—I was gonna get into this a little later, but I \\nthink it\\'s good to bring it up now. What you\\'re talking about is one of the reasons \\nwhy they thought initially the people who got this illness got it. This concept that,   especially people in rural communities or mountainous areas, grow up sort of \\nisolated, and only know their families, the people immediately around them. And \\nso when you take them away from home, they feel that a lot more intensely than \\npeople who grew up in cities, who maybe are used to the idea that you leave your \\nfamilies at some point. It is just normal. Like, \"I will move away and I\\'ll—you \\nknow, we\\'ll write letters or whatever, but this is just not—it\\'s normal.\" \\n \\nUm, and you can see as this idea of this as an illness is more and more \\nunderstood, that kind of argument. Like, \"Well, it\\'s just these rural mountain \\npeople who get it.\" \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, which I felt—I feel like is very interesting, because I see echoes of \\nthat in the way we talk about West Virginians today, and probably other regions \\nof Appalachia. \\n \\nJustin:  How so? \\n \\nSydnee:  The idea that people always come back. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  You\\'ve heard this, I\\'m sure. West Virginians, they always end up \\ncoming back home at some point. They might move away, but they come back \\nhome. I\\'ve heard that concept. I have no idea if that\\'s true. I don\\'t know of any \\nevidence for that. But you\\'ll hear that idea that, like, \"Well, people from these \\nmountainous areas feel that pull to go back home.\" \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs quietly] \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, and it\\'s weird, \\'cause you gotta wonder if there aren\\'t, like, \\ncultural... you know, that this is kind of reverberating throughout time, this idea. \\nBut anyway, uh, he tried out different ideas for how he would name this. Um, \\neventually he tried—er, initially he tried nosomania, which means return \\nmadness— \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs] That\\'s a little much. That\\'s a little intense, I feel. \\n   Sydnee:  He tried philopatridomania, which is literally madness caused by \\nyearning for the homeland. \\n \\nJustin:  Little verbose. \\n \\nSydnee:  But nostalgia was the one that he liked the best. It was the one that \\nstuck. And it makes sense, it sounds nice. \\n \\nJustin:  It\\'s a nice sounding word, yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  He also wanted to separate it from a mania, because a mania at that \\npoint was a clinical entity that seemed a lot less—you couldn\\'t understand it, and \\nyou didn\\'t quite know what to do about it at that point, all the different things \\nthey called a mania, \\'cause there were lots of different things that are not what \\nwe would describe today as, like, a diagnosed manic state that would fall under \\nthe heading at this point of mania. And he wanted something that you could fix. \\n \\nJustin:  Okay. \\n \\nSydnee:  And nostalgia was known to be fixable, as we\\'ll get into. So he \\npresented his paper with his definition, his name, his treatments, his case studies, \\nthe physiology of it, whatever. He defended it. His mentors, Jacob Harder and \\nTheodor Zwinger, both thought he did a great idea, and the took—er, did a great \\njob, and thought this idea was so important that they took an unusual step. They \\npublished it. \\n \\nThis would\\'ve—this was not done for a preliminary medical student dissertation. \\n \\nJustin:  Sure. \\n \\nSydnee:  This was not typical. \\n \\nJustin:  So, my first research project. \\n \\nSydnee:  Exactly. The fact that this was published was very strange. Um, and \\nZwinger would go further later, when he published a collection of important \\npapers. He included this in there. And it is fair to say that both these other guys \\nwould kind of take credit for this at different times. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm.    \\nSydnee:  Um, but I guess at this point in history, that was not uncommon. \\nThings were kind of generated from, like, a student and a professor collectively, \\nand it was not unusual for a professor to maybe take credit for a student\\'s work, \\nand things, as to exactly who wrote what was always sort of nebulous. So that—\\nthese are not bad guys. This was the time. \\n \\nUm, the symptoms that Hofer laid out were very varied. Some had what you \\nwould expect. Sadness, obsessive thoughts about their homeland, anxiety, \\ninsomnia, weakness, loss of appetite, those kinds of things, right? Things we \\nwould expect with someone who—uh, what we would probably call depression, \\nright? Um, others would progress to things like fevers, or breathing problems. \\nSome might have clotting issues, or— \\n \\nJustin:  Really? Wow. \\n \\nSydnee:  —brain inflammation, rashes, bleeding, irregular heart rhythms. \\n \\nJustin:  This seems like a lot. \\n \\nSydnee:  Things that we probably would not call nostalgia now, right? \\n \\nJustin:  Mm-hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  So you can see where this idea of nostalgia encompassed... a longing \\nfor home, probably psychiatric diagnoses of things like depression and anxiety, \\nand then also some other... uh, illnesses, that were just kind of thrown in there. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, but if they happened in somebody who was missing home, they \\ncalled it nostalgia. \\n \\nJustin:  Huh. \\n \\nSydnee:  His theory—Hofer lays out as to why this happens. What is going on in \\nthe human body? Because this was very much— \\n \\nJustin:  Physically speaking, you mean. \\n   Sydnee:  Yes. What is—what is the physiology of this? Because this is as \\nmedicine is moving away from the humors, and moving in to this sort of, like, \\nmechanistic view of the human body. So this was at a—this moment in history is \\na transition point in our understanding of what\\'s happening. \\n \\nSo it would be typical for you to try to explain... on, like, a microscopic level, \\nwhat is happening in the brain when this happens. He believed that our animal \\nspirits... our anima, our soul, if you will—animal spirits is what they would\\'ve \\ncalled this, and this was not a spiritual concept, but this is—but, I mean—and \\nthere\\'s a lot of overlap there. Whatever we\\'re talking about, these animal spirits, \\nwere walking along the white tubules in our brains, and would get stuck in the \\noval center, which is where our memories are. \\n \\nJustin:  In the oval center? \\n \\nSydnee:  These were the names that—anyway, so, in the oval— \\n \\nJustin:  I like that, it\\'s accessible. \\n \\nSydnee:  —[laughs] in the oval center of our brain, where our memories— \\n \\nJustin:  [simultaneously] The delicious candy yolk. \\n \\nSydnee:  —[laughs] where our memories of our home and times gone by all live, \\nthe animal spirits would be wandering down those tubules. They\\'d kinda get stuck \\nthere on one specific memory of our home, typically. This was very much \\nassociated with, like, your home, your homeland, your home... town, your house, \\nyour—you know, your home. \\n \\nAnd they would get stuck there, and kind of clogged up, and they would excite \\nthat one region, over and over and over again, just that one, until, like, as you—\\nas you can kind of envision, you\\'re focused on it. You\\'re hyperfocused on it. \\nYou\\'re obsessed with it. And what would result from that, your imagination would \\nbe stimulated. And you would begin to visualize and, like, vividly imagine this \\nmemory, that these animal spirits in your brain are stuck on. \\n \\nJustin:  You know, I was ready to get all smug when, uh, it was—you said, \\n\"We\\'re moving away from humeral medicine into a more mechanistic view.\" I was \\nlike, \"That\\'s right! Here we go, real science! Show them how it\\'s done!\" \\n   I did not expect you to be like, \"So anyway, we got a brain yolk, and there\\'s a \\nbunch of, uh, tiny brain dogs, and they latch on to a memory, and they clog up \\nyour brain pipes. You know, just basic science.\" [snorts] \\n \\nSydnee:  I think it\\'s beautiful. I—I\\'m not— \\n \\nJustin:  It\\'s beautiful, it\\'s just, like, I\\'m not sure how—how much we\\'ve improved \\nover the humeral system with this particular—at this particular point. \\n \\nSydnee:  I think it\\'s so evocative! The idea that your—I mean, and this is at a \\ntime where things like passions and imagination were, um, dangerous ideas. \\nBecause they led people to behave in ways that weren\\'t orderly, and to think in \\nways that weren\\'t orderly. And so when you say it stimulates the imagination, \\nthat\\'s not like, \"[cheery voice] Imagination!\" \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs] \\n \\nSydnee:  It\\'s like, \"Uh-oh. Now we\\'re in trouble.\" So these were very serious \\nideas that were being communicated, and I know it seems silly, but it\\'s kind of a \\nbeautiful way of imagining nostalgia. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  Your passions get focused on something that you remember, until you \\ncan visualize it. You see it, you\\'re experiencing it, and feeling it so strongly, but \\nyou can\\'t have it, and so the longing becomes so intense. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, this was his idea. But anyway, because of this it blocks the flow of \\nthese spirits throughout the body, through what was known at the time as the \\ncommon sensorium, which is what was thought to connect your mind and your \\nbody. Um, because all the animal spirits get clogged up in your brain. \\n \\nJustin:  Sure, right, yes. \\n \\nSydnee:  So the rest of your body suffers. So your blood becomes thick and clots, \\nyour phlegm becomes too thick, breathing problems— \\n \\nJustin:  From the dog—from the tiny spirit animals.    \\nSydnee:  Well, no, because they\\'re not there. They\\'re up in your brain. \\n \\nJustin:  Oh, right, okay. \\n \\nSydnee:  They\\'re stuck up in your brain. \\n \\nJustin:  And normally they would be— \\n \\nSydnee:  All over. \\n \\nJustin:  —thinning out your blood and mucus, okay. \\n \\nSydnee:  Mm-hmm, thinning those things out. Your gastric juices are diluted of \\nall the things they need, and so you—that\\'s why you don\\'t have an appetite, \\n\\'cause you can\\'t digest food, because nothin\\'s workin\\' properly. \\n \\nJustin:  \\'Cause the tummy dogs aren\\'t there. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs quietly] In terms of treatments, what he proposed was the \\nusual stuff first. Some mercury— \\n \\nJustin:  Sure. \\n \\nSydnee:  —maybe some wine, uh, try this thing that might make you puke, a \\nvariety of tonics for things like fevers, or a heart tonic, things like that. If all else \\nfails, bleed \\'em. Right? \\n \\nJustin:  Bleed \\'em! \\n \\nSydnee:  Bleeding was always recommended. Um, and all the while, while you\\'re \\ndoing this, distract them. Try to get them to focus on now, and here, and where \\nthey are. Don\\'t—Tell them, \"Well, you gotta forget about home. You gotta—you \\ncan\\'t think about that place anymore. That\\'s gone. That\\'s over.\" \\n \\nJustin:  Wow, yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, but there was only one cure. And that was the nice thing about \\nthis, and why I think you could theorize he would wanna present it, is that there \\nwas a surefire cure to nostalgia. Send \\'em—send \\'em home.    \\nJustin:  Go home. \\n \\nSydnee:  Just send \\'em home. And that\\'s what he says. At the end of the day, \\nwherever your patient is in the world, no matter how sick they are, if you have to \\nput \\'em on a stretcher, get them home, and they will always, 100% of the time, \\nbe cured of their illness. \\n \\nUm, what\\'s weird about it is that—so, he puts this out there into the world, \\ncreates this word, \"nostalgia,\" this idea, \"nostalgia,\" like, solidifies it as a concept. \\nHe finishes his medical studies. His final dissertation, like, his big work, by the \\nway, was about uterine dropsy, which was... the uterus filling with fluid and \\nbecoming inflamed. Anyway, nothing to do with nostalgia, is my point. \\n \\nSo, he goes on to never write about, or talk about, or lecture about nostalgia \\nagain. He goes back to his hometown. He becomes a doctor. Um, I thought you \\nwould appreciate this. He later decides to leave his medical career for public \\nservice. He becomes [holding back laughter] Burgermeister.  \\n \\nJustin:  [whispering] What?! \\n \\nSydnee:  It\\'s like—the head of the town council was called the Burgermeister. \\n \\nJustin:  Aww, dang it! I cooked up a list in my head of, like, ten different things \\nBurgermeister could be, and that\\'s, like, the—not even in the top 100 coolest. \\n \\nSydnee:  So he was the Burgermeister, and then he ascended to— \\n \\nJustin:  [bursts into laughter] Can I be Burgermeister? \\n \\nSydnee:  You can be the Burgermeister of our house. \\n \\nJustin:  Yes! \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, he ascended to other levels of public service, and spent the rest of \\nhis life—and, I mean, he did important work in his town, but he never addressed \\nnostalgia again! He just, like, threw this idea out into the ether, and then went \\nback to his life. \\n \\nJustin:  And then—    \\nSydnee:  And then, of course, we\\'ve never heard of nostalgia since then. \\n \\nJustin:  Uh, no. That\\'s not actually what happened, Sydnee. \\n \\nSydnee:  No. I\\'ll tell you what happens next, but first, we gotta go to the billing \\ndepartment. \\n \\nJustin:  Let\\'s go! \\n \\n[theme music plays] \\n \\n***** \\n \\n[ad break] \\n \\n***** \\n \\nJustin:  So, nostalgia has been, uh—is runnin\\' wild, is set free. The idea has been \\nunleashed on an unsuspecting populace. \\n \\nSydnee:  It\\'s interesting. The power of, um, language, and using—if you want to \\npersuade people, if you want to convince people, make sure the words you pick \\nsound nice, is really illustrated here. \\n \\nJustin:  And having a word for it. \\n \\nSydnee:  Yes. \\n \\nJustin:  Like, it really does condense the—there\\'s a lot of ideas that I think it \\nwould be easier to communicate if we had words for them. Do you know the one I \\nwas thinking about yesterday? I wish there was a word for, \"I know it looks like \\nmy hands are really full and I need help, but if I let any of these things go, I\\'m \\ngoing to drop them all, so please just let me go to where I need to go.\" \\n \\nImagine we had one word for that very complicated concept— \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n   Justin:  —that we need to communicate to people—for me, like, on a weekly \\nbasis. Like, I know it looks like I\\'m carrying a lot of things and I need help, but if \\nI let one of these things go I\\'m gonna drop \\'em all, so please let me go on to \\nwhere I need to go. Give me one word for that, please. \\n \\nSydnee:  Well, I mean, that\\'s on—come up with it. Make it. \\n \\nJustin:  Well, I don\\'t have that kind of power. Maybe if it was a hashtag. \\n \\nSydnee:  I don\\'t know if Dr. Hofer did, but he thought he did, and he did it. So...  \\n \\nJustin:  I guess that\\'s true. Maybe I should just believe in myself. \\n \\nSydnee:  I\\'ll give you a magic feather later. \\n \\nJustin:  The problem I\\'ve always had is confidence. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] [through laughter] I don\\'t think that\\'s true. \\n \\nJustin:  As a cis white man, I have always struggled with confidence. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] Anyway, nostalgia was out there. And it\\'s funny, because there \\nwere further publications of his paper, like in collections and things, where \\nauthors would try to change it to other words. They would change the word \\n\"nostalgia\" to other terms, but nostalgia kept coming back. That was the one that \\nstuck. And it does sound nice, especially compared to the other ones we\\'ve talked \\nabout. It was a nice-sounding thing. \\n \\nIt\\'s weird, \\'cause you really—what you talked about, why didn\\'t he just write \\nabout a subset of melancholy? Melancholy was a well known diagnosis at the time, \\nwhich, again, similar to depression today, but kind of a more nebulous idea. But, \\nuh, you know, this could\\'ve been looked at as a subset of melancholy. A lot of the \\nsymptoms were very similar. Other than returning home, the treatments were \\npretty similar. Um, although with melancholy, you usually told people to travel. \\n[laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs] \\n \\nSydnee:  What you need is a good travel. That\\'ll make you feel better. \\n   Justin:  Shake it up. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, the idea was really important for a few different reasons. Like I \\nsaid, this was a time where we were shifting in our understanding of disease and \\nwhat caused it, away from the humors. Uh, we\\'ve talked about before ontology, \\nthe idea that we need to classify, like, in taxonomies, all of—this was the era of \\nthat. We\\'re moving into the time where people sat down and just made big trees \\nof medical diagnoses. This is part of this tree, and this is a subset of this \\ndiagnosis, and all that kind of thing, to try to classify everything that could go \\nwrong in the human body. \\n \\nUm, our—like I said, our concept of emotion and passion and all this was \\nchanging. Is it good or is it bad? Um, if you have these kinds of problems, are \\nyou a weak person? That was initially thought. Like, if you were prone to \\nnostalgia, are you—is there something wrong with you? You\\'re weak? \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, and there\\'s something wrong with, like, the way that you think \\nand feel, your emotions are bad. Or moving into, as the years pass, this idea of \\nsensibility as being a good thing. Someone who was able to cry, and experience \\nemotion and passion, was thought to be more in touch with their pure self, more \\nin touch with nature. Um, again, there\\'s this tie to, like, people who live in rural \\nareas are able to cry like this because they have been—they haven\\'t been, like, \\ndiluted by city life yet. \\n \\nJustin:  Right, right. Untouched. Like myself! \\n \\nSydnee:  Yeah, this kind of, like, longing for nature and connection. That idea \\nwas big at the time, and nostalgia spoke to all of this, you know? And so I think it \\nreally captured a lot of people\\'s imaginations as, like, \"Oh, maybe this explains it. \\nMaybe this is the key. This is the thing we have not been able to figure out, and \\nas our world is changing so rapidly, this is why we\\'re not adapting. If I don\\'t feel \\ngood, I have an answer now.\" \\n \\nUm, and soldiers got it a lot. It\\'s interesting, Hofer didn\\'t write about soldiers at \\nall in his dissertation, which is a weird thing to leave out. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah, it\\'s almost like a built-in control group, almost, that you would \\nhave. You know what I mean?    \\nSydnee:  And it was—it was known to occur most commonly among soldiers, \\nspecifically Swiss soldiers, which may be why Hofer didn\\'t mention it, is because \\nthe Swiss soldiers did not like this connotation. \\'Cause when this idea was first \\nintroduced, it would have insinuated, like, our soldiers aren\\'t very good, [holding \\nback laughter] because they get homesick, and they get nostalgia, and then you \\nhave to send them home. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  So you wouldn\\'t—it\\'s kind of like you\\'re undermining your military \\nmight by putting out this idea that, like, \"Hey, you know what a lot of our soldiers \\nget? A debilitating illness that will necessitate you to send them home!\" \\n \\nThis was also a time where Swiss mercenary soldiers were very commonly rented \\nout by other nations, you know, to be used in their wars. Especially France, but \\nother countries as well. Swiss soldiers were sent all over the place, \\'cause they \\nwere known to be, you know, an elite fighting force. So, Hofer doesn\\'t talk about \\nsoldiers, but they were by far the most common patients to get nostalgia. \\n \\nUm, and—and to the extent where there was this story that was passed around \\nthat there was a certain song you could not play around Swiss soldiers. There are, \\num— \\n \\nJustin:  \"Who Let the Dogs Out\"? \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] No. There are, uh, sheepherder songs, simple melodies that \\nwould be played out in the fields to call the sheep back in, and that if you played \\nthese songs around a Swiss soldier, they would just dissolve into tears and, like, \\nbe unable to function, and you would end up having to send them home. \\n \\nUm, the—they were called ranz—ranz de vaches is what they\\'re called, these \\nsongs. You\\'ve heard one. Um— \\n \\nJustin:  Is it \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\"? \\n \\nSydnee:  Do you know—it\\'s the—it\\'s—[laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"? \\n   Sydnee:  It\\'s the flute solo in the third section of the Overture to Rossini\\'s \\nWilliam Tell. [hums briefly] [laughs quietly]  \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah, oh, okay. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] Just click, and we can play it here. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah, uh, okay. I\\'ll—I\\'ll just do that for you, Syd! \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs quietly]  \\n \\n[flute solo from the William Tell Overture plays] \\n \\nJustin:  Ohhh, okay, yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  That. And if they would hear it they would dissolve into tears, because \\nit would remind them so strongly of their homeland. \\n \\nJustin:  I have that for, \"[singing] Nick nick nick na nick nick nick, Nickelodeon!\" \\nSo I get it. That makes me very nostalgic for my youth. \\n \\nSydnee:  It\\'s like when a West Virginian hears \"Country Roads.\" \\n \\nJustin:  No. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs]  \\n \\nJustin:  No. It\\'s not like that. We get a—we get a bellyfull of that. [laughs]  \\n \\nSydnee:  Uh... as the—now, as the wars continued throughout that century, you \\nwould see nostalgia diagnosed among soldiers from all countries, so it less and \\nless became associated with the Swiss, to the great relief, I\\'m sure, of the Swiss \\npeople. \\n \\nJustin:  [simultaneously] Of the Swiss. \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] Um— \\n \\nJustin:  Our thing is chocolate and knives, and we don\\'t need to talk about \\nnostalgia any more.    \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n \\nJustin:  And the clocks, yes. Okay, fine. Chocolate, knives, and clocks. That\\'s us. \\nAnd the cheese! The hole-y cheese, you guys love that! There\\'s lots to offer. \\nForget about our [through laughter] debilitating homesickness! \\n \\nSydnee:  Uh, it was the only thing you could be sent home for in some armies, \\nparticularly in France. Uh, that was the one thing, like, that you just had to \\ndischarge the soldier and let them go back home, at least for a temporary leave. \\nUh, because there was no other cure, and it would be completely debilitating to \\nthe military force if you left them there. \\n \\nJustin:  Think about how much easier things would\\'ve been on Klinger if that had \\nbeen the case. He could\\'ve just walked around—instead of, you know, trying to \\nget discharged for mental illness, he could\\'ve just walked around like, \"I miss my \\ndad! I really miss my dad!\" \\n \\nSydnee:  You know, he talks about home so much. Like, they order ribs from his \\nhometown at one point, \\'cause he misses them so much. \\n \\nJustin:  I\\'m sayin\\', this time period, he would\\'ve been fine. \\n \\nSydnee:  In the Civil War time period, or in the times of these—the Napoleonic \\nWars, he could\\'ve been diagnosed with nostalgia and sent home. \\n \\nJustin:  We should do a fanfic— \\n \\nSydnee:  [laughs] \\n \\nJustin:  —ep of M*A*S*H where we, like—he digs out this obscure and he\\'s, like, \\ntrying to employ it. That\\'d be a good ep. \\n \\nSydnee:  Mm-hmm. \\n \\nJustin:  And then the other characters do... doctor stuff. \\n \\nSydnee:  It was not uncommon. If you look at, like, discharge papers from the \\ntime, nostalgia was a diagnosis, um, that was given. And, uh, there were other   cures, of course. Especially because of the military connection, you would see \\nthings like, \"Just bully them out of it.\" \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, unfortunately. Especially as we move into, like—this was common \\nin the Civil War in the United States, too, and the idea that you would shame \\nthem or bully them until they— \\n \\nJustin:  You\\'d be homesick for your half of the country [holding back laughter] \\nthat you\\'re not in anymore. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, there were also ideas about altitude. There was this—for a while, \\npeople thought, well, since it mainly happened among Swiss people, maybe it\\'s \\nbecause they\\'re used to being up in the mountains, and now they\\'re at these \\nlower altitudes. So what we need to do is put them in a tower. So they would, like, \\ntry to take them up to a high building. \\n \\nJustin:  [simultaneously] Store them in a tower, perfect. \\n \\nSydnee:  That didn\\'t work. \\n \\nJustin:  Probably not a high building. [wheeze-laughs] At this time period, I \\nwould imagine. \\n \\nSydnee:  Well, as high as they had. \\n \\nJustin:  Right.  \\n \\nSydnee:  Uh, people tried, like— \\n \\nJustin:  \"It\\'s three stories! What do you want?! Why don\\'t you feel better? You\\'re \\n30 feet off the ground like an eagle!\" \\n \\nSydnee:  They tried to, like, give them dairy products, \\'cause they thought it had \\nsomething to do with hardy mountain breakfasts. [laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  Sure, granola, grape nuts. \\n   Sydnee:  Um, but none of that stuff helped. Uh, and this was a huge point of \\ncontention in the military, because doctors would be saying, \"Listen, they have \\nnostalgia, we gotta send them home, there\\'s nothing we can do.\" \\n \\nAnd a lot of the military officials were like, \"You\\'re depleting our forces. You can\\'t \\ndo this!\" \\n \\nSo, hence the shaming, the bullying. There was one commander who was \\nrumored to bury soldiers alive... if they suffered from nostalgia. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  As a threat to everybody else, basically. \"This is what happens if you—if \\nyou have this.\" \\n \\nJustin:  How we’re curing your nostalgia. \\n \\nSydnee:  Yeah. So—but a lot of doctors, you\\'ll see—a lot of soldiers did get sent \\nhome for this reason. Um, as—there were a lot of associations with nostalgia and \\ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis we\\'ve talked about on talked about on the show before, \\nwas a romantic disease for a while. It was thought a very poetic, beautiful way \\nto...  \\n \\nJustin:  Beef it. \\n \\nSydnee:  ... go. [laughs quietly] Um, and lovesickness, homesickness, \\nnostalgia—all this. If you were a truly sensible person, if you were really in touch \\nand able to experience real emotion, these were acceptable ways to go. Nostalgia \\ngot tied in, and there were probably people who had TB who were diagnosed with \\nnostalgia. \\n \\nJustin:  Being nostalgic for not having TB. \\n \\nSydnee:  I would think. \\n \\nJustin:  I would imagine. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, and there were other ideas. That it come from, like I said, the \\nmountains, from certain foods. People thought maybe it comes from masturbation, \\nso you shouldn\\'t do that. There was an idea for a while—doctors looked for a   certain bone in your body that caused nostalgia, and they were never able to find \\nthe nostalgia bone. Um, but—so, too, changed over time our understanding of \\nnostalgia as an illness as opposed to a benign emotion. And so that\\'s—that was, \\nlike, the first step. You saw doctors begin to separate it out as to, like, \"Well, \\nmaybe there are people who are sick from nostalgia.\" Or, as we would eventually \\nlearn, from many other diagnoses. \"But there are also just people experiencing \\nnostalgia. It\\'s just a benign thing. It\\'s just a feeling, and it\\'s okay.\" \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  \"And it\\'s not a sickness.\" And from that split, nostalgia became more \\nand more associated, the word, with a normal, global emotion that we feel from \\ntime to time, and not an illness. \\n \\nJustin:  I think it\\'s interesting that at some point we made the juxtaposition from \\nit being based on a location to being based on time. \\n \\nSydnee:  Mm-hmm. \\n \\nJustin:  I mean, at some point—right? They were in no way, at this point, talking \\nabout... the past—longing for the past, right? You\\'re longing for your homeland, a \\nplace where you lived, where I think we commonly use it to refer to, like, a time \\nperiod that we cannot return to. \\n \\nSydnee:  Well, and I think that was— \\n \\nJustin:  Which is interesting, because that\\'s the kind of nostalgia that, going by \\nthis, has no cure. You can\\'t cure that. \\n \\nSydnee:  Exactly—well, and they would argue is not an illness, either.  \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  And that was—as we began to move away from this disease concept of \\nnostalgia, the word \"nostalgia\" began to encompass these other ideas, like you \\nsaid. Not just a place, but a whole... a time, a state of being, like childhood. You \\nknow, people that were with you or things you felt or smelled or tasted in those \\nmoments. All those things nostalgia became associated with, once it was \\ndisconnected from disease. It was also, like you said, disconnected from location. \\n   Um, and there were also, like, political implications that came with this as well. \\nPeople thought nostalgia was longing for—you\\'ll hear this language today, right? A \\nsimpler time, a gentler time. \\n \\nJustin:  Sure, right. \\n \\nSydnee:  These sort of, like—what were associated with conservative ideas, \\nwhereas progressives were not nostalgic, because they were future-looking, you \\nknow, moving forward. \\n \\nUm, the weirdest part—\\'cause I think we\\'ve come to a point now where we \\nunderstand nostalgia as a distinct emotion that you experience and feel, and is \\nnot necessarily connected to a location, or a nationality, or a political leaning. \\n[laughs quietly] It is just a feeling that we all have. \\n \\nHere\\'s the weird part. Not only do we now know it\\'s not a disease, we now \\nbelieve it might be good for you, perhaps. Maybe. There are researchers all over \\nthe world—there are researchers in Japan, in England, they\\'re a couple places in \\nthe US—where they\\'ve studied the effects of nostalgia on the human brain. \\n \\nAnd what they have found from these different studies is that it seems like \\nactivating the memory center of your brain with one of these specific nostalgic \\nmemories, not just any memory—not just like, \"Do you remember earlier today \\nwhen you were in the bathroom?\" [laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  Right. \\n \\nSydnee:  A memory that would\\'ve— \\n \\nJustin:  And I do, yes, fondly. \\n \\nSydnee:  Are you nostalgic for it? [laughs quietly] \\n \\nJustin:  In a way, yes. \\n \\nSydnee:  So, a memory like that. Like when you were in the bathroom earlier \\nand you\\'re feeling nostalgic for that moment. It also—not only when you \\nexperience that memory are you activating that part of your brain, you\\'re \\nactivating dopamine in your brain. Pleasure centers. You\\'re releasing these feel-  good chemicals that bring you pleasure and joy from experiencing nostalgia. So \\nyou get mood enhancement from experiencing nostalgia. \\n \\nJustin:  It\\'s like a pain that... feels good. \\n \\nSydnee:  Yes \\n \\nJustin:  Like a good feeling [unintelligible] \\n \\nSydnee:  Like a positive longing. Um, beyond that, there was another study who \\nsaid people who experience nostalgia more often tend to be more empathetic. \\nThey tend to socialize more. They tend to find more meaning in life than people \\nwho don\\'t experience nostalgia very often. And there was even a study suggested \\nthat cold weather tends to trigger more nostalgia, which I thought was very \\ninteresting, \\'cause I would say that\\'s—anecdotally, I would say I—I have \\nexperienced that, you know? And I always assumed it was connected with, like—\\nfor us, cold weather also equals certain holidays, and perhaps that was why. \\n \\nJustin:  I get it more in summer. I think about, like, backdoor—like, backyard, \\nuh— \\n \\nSydnee:  That\\'s interesting. \\n \\nJustin:  —backyard, like, barbecues, and playing outside, stuff like that. \\n \\nSydnee:  There is—they\\'ve seen some ideas that perhaps it is connected with \\ncold weather, and that nostalgia can make you remember times when you were \\nwarm. \\n \\nJustin:  Hmm. \\n \\nSydnee:  And can actually make you subjectively feel warmer as a result of \\nactivating those centers in your brain. \\n \\nJustin:  That\\'s cool. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, not that that\\'s going to—like, if you are exposed to the elements, \\nremembering a warm time—I feel like this is The Giver now that we\\'re in—[laughs] \\n \\nJustin:  [laughs]     \\nSydnee:  This is not The Giver! You still need to get to a warm place. I\\'m not \\nsuggesting otherwise. But, like, it might make you think you\\'re warmer than you \\nare. \\n \\nUm, there is actually, at the University of Southampton, there is a whole nostalgia \\ngroup that\\'s studying all these different effects on the human brain. And, like, \\nalso, what could we learn about memory from this? Um, they\\'ve tried this out \\nwith patients who have Alzheimer\\'s or some other form of dementia that has \\ncaused them some memory loss. They have found that accessing musical \\nmemories, they can remember those a lot more clearly than other memories that \\nare from the same time period, and you would assume both would be gone. So, \\nthere\\'s something special about certain sensations and things we can remember. \\nUm, the way we record those memories, and perhaps when it comes to things \\nthat are nostalgic, like a song that meant a lot to us or a show that meant a lot to \\nus or something, maybe we can use those tools to help patients with memory loss \\naccess those memories. \\n \\nJustin:  Hm! \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, there\\'s an adult daycare called Town Square that is all modeled \\nafter 1950\\'s America, um, because it looks like the environment that these \\npatients are nostalgic for, and so they function better within it. \\n \\nJustin:  Huh. \\n \\nSydnee:  They remember more of what you do in certain environments because \\nof that. So, there\\'s all sort of interesting implications. Um, and, you know, all of \\nthis evidence, all of this research is very preliminary, suggestive. I know on our \\nshow we\\'re all very clear that we don\\'t... one study does not mean something is \\nnecessarily true. But I think this is a good example of something that is benign. \\nTo indulge in nostalgia is... you know, at worst, a nice way to spend a few \\nminutes. [laughs] And at best, perhaps cathartic in an important way. Perhaps, \\num, gives you a good feeling. You know, helps with your mental well-being, helps \\nwith your ability to cope with a stressful situation, which I would argue we are all \\nin right now. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  Um, it\\'s a pretty—nobody\\'s trying to sell you anything, which is nice.    \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  They\\'re not trying to—[laughs] to sell you a nostalgia kit. Uh, you can \\nexperience it on your own. \\n \\nJustin:  I would actually argue there are many, many monthly subscription boxes \\nthat are doing precisely what you were telling me, but...  \\n \\nSydnee:  Well, and the moment that they start saying that they have research-\\nbased reasons to do this, and that they have medical evidence that these things \\nare good for you, I\\'ll be the first to decry them. But as long as we\\'re all just in \\nagreement that sometimes it feels nice, and it is not harmful to be nostalgic for \\nsomething that made you feel good once, long ago. Um, I think that that is—that \\nis okay. Maybe our animal spirits do need to spend more time there. Maybe that \\nwouldn\\'t be harmful. \\n \\nJustin:  Yeah. \\n \\nSydnee:  There\\'s a great book I\\'m still reading—I don\\'t usually name sources, \\nbut this book explores all these ideas, and then a lot more. So if this is something \\nthat interests you as much as it\\'s interested me, it\\'s called What Nostalgia Was: \\nWar, Empire, and the Time of a Deadly Emotion by Thomas Dodman. I\\'m reading \\nit, and... if this kind of—I don\\'t know. This just fascinated me, and if this \\nfascinates you, um, this has been a very interesting read. \\n \\nJustin:  Um, thank you so much for listening to our podcast. We hope in the \\nfuture you look fondly back on this time, wherein you were enjoying it. Uh, \\nthanks to The Taxpayers for the use of their song \"Medicines\" as the intro and \\noutro of our program. \\n \\nAnd, uh, thanks to the Maximum Fun Network for having us as part of their \\npodcasting family. And thanks to you for listening! We really appreciate it. Um, we \\nwill be back to you again next week, but until then, my name is Justin McElroy. \\n \\nSydnee:  I\\'m Sydnee McElroy. \\n \\nJustin:  And, as always, don\\'t drill a hole in your head! \\n \\n[theme music plays]    \\n***** \\n \\n \\nMaximumfun.org. \\nComedy and Culture. \\nArtist Owned. \\nAudience Supported.
