Cooking dinner, catching up on all the popular shows like Lupin, Blown Away, and even old episodes of The Office. Not the American one, but the original Luftnarp version where the main character is a one-eyed starling voiced by film legend Lee Marvin. It’s much more cutting in its humor. My favorite episode is when the whole staff learns to summon the Lost Souls of the Ancient Ones, and the starling sings a dirge about drowning in a lake. And then the corporate manager is interrogated by Interpol for successfully doing alchemy.',\n",
       "   'But TV has gotten old, and we got a touch of cabin fever, so we decided it was time to get out of the house, and go for a hike. On Saturday, we drove a few hours north to Redwood Remains State Park. We brought our little Esteban with us, because it’s never too early to introduce children to nature. It was a fun and spiritually rewarding trip. And there’s nothing like the mighty heights of centuries-old trees to make you feel small like a baby, held close and tight, protected from the dangers in the malicious sky above.',\n",

He’s looking at the night sky. He does not see the light change from red to green. Nor does he notice this process repeating. There is no one behind him to indicate his attention should be otherwise paid to the road. The intersection of High St and McDowell is curiously empty except for the man in his 2004 CRV.',\n",
       "   'If anyone else were around, and they were to look at the same night sky, they would see blackness and stars, the faint slit of a nearly-new moon. They may see an airplane or the wisp of a cloud. Yet Sergei sees something that anyone else would not. Sergei sees a triangle of bright orange lights. They do not move, nor blink. They simply are an inscrutable pyramid perched in the firmament. Sergei wonders if they are extra-terrestrial or just a trick of the eye. The traffic signal changes from red back to green, and the CRV does not move. No one else is around.',\n",
       "   'He is scared. He is hopeful too. Sergei hopes that he is to be abducted. Saved even. Taken away from his job, and his wife, and his dogs, and his family. Taken away from his CRV with its broken taillight. Taken away from High St and McDowell. He doesn’t know if the alien craft would imprison him, experiment on him, or even kill him. Everything that is unknown is hope.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Sergei does not pray, he only thinks of the possibilities of leaving his car, his body, his planet. And as the traffic signal changes again, Sergei opens his car door and steps out, jacketless, into the brisk night air. A swirling breeze curls his hair.',\n",

He showed us all kinds of flora and fauna, telling us tons of interesting facts about everything we encountered. We saw lots of dragonflies, some as large as my hand. There were hawks galore. Just the most hawks. Think of all the hawks you’ve ever seen. Now double that, then add 9, then divide by 3. THAT is how many hawks we saw in just a single afternoon. The hawks circled above us, which caused the rabbits to hop and scamper in all directions.',\n",

Esteban was disappointed that he could not pick up the rabbits, especially when one of the hawks did that very thing. Carlos had to explain the circle of life to our inconsolable son, which went over better than expected, especially because we found a little creek with some toads for Esteban to play with.',\n",

Even in the bright of day, they were so loud. So very loud. I asked my mother why the owls were so noisy, and she never answered me. Once I even found a sleeping raccoon, and a coyote was hunched over it playfully gnawing at its open belly. You learn so much in the woods. I’ll never forget those times.',\n",
       "   'Last Saturday in the woods, I heard the owls again, their low hoots and growls, ever-present. I had forgotten their sound, but it all came back to me. I asked Carlos why the owls were always making that noise, but he didn’t seem to know why, or even understand what I was asking. It was a wonderful day.',\n",
       "   'Watching Esteban and Carlos sitting on moss-covered rocks and pointing at fish and salamanders, I thought of what it must be like to have a dad, and how I was so glad that unlike me, Esteban has a loving father.

He tilled the soil and then covered it over in fresh sod and compacted dirt. He marked up the area with long chalk lines and built a fence at the far end. The corn fields are completely gone now. In their place is a baseball diamond. John said, “I was in my fields of invisible corn, and I heard this voice. The voice told me, ‘If you build it, he will stop by for a visit,’ And I knew it was the voice of my narrator.” John continued: “Like the ancient gods, I only exist because people talk about me, believe in me, and if the narrator of my life should ever discontinue his old yarn about old John, well, I’d cease to exist.

       "['Hi listeners. It’s been a dull winter, and I haven’t gotten out of the house much. My family and I have been nesting mostly, and that’s nice. Cooking dinner, catching up on all the popular shows like Lupin, Blown Away, and even old episodes of The Office. Not the American one, but the original Luftnarp version where the main character is a one-eyed starling voiced by film legend Lee Marvin. It’s much more cutting in its humor. My favorite episode is when the whole staff learns to summon the Lost Souls of the Ancient Ones, and the starling sings a dirge about drowning in a lake. And then the corporate manager is interrogated by Interpol for successfully doing alchemy.',\n",
       " 'But TV has gotten old, and we got a touch of cabin fever, so we decided it was time to get out of the house, and go for a hike. On Saturday, we drove a few hours north to Redwood Remains State Park. We brought our little Esteban with us, because it’s never too early to introduce children to nature. It was a fun and spiritually rewarding trip. And there’s nothing like the mighty heights of centuries-old trees to make you feel small like a baby, held close and tight, protected from the dangers in the malicious sky above.',\n",
       " 'I feel so refreshed. I can’t recommend the woods enough. What a rewarding time to spend with a family. It’s a trip that will stay with me forever. More on my hike soon.',\n",

       " 'But let’s have a look now at traffic. At the intersection of High St and McDowell sits a 2004 Honda CRV, silver, with a broken taillight. Inside the car is a man named Sergei. He’s looking at the night sky. He does not see the light change from red to green. Nor does he notice this process repeating. There is no one behind him to indicate his attention should be otherwise paid to the road. The intersection of High St and McDowell is curiously empty except for the man in his 2004 CRV.',\n",
       " 'If anyone else were around, and they were to look at the same night sky, they would see blackness and stars, the faint slit of a nearly-new moon. They may see an airplane or the wisp of a cloud. Yet Sergei sees something that anyone else would not. Sergei sees a triangle of bright orange lights. They do not move, nor blink. They simply are an inscrutable pyramid perched in the firmament. Sergei wonders if they are extra-terrestrial or just a trick of the eye. The traffic signal changes from red back to green, and the CRV does not move. No one else is around.',\n",
       " 'He is scared. He is hopeful too. Sergei hopes that he is to be abducted. Saved even. Taken away from his job, and his wife, and his dogs, and his family. Taken away from his CRV with its broken taillight. Taken away from High St and McDowell. He doesn’t know if the alien craft would imprison him, experiment on him, or even kill him. Everything that is unknown is hope.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Sergei does not pray, he only thinks of the possibilities of leaving his car, his body, his planet. And as the traffic signal changes again, Sergei opens his car door and steps out, jacketless, into the brisk night air. A swirling breeze curls his hair.',\n",
       " 'He stands in the center of the intersection of High St and McDowell and waves. He waves to the triumvirate of orange lights in the night sky, and he imagines someone or some thing waving back.',\n",

He showed us all kinds of flora and fauna, telling us tons of interesting facts about everything we encountered. We saw lots of dragonflies, some as large as my hand. There were hawks galore. Just the most hawks. Think of all the hawks you’ve ever seen. Now double that, then add 9, then divide by 3. THAT is how many hawks we saw in just a single afternoon. The hawks circled above us, which caused the rabbits to hop and scamper in all directions.',\n",
       " 'Our little 3-year-old shouted “bunnies!” He tried to pet them, but Carlos cautioned him that while most mammals look like they want hugs, almost none of them do. Esteban was disappointed that he could not pick up the rabbits, especially when one of the hawks did that very thing. Carlos had to explain the circle of life to our inconsolable son, which went over better than expected, especially because we found a little creek with some toads for Esteban to play with.',\n",
       " 'I remember going to the woods as a young boy with my sister and my mother. We used to go about 3 or 4 times each year on a long hike. What I recall most vividly were the owls. Even in the bright of day, they were so loud. So very loud. I asked my mother why the owls were so noisy, and she never answered me. Once I even found a sleeping raccoon, and a coyote was hunched over it playfully gnawing at its open belly. You learn so much in the woods. I’ll never forget those times.',\n",
       " 'Last Saturday in the woods, I heard the owls again, their low hoots and growls, ever-present. I had forgotten their sound, but it all came back to me. I asked Carlos why the owls were always making that noise, but he didn’t seem to know why, or even understand what I was asking. It was a wonderful day.',\n",
       " 'Watching Esteban and Carlos sitting on moss-covered rocks and pointing at fish and salamanders, I thought of what it must be like to have a dad, and how I was so glad that unlike me, Esteban has a loving father. In fact, he has two. That moment will stay with me forever. More on our trip soon.',\n",

They look a lot alike, those two. “Go into the tree,” the man tells the boy, and the boy does not want to. “It’s warm and quiet in there,” the man says to the boy.

He tilled the soil and then covered it over in fresh sod and compacted dirt. He marked up the area with long chalk lines and built a fence at the far end. The corn fields are completely gone now. In their place is a baseball diamond. John said, “I was in my fields of invisible corn, and I heard this voice. The voice told me, ‘If you build it, he will stop by for a visit,’ And I knew it was the voice of my narrator.” John continued: “Like the ancient gods, I only exist because people talk about me, believe in me, and if the narrator of my life should ever discontinue his old yarn about old John, well, I’d cease to exist. So I built it, like the man said. I built me a baseball diamond.”',\n",

That would’ve been nice, but Pat Lusk ',\n",
