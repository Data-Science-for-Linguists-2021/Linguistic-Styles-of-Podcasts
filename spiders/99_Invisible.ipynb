I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYour online activity creates tons and tons of data and that data is valuable. Entire sectors of the economy are built on this principle, but there is one data set that has proven to be so incredibly valuable because it was available for free for anyone to use. And this data was gathered during the investigation of a crime. This is the story of the Enron emails that were collected as the government was building the case to prosecute the company that became the poster child for corporate crime. But since then, these emails have helped to create new technologies, fight terrorism, and added to our understanding of how we communicate. It’s an incredible story and when I heard it on Business Insider’s “Brought to you by…” podcast, formerly called “Household Name,” I was like, damn, I wish we reported that. And since they did such a stellar job, I thought we’d just present their story to you. It is fascinating. You are going to love it. To guide you through this twisted tale of crime and data, here is Dan Bobkoff.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nImagine you’re working for a big company. Like, say, number 7 on the Fortune 500 list. Oh, and it’s around the year 2000. There’s no Facebook, no Gmail. We’re not thinking much about privacy. And then the company you work for goes bust in spectacular fashion.', '[KPRC: WELL, IT WAS THE CORPORATE FRAUD CASE THAT SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS HOUSTON AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, THE FALL OF ENRON…]', '[FOX26: CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS BEGIN THIS MORNING IN THE ENRON INVESTIGATION…]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nAnd then some regulator in Washington releases your work emails — all of them.

They’re just a few of the hundreds of thousands sent around the year 2000 by some of Enron’s highest-ranking employees. And when these emails became public, for the first time there was a database of thousands of real emails sent by real people that was available to the public, and researchers… and at least one podcast host. But these emails aren’t just a curiosity. They’re not just a time capsule. I bet something you used today was touched by these emails. They’ve become a huge part of all our lives.', '[MUSIC]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nFrom Business Insider and Stitcher, this is Household Name. Brands you know, stories you don’t. I’m Dan Bobkoff.', '[MUSIC CONTINUES]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nEnron collapsed because of greed and corruption and fraud. But the emails that Enron employees sent and received have had an astounding afterlife. They were used to create Siri and develop spam filtering and artificial intelligence. They’ve helped us understand gender and power. But at what cost? What happens when so much of our technology is based on the writings of some fallen energy tycoons? And should the emails have been released in the first place?', '[MUSIC ENDS]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThese days, Enron is pretty much shorthand for corporate scandal. But back in the ’90s, Enron was an energy trading company based in Houston. It bought, sold, and traded natural gas, electricity, and also apparently pulp and paper. But the thing Enron is really famous for is how it collapsed.', '[MUSIC]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nIn 2001, it was the biggest bankruptcy ever at that point. It looked suspicious because the company was telling everyone it was profitable and successful. And then out of nowhere, it went bust. The SEC investigated. Prosecutors pounced. A number of top executives went to prison for fraud.', '[NEWS REPORT: GUILTY VERDICTS IN THE BIGGEST CASE OF CORPORATE FRAUD IN HISTORY.]', '[NEWS REPORT: LAWYERS FOR JEFFERY SKILLING AND KENNETH LAY THREW AROUND COMPLICATED NOTIONS ABOUT MARGIN CALLS AND SHORT SELLING…]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nBut the reason we have access to thousands of Enron’s emails is because of something else. Something Enron did in California.', '[MUSIC]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nCalifornia became one of the first states to deregulate its energy markets in the mid-’90s. The idea was to introduce market forces and competition. You know, lower prices and such. Enron had lobbied hard for this. And then after deregulation came into play, mysteriously, California started experiencing serious energy shortages. And whenever that happened, Enron and some other companies just coincidentally raked in a whole bunch of cash.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nThe worst one was physical withholding. So you’d just say, ‘I’m not going to run my power plant tomorrow.’', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nPat Wood was an energy regulator with FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It was his job to help investigate this.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nNow, no one was dumb enough to say, ‘I’m not going to run it so I can make money off of the scarcity price.’ But that’s what happens, I mean when you don’t run your power plant, which they were obligated to do.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nWood says power suppliers would overplay maintenance issues. Exaggerate problems so they could shut down their plants.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nWhat kind of smart engineer’s going to actually go question that? I mean, you really had to get people under oath to really figure all this out.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThere were other tricks. Enron would buy power in California, move it to Nevada, and then sell it back at a profit. Enron was making bank, but by the second half of 2000, the tricks turned into a full-on energy crisis. Electricity prices in California shot up 800% at one point. There were rolling blackouts affecting more than a million people. Now, Pat Wood is a free markets guy. He was all for de-regulating California’s energy market. But what Enron did with that freedom is not what he had in mind when he was promoting free markets.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nI’m a big passionate defender of competition, but boy I’m ruthless against people who want to eff it up.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nSo FERC investigated Enron and the market manipulators, and through the investigation got tons of documents. Like these memos describing in detail how Enron planned to manipulate the California markets to make lots of money.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nThey were really pretty shocking. I mean, for one who loves competition in markets, it just kind of made me nauseated because I thought, ‘Man, is this the enterprise that I helped create, was this house of cards? I mean, this is ridiculous.’ So I walked down the hall and showed it to my other three commissioners and I said, ‘you know, I got a problem with this.’', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nDuring the investigation, Pat Wood and FERC were mostly focused on the memos. But they had also gotten a whole lot of emails from Enron.', 'Pat Wood:', '\\nIt was huge, it was thousands of… I don’t remember if it’s terabytes or whatever the word after tera is, but it was huge.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“So what were you finding in these emails that you wanted people to see?”', 'Pat Wood:', '\\n“You know, 95% of them were about nothing that we were interested in. But it’s hard to read. I mean, it was huge amounts of emails, so the other question was, there might be something that somebody finds here from reviewing this stuff that we might have missed.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nFERC had to decide what to do with all this data. In 2003, Pat Wood was pissed about what Enron had done. So he kept thinking about “transparency.” Just put it all out there and let the public see what this company did.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“But I’m sure behind the scenes, it must have been a hard decision to decide whether to release all these emails with all this personal information, and irrelevant things—”', 'Pat Wood:', '\\n“Yeah, I will tell you honestly Dan, that that issue was not front and center as much as it would be today, for example.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nSo Pat Wood and the FERC commissioners made a fateful decision. They just dumped the entire email archive on the internet. All the Enron emails about gas trading and meeting scheduling. And also the divorces and affairs and talk of parties. It was all there. I’ve heard different versions of what happened next. Some people say the emails were cleaned up. That someone went through and got rid of social security numbers, bank account info, and stuff like that. Other people say Enron employees were actually given a chance to go through and flag things they thought should be redacted. But either way, Pat Wood admits FERC didn’t try that hard to clean the emails up. And then after they were public, he just kind of forgot about the emails. Until I called a few weeks ago.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“And so what did you think would happen, when you put all these emails out in the world?”', 'Pat Wood:', '\\n“Never dreamed… I mean, when you told me… when did we talk? Last week. When you told me what had gone on, I can’t tell you how much I’ve been looking on the web since you pointed me in that direction. There is so much on the web about this information…and I had no idea that that would be what would come of this…”', '[MUSIC]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThe emails took on a life of their own. Far beyond what anyone at Enron or FERC could have imagined. Artificial intelligence, voice assistance, counterterrorism software. All have roots in the Enron emails. After FERC released the Enron emails back in 2003, they just kind of sat there. Even though they were public, no one was really reading them… because they were a MESS. Like, imagine you log into your email and you need to find one specific message. Except there’s no search function. You can’t organize by date or sender or subject line. There’s spam everywhere. That’s what the Enron emails were like. And there were like half a million of them. But this is where the Enron emails’ strange afterlife begins.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nFirst, some academics bought the emails from FERC. It became known as the Enron Corpus. Corpus by the way, is my new favorite word. The Enron Corpus cost ten grand. Then the researchers got to work cleaning it up, paring it down, and organizing it into something that could be cataloged and searched and studied. And then, they went wild. They wrote papers. Ran experiments. Invented whole new areas of research. Like… network science.', 'PJ Lamberson:', '\\nMy name is PJ Lamberson, and I’m an assistant professor in the communication department at UCLA. My research focuses on social networks and collaboration.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nWe called PJ Lamberson because he was actually our producer Sarah Wyman’s professor.', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Yeah, and that is a first day of class I will never forget.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“What happened?”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“It was just so cool! Like, we all came in, and on the board, he had projected a network that was made up of the Enron emails. And so what we’re looking at is a bunch of dots, basically, arranged in a pattern. And every dot represents an email address in the Corpus. And you can tell so much about Enron just from looking at this map, Dan.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“Like what?”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Some of the dots are bigger than other dots, which means that they’re getting more emails.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“So, are those the powerful people?”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Yeah. And you can also tell that some people are getting, like, way more emails than they’re sending, which is also kind of indicative of them being more important maybe? But then, the really cool thing… like the reason I still remember this class 4 years after the fact, is that if you take a step back and just look at the entire network, you see something that’s really interesting.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“What’s that?”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“So the way the map is organized, you can see projects.

But the thing is, at Enron, they were not making podcasts, Dan. Some people were actually doing some really sketchy, illegal things. And on this map, you can actually visually see the difference. Like, the projects that were totally above board and fine look completely different from the ones that were shady.”', 'PJ Lamberson:', '\\nI guess the way I would describe it, if you look at the network where people are talking about an illicit or illegal project, it looks like a really tight ball with a few little spikes sticking out of it. So what that’s showing is that, for those illegal projects, that the communication is really concentrated among a core of individuals, and they’re not sharing that information or dispersing information about that project with other parts of the organization.', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Okay, and this is the best part. Because a computer has identified this. It’s like a magic trick. The computer just has all of the data that’s in the Corpus, that in and of itself doesn’t actually make that much sense to anyone and it just looks like a huge mess, but once you run an algorithm on that data, it’s like shining a blacklight on all of the corruption that was happening at Enron. Like, you can just see it laid out bare in front of you in this network.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“Yeah, so this is clearly really useful to people for a lot of things.”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Yeah! And there’s so much cool stuff that’s happening with this technology. Like, people are using it to predict how viruses spread through populations. Because the software can identify the people within a group who are most likely to spread something to the rest of the group, fast.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“So, like the guy who’s just going around shaking lots of peoples’ hands will like show up in this algorithm.”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Right, but maybe one of the most interesting applications of this technology is it’s actually being used to identify terrorist cells. So like if you have phone records from a group of people, you can run these algorithms on those phone records and they can detect kind of abnormal patterns of communication. And you can see where the terrorist cells are.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“Okay. So the technology we developed using emails from Enron is now being used to fight terror.”', 'Sarah Wyman:', '\\n“Yeah, it’s being used for all kinds of stuff.”', '[MUSIC]', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThe Enron emails have been a huge opportunity for researchers like Sarah’s professor. They’re publicly available. There’s no copyright. Researchers can swap them between institutions because no one owns them. But they’ve also been a really big deal for any research or technology that involves language. Because these emails, this corpus, is a rare example of unfiltered, uncensored, totally organic human communication.', 'Owen Rambow:', '\\nSo the bankruptcy of Enron was really the wonderful stroke of luck for researchers interested in conversation.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThis is Owen Rambow. He works at an artificial intelligence company called Elemental Cognition, used to teach at Columbia. He’s been a part of lots of different research projects involving the Enron emails, and a lot of them involve using the Corpus to train computers to understand human language.', 'Owen Rambow:', '\\nIt’s unique. There’s nothing quite like it. And it’s real, you know these are real people who are conversing, not in order to create data for linguists, but in order to achieve their goals, whatever it was, some work-related goal or just tell each other jokes or whatever.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nBefore the Enron emails, researchers like Rambow mostly had to work with stilted conversations or text from old newspapers.', 'Owen Rambow:', '\\nOne typical example is that people, or students, are brought into a lab and play a game against each other and engage in conversation as part of the game playing. So they’re real conversations but they’re very limited and they’re not naturally occurring.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nBut these Enron emails were what people really say to one another, especially when they don’t think anyone is reading over their shoulder. And they’ve taught Rambow, and computers, a lot about how humans communicate. Like, based on syntax and word choice, you can predict if an email’s sender is male or female. A boss or an underling. Bosses write shorter emails. Male bosses tend to write direct emails like “give me the report by Monday.” Female bosses tend to say things like “would you be able to finish the report by Monday?”', 'Owen Rambow:', '\\nI can say something like, ‘it’s hot in here’ and it can either be a speech act to inform you of this fact or it can be a speech act to request that you turn on the air conditioning.', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\n“It is hot in here. I’m sorry.”', 'Owen Rambow:', '\\n“Yep. It’s actually okay.”', 'Dan Bobkoff:', '\\nThese are the kinds of problems that cause bugs in artificial intelligence. Machines aren’t great at interpreting nuance or tone or intent. They need practice. And the Enron Corpus is like one giant, perfect training ground for developing those skills.

We haven’t studied the bacteria and microbes that live inside our homes all that much. What is living there, how bad is it? What kind of a forest am I living in?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, well so one study to start to quantify this comes from North Carolina, and they studied several dozen homes there, and they found that on average, the homes housed 2,000 different types of microbes. So that is mostly bacteria, but it does also include some fungi, and it’s actually more diverse inside our homes than outside them, and that’s because the microbes are coming from a couple of different sources. So the vast majority of bacteria in our homes, at least, are coming from us. So we now know that our bodies are covered with and full of microbes, and when we move around a space, we are shedding them constantly, so that’s a large part of what’s in our homes.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nBut then there are also species that live in our homes. Maybe they’re growing in the plumbing, or they’re growing in the insulation. One of my favorite home environments is the extreme environment of the dishwasher or the washing machine. So if you think about what’s happening in there, it’s mostly bone dry, which microbes don’t like, but then every once in a while it gets completely saturated with water, it gets real hot, you put detergent in it, and it turns out that’s selected for these strange kinds of black yeasts that don’t look anything like any other yeasts scientists have found anywhere, so it seems to be this unique ecosystem. And then finally, we have the microbes that are drifting in from outdoors, so things that live in the soil or in water, and it attaches to us or comes in through an open door or window. So you have all these different sources of microbes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou talk in the book about another kind of strange Petri dish inside your apartment that you were interested in — you sent in your shower head to be studied. What did they find in your shower head?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, so shower heads are also interesting environments because they are also these sorts of extreme environments which are dry the vast majority of the time, but then all of a sudden get flooded, and some of what they found in my shower head was not very surprising. So there was lots of bacteria that typically lives in tap water and in soil, and no one was surprised to see that, but there were other creatures that were still pretty mysterious. So my favorite is something that scientists have not studied very much at all yet, it doesn’t even have a real scientific name, it just goes by the very poetic RB41 right now, and two other places it’s been documented are dog noses and paleolithic cave paintings. And so we have this bacteria that we don’t know really what it does or why it’s in my showerhead, and what my showerhead might have in common with these other environments, it’s all still kind of a mystery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo do these microbes in our homes, do they make us sick, or do they make us healthier because they… We build up immunities to these things and other things because of them? What is this overall effect of them on us?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nAs far as we know, the vast majority of these microbes are innocuous. They don’t seem to affect us one way or the other. And a lot of them are coming from us to begin with, so they’re already microbes that are living in and on our bodies. but there are some on both sides of the spectrum. So there are absolutely some pathogens, which I know is something we’re thinking a lot about right now, some of us may have coronavirus in our homes. We know that certain kinds of molds can trigger allergies and asthma, there are certain types of bacteria that live in plumbing that can cause lung infections.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nBut that’s a small fraction of what’s in our homes, and there’s good reason to think that some of these microbes are actually good for us. So there’s a growing body of literature that suggests that kids who grow up surrounded by a rich assortment of microbes actually are less likely to develop allergies and asthma and autoimmune disease, and the theory is because exposure to all these microbes early in life essentially helps train your immune system so it doesn’t overreact later on.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSpeaking of the microbes that are kind of good for us, you mentioned that homes with dogs have healthier microbiomes, tell me about that?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, this is satisfying to me as a long-time dog owner and lover, but dogs introduce a lot of new microbes into a home. So they’re the microbes that actually live in and on the dog, but then most dogs are going in and outside, and so they’re tracking in soil microbes, stuff from grass, microbes from whatever they’ve eaten at the dog park, and for whatever reason, some of these microbes seem to be associated with our immune health, so there are studies that show that kids that grow up with dogs have a lower propensity for developing asthma and allergies and some of those conditions. So it’s a bit tricky to isolate which microbes those are, that’s something that science has not been able to do very well yet, but something about the community of microbes that dogs are introducing into homes seems to be protective.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd we’ve introduced a lot of products in the last few years that are anti-microbial, including window cleaners and hand soaps and floor cleaners, all kinds of stuff. Have they made our homes healthier?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nI think it’s a little too early to answer that definitively, but there are some worrisome signs that maybe they’re having a negative effect on our home microbiome. So there is some research that suggests that the more you use anti-microbial chemicals in your home, like cleansers, the more that the bacteria there are evolving resistance to those chemicals, so that’s one potentially negative ramification, is that using all these cleansers could be helping to drive the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The other potential problem is that cleaning with something like that is sort of a crop duster approach, and you might be wiping out the microbes that are good for us along with anything dangerous, so I think there’s reason to be pretty cautious using these products.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn terms of indoor health, the biggest factor might be air quality, and it’s another factor that we don’t know much about, so how bad is the air that we’re breathing indoors?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, so that’s one of the things that we’re still trying to get a better handle on. I mean, one trend that does seem apparent is at least here in the U.S., in most places, outdoor air has gotten much better over the course of the 20th century, and partly that’s because of regulation. We have brought down emissions. But one result of that is that for many people, their primary source of exposure to air pollution happens indoors now. So that comes from all sorts of sources, some of it is just the products we fill our homes with, so things like our sofa, our flooring, all of our personal care products just release all of these chemicals into the air. But then our own behavior and activities inside our homes can also generate pollution, so cooking and cleaning are the big ones that are known to generate these big spikes in air pollution.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, air quality is an understudied problem, but it’s not a new problem. You have this whole chapter on ventilation in health, and you talk about how Florence Nightingale used to advocate for open windows in hospitals, and that was back in the 19th century, and I was thinking about this the last time I was in the hospital, and it was not open at all, there was no fresh air, it was totally sealed up. Can you talk about the back and forth of how we see ventilation?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, so there’s been an interesting history here, and hospitals several centuries ago were not a place you would want to go if you were sick. If you could afford it, you would get a doctor to come to you, and so hospitals were really… They were dirty, they were unhygienic, they were overcrowded. In some places, patients even shared not just rooms, but beds, which you can imagine is not great for the spread of infectious disease. And Florence Nightingale was one of these reformers who came along and advocated better sanitation, like basic stuff that now we sort of take for granted, like actually adequate drainage in a hospital room so fluids weren’t just sitting there, and opening windows, and daylight. And one of the interesting things was that she didn’t really understand the mechanism of infectious disease.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nI mean, nobody did at that time. Germ theory was not a widely-accepted disease mechanism. But she intuited and she observed that patients did better when she let more fresh air in and let more light in, and that was a trend in hospital design for a short period of time, towards the end of the 19th century especially. But then when germ theory did become more widely accepted and we had antisepsis and anti-microbial chemicals, and technology improved, we sort of moved in the other direction, and hospitals began to close themselves up and rely on chemicals for disinfection, and technology, and they became these hermetically-sealed spaces. And I think one thing we have learned is that we have gone too far in that direction, and we need to figure out ways to create more permeability between our indoor and our outdoor spaces.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, right now in this current health crisis, we’re learning about the importance of ventilation all over again, what do you make of that?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nEven before the pandemic hit, I think there was a slow-growing realization that indoor air quality was important and that ventilation was important, but the pandemic has absolutely accelerated that trend and made a lot of people think a lot more about air quality and ventilation than I bet they ever had before, and we know that increasing ventilation and bringing in more fresh air from outside, and changing the air over more often, can all really reduce the spread of infectious disease indoors.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nI think some of the improvements that we are thinking about making now – and here I’m thinking particularly about what’s happening in schools, where school ventilation systems are being overhauled and improved – will have a lot of dividends even when the pandemic is over. We know that improving ventilation can improve our cognitive performance, and could improve student learning in schools, and schools have been sort of criminally under-ventilated in America for a long time. And so this is not how anyone would have wanted schools to be overhauling their ventilation systems, but it’s long overdue, and I’m hoping that the pandemic will lead to improvements in that regard that pay off for a long time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs the solution for making a healthier indoor space is just to make it more like the outdoors? Is that what we’re learning?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nWell, that is one of the ironies of what I learned when researching the book that I… I was not necessarily expecting that. I talk about how I’m an indoorsy person, and I wasn’t necessarily expecting one of the takeaway lessons to be “to create a healthy indoor space, make it more like the outdoors,” but that does seem to be a lesson. So it applies to fresh air, but bringing in sunlight, bringing in elements of nature, bringing in outdoor microbes, all of those things seem to have a variety of health benefits.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMore nature. It seems like it’s connected to learning about dog noses and cave paintings, it feels like we keep forgetting that we’re actually animals, and we have to keep learning that.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, absolutely, and we now know that there are ecosystems in our homes, but we are also part of those ecosystems, they’re not systems that exist separate from us, we affect the microbes that colonize our homes, and they affect us back, and the same thing with insects and rodents, and all sorts of other stuff that might be living in our homes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight now, designers are coming up with new ways to combat the bad air and the bad lighting, and all the unhealthy parts of life indoors, and while those design solutions are really promising, sometimes they have unintended consequences. So, Emily, you talk about this Bronx housing development that was designed to make its residents more healthy, what did they do?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nThis is a housing development known as Arbor House, and it was designed with the principles of what has become known as active design, and the idea behind active design is can we subtly encourage people to get more physical activity just as part of their everyday lives, so without telling them to go to the gym three days a week? And it’s based on research that shows that even just a modest increase in physical activity, so you know, climbing three flights of stairs a day, can have long-term benefits for our health. So Arbor House is an eight-story affordable housing complex in the Bronx, and it opened in 2013, and it has all sorts of features that are designed to make physical activity appealing, fun, and sort of part of the default behavior. So the most obvious example has to do with stairs and elevators. If you think about any high-rise building you go into that has elevators, normally they’re the first thing you see, they’re gleaming, they’re prominent in the lobby, and if you can find the stairs at all, they’re hidden behind a heavy fire door, and it’s flickering fluorescent lights, and it’s just not appealing.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nBut the principles of active design, and which were used here at Arbor House, really try to flip the script. So how can we make the stairs more appealing and more fun, and the default behavior? So they’ve done that in a couple of ways here. There are motivational signs by the elevators that encourage residents to take the stairs instead, which a number of studies suggest is effective, but then there are also things like there’s art hanging in the stairwells, and there’s music playing in the stairwells, which residents in focus groups have said they and their kids actually liked so much that it made them take the stairs more often. And there are more subtle things too, like the stairs are wide and they’re well-lit, and they’re safe, which isn’t always true in some of these affordable housing complexes. There were residents who said they didn’t feel safe taking the stairs at their old apartment buildings because it was dark and you couldn’t see who else was in there, but here it’s open and visible and prominent. That’s one set of strategies that designers can use to encourage more physical activity. There are others as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And are there some drawbacks to pushing people to use stairs? It seems like you can make the stairs more appealing, but you could also make the elevators less convenient, which doesn’t serve everyone in the population.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, that’s a really good point, and that is the big drawback I think about when it comes to certain strategies for active design, and in fact, Arbor House has employed one strategy that I don’t think is great from an accessibility standpoint, which is to deliberately slow down the elevators. That, as you can imagine, is an incredible inconvenience for people who can’t or don’t want to use the stairs. So I do think that some of these strategies are much better choices from an accessibility standpoint, so as you can imagine, adding art and music to a stairwell is not going to inconvenience someone who can’t take the stairs, but slowing the elevators down does. So can things like skip-stop elevators, which only open every other floor, which is another strategy, so I think designers need to be really careful about which of these techniques they employ.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEmily Anthes will tell us about one incredibly easy trick to make our homes healthier, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I want to talk a little bit about other sort of design solutions for making the inside healthier. A lot of designers are thinking about smart homes as a way of making the indoors healthier with sensors that open the windows if there’s bad air quality or they call 911 automatically if someone falls. A lot of this stuff, it feels very designy. It feels very utopian. I have to admit, I find it kind of dystopian. How do you feel about smart homes and their promise?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nI think it is both. And there are, you know… It can be utopian and dystopian and in fact, the same devices and technology can be both depending on how it’s used. I mean, I think there is enormous potential here, especially when you look at some of the sectors where it’s being applied first. I write a lot about the senior care community and we don’t have a great system of senior care here in the U.S. And lots of seniors want to continue to live independently in their own homes. But often that’s difficult, especially if they’re living alone. And so I think there is potential there for technology to make that safer, whether that’s sensors built into the floor that can detect a fall or a smart oven sensor that can remind someone with dementia to turn off the oven. But there’s a lot of risk there, too. You know, privacy. Also, when you think about the senior care community, that raises even, I guess, stickier questions of consent. I talked to some researchers who said people’s middle-aged children are really excited to install these monitoring systems, but the seniors themselves were not necessarily always open to them. So there are a lot of dangers here, too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so if people are listening to this and they’re in their homes, most likely 90% chance they’re in their home listening to this, what can they do to make their home healthier right now? Like, what would you tell someone to do to make their house a healthier place?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nOne thing we haven’t talked about yet, which is probably my top recommendation for everyone, is nature. There is just an incredible body of research that demonstrates that exposure to nature has enormous and wide-ranging benefits from reducing stress and pain to boosting mood concentration, productivity, improving the immune system. I mean, almost, you name it, nature benefits it. And the interesting thing about it is that it doesn’t seem to have to be a particular kind of nature. So a lot of the original studies were done on views and they found that people who had views of natural landscapes recovered faster from surgery than those who didn’t. And so if you have views of natural landscapes, that’s great. But studies suggest that even something like bringing houseplants into your home has some of the same benefits and so does nature imagery. So putting photographs of natural landscapes up on your wall can help. And so, interestingly, do nature sounds so listening to birdsong or babbling brook or something over speakers over your headphones can have some of the same stress alleviating effects. So any way you can find to bring some element of greenery or the natural world into your living space, I highly recommend.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI like that you could play bird song and it would help you out. That’s brilliant.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nAnd actually, I believe there’s a study that even fake plants like plastic plants, like if you like houseplants, but you just really have a black thumb, you could maybe get some of the same stress relief from bringing in some faux greenery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n(Laughs) That’s amazing. That’s amazing.', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nYeah, well, the research suggests and most scientists think that this is a psychologically mediated effect and they explain it with what’s known as the Biophilia hypothesis, which is that because of how we evolved, sort of out in the rough and tumble of nature, we have this innate affinity for and attraction to nature. And so whether it’s an actual landscape out the window or a photo of a landscape on the wall, it sort of catches our attention. It engages us. It serves as a positive distraction, sort of taking our mind off of whatever might be stressing us out, our pain and the other benefits sort of follow from that psychological positive distraction.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo let’s talk a little bit about COVID and things that we might be able to continue on. So a lot of us have been thinking differently about the indoors because of COVID. What are some of the things you think might change about the design of our indoor spaces that we’re experimenting with now that we might keep when the pandemic is over?', 'Emily Anthes:', '\\nI think we might see people thinking more about flexibility and how we can design flexible spaces. You know, most directly related, you can think of hospitals and you’ve seen hospital capacity just swell. I have talked to health care designers who have said we want to think about how we can design hospitals that can suddenly treat many more patients if need be in the future. But even at the level of our home, we are suddenly having to carve out workspaces and classrooms in our homes, which we probably weren’t expecting. and so I think we will see an emphasis on creating homes and other buildings that have adaptive use or maybe flexible use of space, maybe partitions or movable room dividers. Things like that, I think will be helpful and in demand. And, you know, even if you’re building a house post-COVID, there could always be another pandemic or who knows what else, natural disasters, more uncertainty. And so I think the more we can create indoor spaces that we can quickly adapt for new uses, the better off will be.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEmily Anthes’s book is called “The Great Indoors: The Surprising Science of How Buildings Shape Our Behavior, Health, and Happiness.” It is so good.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'I don’t have a favorite podcast. It’d be too unfair. There are too many I like. It is hard to choose just one but when people ask me that question, I always make sure to mention the Radiotopia show, Song Exploder. I think it is the perfect concept for a podcast. If you haven’t heard it, my friend, Hrishikesh Hirway, interviews musical artists and gets them to break down a song into its component parts to show how it all came together. It’s recently been adapted into a Netflix TV show. It is so much fun to watch. I hope you check it out.', 'And we love Song Exploder here on the show so much that in a meeting a few months ago, we thought, “What if we tried to do that for one of our own songs?” You might know that we have our own composer here at 99PI, her name is Sean Real, and hiring her was one of the best decisions I ever made. I love that we have our own in-house composer. I love working with Sean. And Sean works with all the producers to score our episodes with original music that she writes and records right here in Oakland. So, on this episode, we are bringing you a tribute to the brilliant podcast Song Exploder and our brilliant composer, Sean Real, and we’re calling it Sean Exploder. It’s the story of a song that Sean wrote for Avery Trufelman back when she worked here. It’s called “The Loom” and it’s the first song in Avery’s spinoff series, Articles of Interest. And to tell the story of the song, you really need to start at the beginning of Avery and Sean’s relationship. I’ll let Sean take it from here.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nHi. My name is Sean Real. I’m the composer for 99% Invisible. I’ve been with the show for four years now but before that, I was playing music in bands and making a living walking dogs. Dog-walking is actually mostly driving and picking up dogs, so a lot of listening to stuff in the car, and at a certain point, you just get sick of music so that’s when I started religiously listening to podcasts and I couldn’t refresh the feed fast enough.', 'And the music was a big part of it too, I think that was a big part of what made it feel like this new art for me and part of me thought I could write that music, but then I thought, they probably just pull it from some music library here or something. There’s not one person who writes music for podcasts and so then I would just put it out of my head.', 'I was getting to a point where working all day and then going home and trying to find the energy to work on music with my bands Little Teeth and Basement, the sustainability had run out. I was emotionally and energetically bankrupt. It’s like trying to be like, there has to be a way out of this without, like, writing a hit song that’s going to make me rich and famous. Like, there has to be a way to make this a living and then I met Avery.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nHi, I’m Avery Trufelman. I am the host of the podcast, The Cut, from New York Magazine but for most of my life, I worked at 99% Invisible. Sean and I met on OkCupid which is now considered the old-fashioned way to meet someone. It’s quaint when you hear that someone met on OkCupid. It’s like, “That’s romance. You had to read a whole profile.” One of the stupid questions OkCupid asks you is, “What’s the first thing people notice about you?” And I was like, “My voice.” And I think Sean responded and said something, “I have a pretty signature voice too.” And so we started sharing these voice memos back and forth for a long time before we ever met, we had this very radio courtship. I remember walking down to the office, like, walking down Telegraph Avenue, three miles, like blah-blah-blah…. leaving voice memos for Sean.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nOne time I was just recording a voice memo and then I looked at it, I was like, “Oh God, this is 45 minutes. I’m about to send a 45-minute voice memo.” And I texted you and I was like, “This is 45 minutes. Is this too much?” And you responded, “You know I’m about to get on the plane, please send it now, I need something to listen to.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI distinctly remember that. I distinctly remember being like “Download! Download! Download!” before the plane took off. It was so fun. So we exchanged voice memos for a long time before ever meeting and then we finally met and I spent a lot of time hanging out in Sean’s house, going to Sean’s shows, getting to know all the band drama, Sean’s band. We dated, I think it was four months, we dated for a while, and then honestly this musical relationship was sort of our way back to friendship. So I was working on the story called “Miss Manhattan” and it was a story about the most famous model in all of New York, she appears on statues all over the city and also in other cities across America. She was a famous artist model and this was a story about one woman’s life and it was very dramatic and more cinematic than anything I’d tried to cover in the past and I realized that a lot of the music beds we used were these rhythmic jams that keep you humming along, but this was a story with real high “highs” and low “lows”. I wanted it to be scored almost like a film. I didn’t know a lot of musicians and I thought of Sean.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nFor Avery to be like, “Would you want to make some music for 99% Invisible?” I was just … woah. It felt… it’s like a dream come true. The thing that I thought could never actually be a real thing was actually possible.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWorking with Sean felt like mixing paint for the first time. Before it felt a little paint by numbers, I was like, “Okay, well, we got…” There’s a good song we like to use when things get happy and there’s a good plodding, talky-talk song. I used to call the genre “thoughtcore”, that was like … Then you had the plinky-plonks, the like boop-ba-doop-pa-doop… like, music to talk over. And then Sean was able to address all of these different nuances in the ways a story can take a turn. You can have music that moves with the narrative and I didn’t even realize how badly I wanted that. When you’re talking about stories about buildings and stories about objects, it’s weirdly more complicated. It’s not like, “And this is where it was sad, and this is where it was excited and happy.” It’s always like, “Can we make it like a ponderous but a little dark? Can we make it exhilarating, but also a little sinister?” It felt like mixing paint, it felt like Sean was helping make new colors.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI love collaborating with people and I think that’s one of the things I love so much about this job, about working for the show, is that everything that I write is, like, it’s for the show but it’s also very much for the person who is producing the episode. And over the years, I worked with all the producers and was developing our working relationships with, what kind of music works for which people? For example, Emmett or Vivian might ask me to make something that would highlight how silly or delightful something is. Katie might want music that is more neutral but has a cool beat and I felt like I could always count on Avery to really want to pull me in a new direction, to be like, “Let’s do something experimental. Let’s really blow their minds this time.” And it was sad to think that I’d be losing that with Avery when she started working on Articles of Interest, which is the 99pi show about clothes. Avery was working with a different musician to score it, Rhae Royal, but lucky for me, Avery decided she wanted to bring me back for this one crucial song.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI wanted to start off with a launching point, like why talk about textiles at all? And it began with the origin of the computer and the computer punch card which came from a loom. A loom was arguably the first computer. It was the first to have an automated form of weaving and that’s where the punch card came from that eventually led to the computer. And so, this felt extremely like wheelhouse 99pi. That’s a cool fact, that’s a cool story to get people into the series.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd then as I was learning about punch cards, it was like, “This is also the same technology that makes music boxes.” It would cool to have a music box sound, so that people would be like, “Punch cards, I know what those are.” If you’ve seen a player piano or a music box, it’s that exact same technology where there is a hole or not a hole, basically the equivalent of one or zero and that decides if there is going to be a note there or not. So I turned to Sean and I was like, “Could you make a music box song?”', 'Sean Real:', '\\nAnd immediately, I was like, “Oh (beep), yes, I want to do that.” I was like, “How can I make a music box kick-ass?” And Avery didn’t just want something that sounded like a music box, Avery wanted the real thing, so she gave me this children’s make-your-own music box kit.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo I ordered it to the office, I was like, “All right, here is the music box I ordered for you, go make a song for Articles of Interest.”', 'Sean Real:', '\\nAnd the music box isn’t really an instrument so much as it’s a machine. You program it by punching holes in these little punch cards and then you run those through it as you turn the hand crank and the holes from the punch cards trigger little times in the music box. Each time produces a note and you have to punch the holes in exactly the right place to get the right note and also get the right rhythm. I didn’t want to start punching holes until I knew what the song was, what I wanted the song to sound like and so I started out by making a few demos on the computer using a digital instrument in place of the music box. And I was really thinking this is a way to introduce this new series with a bang. How do I make a walk-on song for Avery?', '[DEMO 1: RENDITION OF WALK-ON MUSIC]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nBut then pretty quickly, I was like, “This is cheesy actually and I’m leaning in a little too hard to that and actually, music box part is barely in this demo.” And so then I came up with another idea that was a lot more driven by the music box and sounded more like a music box.', '[DEMO 2: RENDITION OF MUSIC BOX]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nBut then I thought it sounded too much like a music box, it just makes me think of every music box you see in a movie is a porcelain ballerina slowly spinning and I was just like, “How can we make it sound a little more unique?” How can I make the music box actually feel like it is less of a toy and more of an instrument? How can I make it a valid instrument in an orchestra? And so that’s where the third idea came from.', '[DEMO 3: RENDITION OF MUSIC BOX LEADING AN ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nIt’s interesting. This one kind of accomplishes on paper all of the things I wanted to do – make a music box, lead an orchestra – except that it kinda lost that kicking ass walk-on song feeling. But then someday later I was in the shower and I just started hearing this circular melody in my head. There was this line in the episode in the script about going around and around like the punch card programming for a player piano or a music box, or an old computer, and I was like, “Oh, I think I have it.” And so I just ran to my keyboard to just get this idea out.', '[DEMO 4: RENDITION OF CIRCULAR MUSIC BOX SONG]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThe way the notes circled around, it feels to me like turning the crank up the music box. But remember I wrote this on the computer so the next step was to program the actual music box that Avery gave me to play the part. I took my time because I wanted to be really careful and make sure I wasn’t going to punch any holes in the wrong places, but eventually, I finished poking holes in the paper and I tested it out. And I think what was really magical was just hearing this music that I had made in the ephemeral computer world being made by this tangible little machine. I don’t know, I felt like I had really made something and the next step was to record it, and I wanted the music box to start out slow and then gradually speed up. And so to do that, I recorded a few different takes at different speeds and the first one I did was really slow.', '[GEARS TURNING & SQUEAKS]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYou can actually really hear the little gears turning and the little squeak from the crank. I really loved that sound.', '[SLOW MUSIC BOX: GEARS TURNING & SQUEAKS]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI love when you can hear component parts of a sound like you don’t just hear the sound but you hear what’s making the sound. I love hearing the strings of a violin or something like that scrape of the bow, maybe I could have done some stuff to lessen the squeak but I loved the squeak. I just wanted to let it be as squeaky as it was. And then I did another one that was a little bit faster.', '[MEDIUM MUSIC BOX: NOTES WITH GEARS & SQUEAKS]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI had a tempo in mind that I wanted to build to, that I wanted the other instruments to come up over and in order to get it to go that fast, I had to crank it really fast and this tiny little crank is not very ergonomic, so I’m just like whomp-whomp-whomp-whomp-whomp… There was a moment where I was like, “I’m not going to be able to keep this up consistently enough to have a consistent rhythm, it’s just going to sound like a mess.” So I had to practice it a lot before I could get a good recording of the fast take.', '[FAST MUSIC BOX]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI’m not sure if anybody would listen to that – the music box on its own – and think like driving but when I hear that, I hear…da-da-da-da-da. That’s what the rhythm is doing to me. That’s the syncopation that I can hear in my head and so that’s naturally how I started playing the next instrument. I really love contrast in music so I wanted the next instrument that you hear to be the polar opposite of the music box. So I got my stand up bass and just started going… da-da-da-da-da.', '[BASS STEM]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nLike choppy, just like driving eighth notes. And then I really wanted to emphasize that chop so I also did a really high note on the base so that that cutting rhythm would be unmistakable or something.', '[BASS STEM WITH HI NOTES]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nAnd so then just as I brought in this harsh choppy base in order to counter the pretty little music box, I wanted to counter a choppy sound with long, very pretty tones from the cello.', '[CELLO]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThis cello belongs to one of my old bandmates and she was nice enough to let me borrow it for this. It just has this really full and moody sound that I love. I had all these other ideas for other instruments to come in too and bring it to the next place and have a huge crashing ending, but something that I’ve consistently learned from this job is that less is more and a lot of times it makes just as much sense or more sense to get something that’s good and then quit while you’re ahead. And now I really love how this song ends, I’m really happy with how it ended up.', '[CLIP FROM “THE LOOM”]', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI felt with just these few little components, I had really accomplished the things I had set out to do which were making the music box feel bigger and badder than you normally think of it and making a song that matched and played off of the content of the story, and giving Avery this opening and closing of a chapter song for her opening and closing of a chapter series. When I was getting ready to play it for Avery, I was having just a little bit of worry that “I know I’m proud of this but the real test is showing it to the producer, getting notes, getting my ego checked a little bit.” So even with how proud I was of it, I was still protecting myself a little bit. I was ready to be like, “It doesn’t mean that you’re a bad musician, it just means that this is a process.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe process of making Articles of Interest was really all over the place and I remember one day, I was feeling really scared and nervous about Articles of Interest and if it would all come together in time, and I remember Sean being like, “Hey, I want to show you something.” And she brought me into her office and from my memory, you played the song for me and it was just already done. It was immaculate conception perfect and I remember the minute you played it for me when the bass kicked in, I started crying and I was like, “Sean, it’s perfect.” And I remember it made me feel so calm, I was like, “Maybe this will be good.” Maybe this series will be good and then putting it under that moment when Roman handed the series off to me, I was like,”Oh (bleep) yeah, this is great, this rules.”', '[CLIP FROM ARTICLES OF INTEREST #1:', 'ROMAN MARS: WHEN YOU CRANK THE GEAR OF A MUSIC BOX, YOU CAN MAKE THE TUNE GO AS FAST OR AS SLOWLY AS YOU WANT AS YOU SPIN THE LITTLE HANDLE AROUND AND AROUND.', 'AVERY TRUFELMAN: THE MUSIC IS READ FROM THE SERIES OF LITTLE BUMPS LIKE BRAILLE.', 'ROMAN MARS: PRODUCER AVERY TRUFELMAN.', 'AVERY TRUFELMAN: THESE LITTLE BUMPS STICK UP AND THEY HIT A SERIES OF TIMES WHICH CREATE A SONG.]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd it’s funny. I hear this song being used in other 99PpiI episodes sometimes and I always get really possessive. I’m like, “Hey! Like, you’re dancing with my girl.” It’s a great song, I don’t fault anyone else for using it, it’s an amazing song but I do feel like, “I will dual you, sir. She is mine,” this song.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nSo a bit after Articles of Interest was finished and it was becoming more clear that Avery would be leaving the show at some point, I had the music box and I felt like Avery should have it. I felt I wanted Avery to be able to hold on to this physical token of the best that our working relationship had brought us and so I had a friend of mine actually make a little wooden case to put the little music box machine inside of. And so I had an actual nice little wooden music box that I gave to Avery as a gift.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd I have the box here — it’s the music box.', '[MUSIC BOX PLAYS]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIf I keep playing it, it’s going to make me cry.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDo you remember… airplane travel? Packing into a tin can with 200 other people all breathing each other’s air? Well, these days, most of us are still avoiding planes but, in the before times, when we boarded a flight, we all received the same familiar set of instructions.', '[FLIGHT ATTENDANT: FOR EVERYONE’S SAFETY, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO REVIEW THE SAFETY INFORMATION CARD, WHICH IS IN YOUR SEAT POCKET.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you’ve ever flown on a plane, you’ve been directed to study the plane safety briefing card. Every passenger plane, commercial or private, has to have safety cards on board. And, if you’re like most people, you probably never bothered to examine it too closely. That is if you’ve even looked at it at all.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nI always look at these things. As soon as I sit down on a plane, I pull out the safety card.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nToday, I’m going to be talking with producer Mo LaBorde, about why safety cards might be worth a closer look.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nHi Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHi Mo. So, you’re saying you always pull out the safety card?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. I mean, what can I say? I just love airplane safety cards. Honestly, I think I love them a little bit too much. I don’t just look at them, I collect them. I’ve been collecting for about 10 years.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n10 years. So, when you say you collect them, what do you mean?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nWell, whenever I fly on a plane, I just snagged the card and I put it in my backpack.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo you just take them. Is that allowed? Is that a problem?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nIt’s a good question because it’s technically not allowed, but I just have such a strong kleptomania for this one object. Today in my collection, I have about 300.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s cool. So, why do you have 300 safety cards?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nI think it’s that, for me, I fell in love with them because they’re safety themed comic strips. The outfits of the women are stuck in the 1960s, there are little girls wearing Mary Jane shoes and Bobbysocks, and the way they look is so fascinating to me. But, more than that, I am especially fascinated with the way that they depict a plane crash. It’s this alternate version of events where there’s no blood, there’s no wreckage from the crash, nobody’s distressed, and their hair doesn’t even get messed up. It’s so obviously the opposite of what an actual plane crash would look like.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely. When I see these cards, I always think of the movie “Fight Club” where Brad Pitt’s character outright mocks the way that people look on these cards.', '[TYLER DURDEN: EMERGENCY WATER LANDING, 600 MILES AN HOUR, BLANK FACES, CALM AS HINDU COWS. THE ILLUSION OF SAFETY.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then, later on, you see Ed Norton and Brad Pitt replace the normal safety cards with cards where everyone is, like, freaked out and panicking.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And I think that the “Fight Club” scene gets at something about how most of us think the cards aren’t actually necessary. At some gut level, we just assume that if we’re in a crash, everyone’s going to die. But then, after I began collecting them, I started looking into the history of these cards and where they come from. And, basically, what I learned is that we have that all wrong. Safety cards work.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nReally? I would not have thought that.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah, reading a safety card can save your life. But also it turns out that safety cards have played a central role in our evolving understanding of how to survive a plane crash.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAll right. Well, tell me more. What is it that we owe to the safety card?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nWell, to answer that first, we have to go back a ways to a time when safety cards were pretty much useless. In fact, they weren’t even really about safety because in the early days of passenger airplane travel, in the 1930s, there was no regulation at all about what should go on the cards. And in the beginning, airlines had to convince people to get on planes because people were scared to fly. So, the early cards were all about soothing passengers, selling them on the idea that air travel was safe and glamorous. And they were, essentially, just miniature versions of those travel postcards, like little advertisements for the airlines. So, here, let me show you a really early card. This one was made by Imperial Airways in the 1930s.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, okay. This one says Imperial Airways, comfort, and convenience, and there’s little cherubs carrying a fat fancy man in a hammock. That’s lovely. That is not the depiction of air travel in any way, shape, or form.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nNo, it’s a fantasy. And if you open it up, all of the instructions pretty much, it’s all text.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay so, here’s some of this. To inflate the belt, hold the air bottle, which you can feel inside the belt in the left hand, and press lever B upwards with the right hand. That is not very clear. Do you know what that means?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nNo, I really don’t. And sadly, this card is characteristic of the whole first wave of safety card design throughout the thirties and forties. And, to be fair, by the mid-60s, things had improved a bit. You start to see these things called fleet cards, which were almost like spiral-bound booklets that contained the safety instructions for multiple plane models in multiple languages. But that often just made it harder to find the correct safety information because there were so many pages to flip through.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, how did we get from that to the kinds of cards that we’re familiar with today?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nWell, things really started to change in the late 1960s when airlines started noticing a troubling pattern when it came to crashes.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nImpact survival was possible, but not escape.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nDan Johnson is a psychologist who specializes in airplane safety. And he says that in the 50s and 60s, air travel was growing increasingly safe. Planes crashed less often. And when they did crash, thanks to design improvements, those crashes were less fatal. All of which should have added up to more survivors.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nBut, unfortunately, those survivors were not always getting out of the airplane in time to survive.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd I have to say, this is the part of the story that made me throw out everything I had assumed about airplane safety because it turns out that if you’re in a serious crash, it’s not the impact that kills you.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nThere’s very few accidents that kill everyone aboard.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nInstead, what kills you is what happens next. It’s the smoke and fire inside the cabin after the crash. So, the key to surviving is getting out of the plane as fast as possible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI guess I never thought about it that way before, that the important thing is just exiting the plane.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And this is the realization accident investigators had in the 1960s. They calculated that in your average crash, people had about 90 seconds to get out of the plane before it became “un-survivable.” But again, and again, they found that passengers weren’t making it out in time.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nIn one accident, for example, there were 101 passengers aboard, 4 survivors. And the people who were killed were not killed as a result of the impact, but because they couldn’t get out through the door.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so dreadful.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nIt’s nightmare fuel. And it was a nightmare for the airline industry too, which is why in 1968, Douglas Aircraft decided to improve their safety record by hiring Dan along with another guy named Beau Altman.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nI had never been on an airplane in my life.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThat’s Beau. Like Dan, he’s also a psychologist who specializes in airplane safety. But back when he was first hired at Douglas, he says he didn’t know the first thing about air travel.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nI’d never been on one of those great big monster airplanes.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, the first time he entered a proper passenger plane was to give it a safety inspection.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nAnd my first inclination when I entered the back door of the airplane, was where are the exits? And I could not see any exit. I could only see the door which I came through. And I said, “Well, how does the passenger know where to go in the event of an emergency?”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, he started walking through the airplane and he noticed all the doors were covered with curtains. And why were they covered?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\n“Was it just for aesthetics?”', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\n“Oh yeah. They didn’t want anybody to know that there was a possibility of an emergency exit there. They didn’t want to talk about safety at all.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd then, he took a look at their safety cards.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nSo, I looked at it and I said, “This is terrible.” I said, “It’s all in three languages and no pictures or nothing.” It was just read it and weep. And I said, “We’ve got a problem here. We need to teach how to get out of that airplane in a hurry.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, Beau and Dan decided to found a company together to improve airline safety procedures. They called it the Interaction Research Corporation, and their specialty was running tests in mock cabins full of research participants.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nSo, Dan and I did tons of work on how do we get 450 people aboard that airplane off – everybody off, including the crew – in 90 seconds?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd they would start by making each test as realistic as possible. They always made sure that there were X amount of people under the age of six and so many people over the age of 70.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nAnd they have only been given their passenger briefing that it would be on a regular airplane.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd then, they would just toss a smoke bomb into the fake plane cabin.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nThen, boom, lights, go off. “Emergency! Emergency! Evacuate! Evacuate! Release your seatbelt! Release your seatbelt! Get up! Get up! Get up! Move! Move! Move! Get to the exit.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd then, when they got to the exit …', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nThey would be 15 feet above the ground. And they had to jump into an inflatable slide in the dark. And they’d never done it before.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nIn trying to get everyone moving as fast as possible, these experiments could actually get dangerous.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI have no doubt.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah, they got a little out of hand.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nWe tried to provide as much realism as we could without hurting people. We still hurt a lot of people.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\n“Really?”', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\n“Yeah. A lot of people got hurt jumping out of the slides, but nevertheless, we did it.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s for the greater good.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYes. And their tests were an information goldmine. All the participants would be wearing numbered vests indicating their seat number, their age, their gender. And Beau and Dan would be filming the whole thing to see who went where and who did what.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nI figured that I had looked at about 10,000 people over 10 years, looking at whether they sat down at the doorsill, how long they waited, did they follow the behavior of the passenger in front?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, for example, with that thing Dan just mentioned, whenever people sat down at the door before going down the slide, they found that it took an extra half-second per person.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nAnd if you’ve got maybe 100 passengers going out a door, then that’s 40 or 50 seconds.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nBut if you need to get everyone out in 90 seconds, then 50 seconds is more than you can afford.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, I thought that jumping on the slide was a structural thing. But that’s actually just a time thing?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. I thought that too, that sitting down would damage the slide.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nNo, it’s all about getting the passengers out as quickly as possible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that is fascinating.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. But one of the most important things Beau and Dan learned was that one of the best ways to get out of the airplane on time was, surprise, to read the safety card.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. They’re important.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThey really are important. When they had people read the safety cards, and when those cards had the relevant information, the evacuation times improved dramatically. So, they began applying what they learned in the experiments to the design of the cards.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nAnd we said, “Okay, how can we improve these?” And then, we said, “No words, just pictures.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd then Beau and Dan would test the cards out on the public and see if people could understand the illustration.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nWe would say, “Have you got a second here, mister? We’ve got something here we’d like for you to take a look at, and tell us what you think.” And we have to have 90% understandability, or we’re not going to sell this card.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd the result was cards that look a lot like the cards you see today, they used pictures to tell the entire story of how to exit the plane. And they zoomed in on specific, important actions, like how to open a door. And there were also things that you might not consciously notice but which apparently really help, like using red for all the exit related arrows, and pretty much having no text on the card except for the word “Exit.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, I’ve never really thought about that, but exit is the only word.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. They just contained all these visual strategies that nudge the reader towards comprehension. And, as a final little design flourish, instead of getting swallowed up by the seatback pocket, their cards actually fit so that the title would just peek out and sort of entice the passenger to open it up.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nAnd when they looked down, all I could see was “Just In Case.” Intriguing. Just in case. Just in case what?', 'Announcer:', '\\n“This is the ABC evening news with Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters.”', 'Harry Reasoner:', '\\n“Good evening. Yesterday the averages caught up with the 747. Two of them, both on charter flights, both on the ground collided at Tenerife Airport in the Canary Islands.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThe Tenerife crash, in March of 1977 is the moment where Beau and Dan’s cards really were put to the test, because it involved two large planes, it’s still the single deadliest aviation accident in history. Why it happened, is up for debate, but basically, a 747 belonging to KLM, an airline carrier, collided on takeoff with a Pan Am 747 that was still on the runway. And the KLM plane tore the roof off of the Pan Am plane.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my God.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And on the KLM plane, everyone died and that easily could have been the case with the Pan Am plane too.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nIt got very hot inside the Pan Am plane because of the fuel leaking down from the KLM plane into the cabin.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, at a certain point, the conditions in the cabin became un-survivable.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nBut 67 people did survive.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd it turned out that Dan and Beau designed the safety for the Pan Am 747, meaning their card was the one on board the plane with the survivors.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nAnd one of them that I talked to said that if it wasn’t for the safety card, he and his wife would not have gotten out of the plane.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. That’s amazing.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. Apparently this one couple, Paul and Floy Heck, somewhat famously escaped the crash while clutching a safety card in their hands. And I actually have a copy of that safety card.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So, let me check this out. So it says “747. Just in case …” and you open it up and it’s really like the modern card. It has open up the door, jumping onto the slide, the layout of the plane, and it is a quantum leap forward over those lists you showed me earlier, that were all texts. Anyway, beautiful pictures, but really just impenetrable. Yeah. It seems like one that would save lives.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nExactly. And they really saw the fact that there were survivors in Tenerife as kind of a vindication of their work. And after Tenerife, Beau and Dan actually testified before Congress about the need for better airline safety procedures. And it’s around that time that the all-visual safety cards became the standard throughout the industry.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, did they learn anything else from the tragedy in Tenerife? Were there things that they discovered that they could have done better even?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. That’s a great question. Given that some of the survivors said the safety cards definitely helped them, why weren’t there even more survivors? And they found that there are really two big hurdles preventing people from absorbing the information in the safety cards. The first is that when the crash happened, a lot of people just froze.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nSome of the survivors gave us some information on, they were going down the aisle way to get to an exit, and there were people sitting there with her mouth open, they didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to move, they didn’t do anything. They just sat there and died.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nInvestigators at Tenerife found that some of the victims were still buckled in their seats.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike they were so shocked, they couldn’t even unbuckle their seat belts.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. It is pretty creepy, but it’s also apparently common in plane crashes. It’s called tonic immobility, and psychologists think that this is a primitive defense mechanism, because one way to get a predator to leave you alone is just to play dead. And it turns out that this explains the thing that from the beginning, I have found the most perplexing about the safety cards.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\n“Why, in the world of the safety card, is everything so orderly and sort of panic-less?”', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\n“I think that there’s a fear of being in an airplane accident and anything that we do that might increase that fear would probably increase the incidence of tonic immobility.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThe placid faces, the perfectly quaffed hair. The very thing that “Fight Club” is making fun of, it turns out that that is not a shallow corporate marketing decision. Dan says the bloodless design is at least partially about keeping passengers from panicking even more and maybe even freezing up.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, you mentioned that there were two big hurdles. One is that the people freeze up before using the information on the card so, what’s the second big hurdle when it comes to safety cards?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThe second hurdle is something that we talked about at the very beginning of the story, which is that nobody reads them. Nobody reads the card.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBesides you.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. It turns out that the little just-in-case teaser doesn’t really work that well.', 'Dr. Daniel Johnson:', '\\nYou’re going to get a lot of people that say “I am not going to do that. I don’t want to read this. I don’t want to look at it. I don’t want to do anything at all about it, period. I wanted to get to Dallas and I don’t give a (bleep) about anything else.” I mean, that’s their attitude.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nDan told me that even today, only 3 or 4% of passengers ever pick up the safety card.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs this why they now do safety videos? Not relying solely on the cards?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nWell, the videos help up to a point, but even the briefing videos have their limits. They work really well with first-time flyers, but they still fall flat just like the cards when it comes to frequent flyers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, you got the cards and you got the videos, and also things like the flight demonstrations. But I wonder if there’s any other way to reach the most resistant passengers. Have they tried other things to inject the necessary information into people’s brains?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo, there are some other methods that airline companies have tried to get passengers’ attention and they haven’t gone that well. Beau told me about this one carrier, Eastern Airlines, that tried an experiment.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nThey said everybody had to come into the facility 15 minutes early, and then they had to go to this room and they got the passenger safety briefing in the room. Then they went out of business.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nBeau says the cards, the demonstrations, the videos, they all help get more information across to more people. But in the end, the information will always hit this wall of resistance among passengers.', 'Dr. Beau Altman:', '\\nWe try to teach them, we try to encourage them, we do all those things, but people’s attitudes stick and you can’t change that. You cannot change that. So, you have to look at it and say, “How many people can I trust to do what they’re told to do?” Probably 30%, but what do you do? You have to play the odds. That’s all there is to it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, when it comes down to it, if I really want to survive a crash or some kind of problem on an airplane, the funnels that really rest with me, I have to watch the video, I have to read the card, but this is my responsibility to take that final step.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And, oh my God, I’m just cringing. I feel like, at the risk of turning this whole story into a PSA, it really is the truth that we all have to actively participate in taking our own safety seriously. And I still love the cards. I just see them a little bit differently now. Before doing all this reporting, to me, they were just physical laminated artifacts of people pretending to have control in a crisis.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were endearing because they were so futile because they didn’t matter.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYes. That’s the main reason that I took them from flights. But now, and I know I’m going to sound like a goody-two-shoes saying this, but the next time I board a plane, I’m going to pull out the safety information card and I’m going to read it. Note where the exits are, how to open the door, and then when I’m finished, I’m going to put it back in the seatback pocket and hope that the next person reads it too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen we come back, we’ll talk to some of the people who actually draw safety cards for a living and find out why you really want them to do a good job after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’re back with safety card criminal, Mo LaBorde. (Laughter) So Mo, I know that there was some stuff that we couldn’t fit in the piece. And you talked to other people besides Beau and Dan.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. When I was researching this story, one of the things I learned is that Beau and Dan had all these great innovations, but neither of them were artists, like they don’t draw the cards. So I got really curious about who it is that does the drawing, like what actually goes into creating one of these things? So I called up Brock Fischer and Larry Bruns.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\n“When you tell people, this is what you do, what do most people say?”', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\n“One I get a lot is, ‘That’s a real job?’ or ‘That pays the bills?’ I get that one quite a bit.”', 'Larry Bruns:', '\\n“Most people don’t say anything.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nSo the first guy you heard is Brock, and the second guy’s Larry. Together, they comprise Air Safety Art International. And adorably, they are a grandfather-grandson safety card design duo.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNice! Lovely.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And apparently, major airline companies have their own in-house design teams, but smaller airlines turn to companies like Brock and Larry’s to make their safety cards. And they also do a lot of private jets and helicopters, which means that they have a lot of fancy clients, some of which they could tell me on the record and some of which they couldn’t.', 'Larry Bruns:', '\\n“Okay. Yeah. I can tell you, I did Taylor Swift’s Falcon jet.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\n“Really?”', 'Larry Bruns:', '\\n“Yeah. I don’t know if it’s the same one she has now, but I did one of Taylor Swift’s briefing cards.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYes. I confess I was star-struck. I was very impressed, but even more impressive is that Larry is the guy who did all the drawings for Beau and Dan’s first visual cards back in the ’60s. Turns out he’s Beau’s brother-in-law.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, so this is like a “family” family business?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nTotally. Yes. Which means that Larry helped develop the classic safety card look. The retro clothes and the crisp clean lines, and of course, no words.', 'Larry Bruns:', '\\n“Words in a briefing card, just kill me, and unfortunately, they’re out there.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd for the past few years, he’s been teaching his grandson, Brock, all the secrets of safety card illustration.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh. So, okay, we have to hear some secrets of safety card illustrations. What are they? I mean, what goes into designing a safety card, that maybe I am not noticing?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nWell, the big goal is, that grasping the information presented in the card should feel effortless.', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\nSo it’s trying to make sure that it’s a little story and that the whole story makes sense without someone going, “Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd that little story, is the story of how you get off the plane, and it starts with making sure you understand where you are in the cabin.', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\n“That’s one that gets me when I’m on an airliner, is if I’m looking at the card and I look up, do I see the same thing?”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd then they need to make sure that each scene in the narrative has only a few key details that stand out.', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\n“Things like, if in that aircraft, that handle is bright red, we need to show it bright red, not a generic gray or black. It needs to be red, because if that’s the only thing you remember, at least you know what you’re looking for?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo the promise is, if I’m panicking, I just have this glowing red handle in my mind’s eye from the card, and I’m just thinking “red handle, red handle” and then when I see it, I’m like success. Then the next step.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nExactly. Yes. But even conveying that is a lot of work, because all the details you see in the card have to exactly match what’s actually in the aircraft so that the passengers don’t get confused. So Larry and Brock told me that they need images or samples of all of the objects in each carrier’s version of each different plane.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nLike you would be shocked at how many different types of door handles there are, or safety vests. There are so many types of inflatable safety vests. Larry and Brock say they’ve drawn about 150 types of life vests and rafts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI had never really thought of that, but that’s totally true, yeah, it has to be exactly right, or it doesn’t really do its job.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. And the same thing goes for all the different actions that the passengers are expected to perform because they need to accurately convey what each of those actions look like, but also feel like.', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\n“When we draw people, we have them carry weight. Like we add muscle shape inside the lines, we kind of like show them bending and the crinkles in the shirt, so it looks like he’s heaving this raft. So we create the illusion of mass and weight really quickly.”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nAnd that means that they’ve also ended up with a vast library of customized character poses.', 'Brock Fischer:', '\\n“So, in the end, we probably have, I don’t know, we’ve never done the math. There’s got to be a thousand different characters and 985 of them are me. So…”', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah. This is the final safety card secret. Many of the characters you see in their cards, regardless of what they look like on the page, really they’re just Brock. They’re just based on photos of him in a nice pair of slacks and a dress shirt.', 'Larry Bruns:', \"\\n“People actually wise up to that. They’ll start to look and be like, ‘It’s just the same guy in every situation on this card.'”\", 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so good.', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nThis is my favorite fun fact, because when Brock’s body type won’t do, they just recruit anybody, like their cousin, their spouse, their friend, to come put on business casual or like a flight attendant outfit and pose for the cards.', 'Larry Bruns:', '\\n“We, for some reason, recruit waitresses from restaurants that we used to go to when we were in Bellingham. We ask them if they want to make an extra hundred bucks and they usually say yes.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nReally? Just come over to my house and pretend to be a crash card model?', 'Mo LaBorde:', '\\nYeah.

It reminds me of being in grad school in 1994. I was talking to one of my thesis advisors about the world wide web and how much cool stuff was on there and how distracting it was. And he recommended that I take the weekend to go through the whole thing and get it out of my system. The internet was so new that a person with a Ph.D. thought you could literally finish it in one weekend.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nFor me, the dial-up tone reminds me of being a kid in the early ’90s, when I thought the internet was just that thing that my older tech-savvy cousins logged onto to yell at strangers. Now it’s that thing that everyone logs onto to yell at strangers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s millennial producer Vivian Le.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s weird to think about because I, along with probably the rest of you, have been spending about 97% of my waking life on Slack or Twitter or Netflix or Google Docs. But I’m just old enough to remember a time before the internet was a requirement to participate in society — a time before it was everywhere. It was this new thing that you heard about.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nI first heard about the internet-', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is David Bohnett.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nI was reading a magazine, I think PC World or something like that. And I just thought, “Oh, this just sounds amazing.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nToday, David’s a philanthropist and tech entrepreneur. But back in the early 1990s, he really wanted to do something great with this thing called the World Wide Web, because the way he saw it, it was about to change the world for the better.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDavid and his business partner, a guy named John Rezner, decided in order to be a part of this digital revolution, they would found any internet company that hosted websites. The plan was straightforward enough. David and John would provide the online space and some basic tools so that individuals or companies could build their own webpage. And the company would host those pages on its servers.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd because their office was based in Beverly Hills, the name of their company: Beverly Hills Internet.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nIt will go down as having one of the worst names in history.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nActually, Beverly Hills Internet was doing okay at first. It was starting to get some visitors to its website, but John and David found it difficult to get the kind of sustainable traffic that they really wanted, mostly because of one huge early ’90s problem.', '[TODAY SHOW ARCHIVE CLIP]', 'BRYANT GUMBLE: What is internet anyway?', 'KATIE COURIC: Internet is that massive computer network.

Do you write to it like mail?', 'KATIE COURIC: Alison, can you explain what internet is?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA lot of people didn’t really get what internet was.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nNobody really understood at the time, what it meant to create a worldwide web of these kinds of connections where all computers were talking with one another and sharing information. So I had the challenge, both trying to explain to my friends what I was trying to do and the wider world at the same time.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nEven though today the internet is woven into our everyday lives. It wasn’t that long ago that people had to make this enormous leap from a world with essentially no internet to trying to conceptualize what a globally connected computer network meant or what they would even do with it. Before search engines like Google or social networks or apps, the web seemed like this confusing nebulous blob of information. It was a strange new technology that was hard to wrap our brains around.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause David ran an internet company, his business depended on users having some grasp of what the internet was. So it was his challenge to get people comfortable on the web.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nWe need to develop… we need to come up with something more.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHe needed a hook.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd one day in 1994, it just came to him. His hosting site didn’t need a technological innovation. It needed a conceptual one. Users needed a new way of navigating the web. So he sketched out a plan to make his website feel more like a real neighborhood.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nYou would go through what was a two-dimensional representation of a neighborhood where you would see streets and blocks and you would see icons that represented houses. And you would actually pick an address that you wanted to create your website. And you had a sense that you were joining a neighborhood.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nDavid didn’t want people to think of the web as something you logged on to, but more like a physical place to dwell in, like a house. When you signed up for a new webpage, that webpage was your house in an online community of your choosing. This was all a new frontier and you, in a way, a virtual homesteader. David and his team were endowing users with a sense of digital manifest destiny, one virtual neighborhood at a time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was such a revolutionary idea that David and his partner decided to chuck out the whole Beverly Hills Internet name and change their company to something that fully leaned into the spatial metaphor they were creating. They called it GeoCities.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nThe story of GeoCities is just a fantastic parallel for a real building, for something that was conceived of and created to model real life but in the domain of cyberspace, and which ultimately had a catastrophic and dramatic fall in the end.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is James Crawford, the author of “Fallen Glory, The Lives and Deaths of History’s Greatest Buildings.” GeoCities was not a physical place, but he included it in his book because the way he sees it, it was inhabited like one.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nAnd that was something that I think GeoCities was really providing, was creating these communities and then conceptualizing them as places, as places you could go, as neighborhoods on the net. So you could be a citizen of a city, of a country and you can then be a netizen of somewhere like GeoCities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe website was a collection of metropolises. Each with their own neighborhoods built around shared interests. There was a region called Heartland where you could discuss tractor models or Pettsburgh, where you could talk endlessly about your cats, or in Area 51, you could find page after page, after page of fan tributes to Dana Scully.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAs soon as David established this spatialized version of the web, GeoCities really began to click for people. David remembers how in the early days, he set up a little alert to go off anytime someone registered for a new account.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nSo I’d be sitting in my office and it would go ding. [DING] And someone would say, “What’s that?” And I would say, “Well, somebody just registered for their own page at GeoCities.” And they said, “Oh, that’s cool.” Then it would go ding. [DING]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then it really started to take off.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nUltimately it would be just nonstop. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. It was really, really exciting. I would start to hear like… [DING DING DING DING DING]. This is happening a lot and so of course I turned it off because it was too disruptive.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nDavid wanted users who built their web pages in GeoCities to feel like part of a community, that no matter how obscure their interests were, they could find a neighbor who felt just as passionately as they did about Star Trek or 12th-century Norse mythology.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nI think a lot of that comes from my own experiences as a gay man and coming out and meeting other lesbian and gay people and understanding the power of meeting others of your own identity.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nI think people came to it with more open minds and less desire to be performative in how they were interacting online.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was this fleeting moment when users seem more interested in making human connections and honest self-expression than in cultivating a web persona. They just wanted to build something. They wanted to build something dedicated to Dana Scully.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nI was looking to give everybody the tools to create their own content and celebrate the terrific diversity and richness and tapestry of content created by users.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThere were, of course, some limitations to user-generated content. GeoCities was a website that was built by amateurs and it showed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe color palettes of most GeoCities pages seemed like they were chosen randomly, or maybe even chosen with the intention of making them illegible, like neon green text over a neon yellow background.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThere were under construction signs, twinkling star backgrounds, grainy low-res family photos, “Welcome to my Homepage” gifs…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOr gifs of dancing babies.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nIt was the wild west, just different styles and different page layouts and different menu bars. And even, experimenting with menus and pages that were only menus.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nThere was an absolute obsession with comic-sans font. You know, all these kinds of things. Flashing gifs, all these things that almost feel like a kind of early vomiters of the internet.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLooking back through the lens of the flat design and minimalism that came after, it’s hard to click through these pages without having a chuckle. It was a whole lot messier and much more chaotic, but the pages built on GeoCities reflected this amazing moment when people were attempting to figure out what the internet was and what it could be.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nIt’s this beginning of the creation of web culture. And that’s what’s so interesting. It’s the beginning of personal websiteS. It’s translating your life, who you are, and putting it online.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy 1998, GeoCities was the third most visited website on the internet, just after Yahoo! [YAHOO!] In fact, Yahoo! was so impressed with GeoCities’ rapid ascent that they bought the company from David.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nExecutives at GeoCities believed that combining forces with Yahoo! Would put the website on steroids, but that wasn’t what most GeoCities users wanted.', 'David Bohnett:', '\\nUsers had legitimate concerns that GeoCities will lose its independence and its identity, which is ultimately what happened.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAfter the purchase, GeoCities users woke up to a notice saying they had to re-register granting Yahoo! the rights to…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe royalty-free perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sub-licensing right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative reports from, distribute, perform, and display such content in whole or in part, worldwide and or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nMeaning all of the content on the website would now be owned by Yahoo! [YAHOO!]', 'James Crawford:', '\\nMany threatened to leave the city in protest. And as a result of that, Yahoo! actually agreed to alter their terms of service. It was though, the first real sign of unrest in the city. If you like, it was the moment that signaled just the very beginning of the end.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt was the beginning of the end, not just for GeoCities, but for a ton of internet companies around the web. The dot-com bubble had been rapidly inflating throughout the late ’90s because investors were pouring money into internet startups left and right. And just crossing their fingers that one day they’d be profitable. There was actually a mantra that you weren’t a successful dot-com company unless you were losing money.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBy the year 2001, the bubble had burst and corporations like Yahoo! were losing their footing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe internet was starting to change fast. Up until this point, a lot of users had been working in static entry-level version of the internet. It was more homemade, identifiable by those vibrant personal pages hand-built by users. It’s where GeoCities had thrived.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut by the time the new millennium rolled around, the internet was evolving into a whole new experience. This internet was based around interactive social networking sites. You would punch in your name, age, and relationship status, and the site would spit out a manicured profile page. Users were encouraged to write on each other’s walls and tag and comment. GeoCities had created this great spatial metaphor to help people understand the web, but users were outgrowing that metaphor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHaving a GeoCities page began to feel embarrassing to a lot of users, which is basically a death sentence for any platform.', '[TONIGHT SHOW ARCHIVE TAPE: I GOT TO CHECK OUT MY GEOCITIES ACCOUNT. HOLD ON. LET ME CRANK UP THE COMPUTER.]', 'James Crawford:', '\\nI suppose, because we’re so close to it and we know the people who created these, maybe they’re our parents, maybe they’re our older brothers or sisters and we don’t necessarily respect it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYahoo! Stock started to plummet shortly after it bought GeoCities. And year after year, the site was losing more users. From a business perspective, GeoCities seem like dead weight.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nJuly 2009, they send what they call a service announcement, and all it says is that GeoCities is closing and all files are going to be deleted from servers and will not be recoverable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGeoCities was about to be completely wiped out as if it had never existed.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nEven if you look at something like the dropping of a nuclear bomb, that still leaves ruins, it still leaves people. Those people can then grow something from the ashes. This is an absolute existential deletion of existence. It is just taken and it’s gone.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis was the wholesale destruction of a website that changed the way that people looked at the internet. A lot of people believed that these pages deserved to be saved.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd a handful of people decided to actually do something about it.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nThere’s this sense always that the web is permanent. If you do something terrible, it’s on the internet forever. And if you have one embarrassing photo and someone shares it, it’ll never go away. I’m here to tell you that, no, it’ll probably all go away.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Jason Scott. Jason actually has a few roles. He’s a digital archivist, historian, software curator… Angel of Death.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nSo the reason I’m known as the Angel of Death is because I have successfully let people know that when a certain kind of situation happens, call Jason Scott.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThe situation is that a website is on the brink of its demise and all of its digital information is about to be lost forever. Jason’s job is to swoop in and download all of that data before it’s gone for good. And like the Angel of Death, Jason’s face is the last thing that a dying website sees before it’s gone for good.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBack in 2009, before he became the go-to savior of the old web, Jason was noticing more and more that old school hosting services like GeoCities were going dark. He couldn’t stop thinking about all the user-generated content that was being destroyed in the process.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nThe one that still haunts me is this woman who in 1994, made an entire website in HTML about her child who had died when he was two. And she’s got a little candle gif and a little midi song playing in the background. This was her story.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJason wanted to make sure sites like GeoCities and their data weren’t just erased. So he connected with a group of like-minded digital preservation enthusiasts scattered around the world and they drafted a plan.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nSomebody should come in. There should be an A-team, an archive team, that rushes in and makes a copy. Wouldn’t that be something? So we announced that we’re Archive Team, we’re going to rescue your (bleep) and that was our slogan: We’re going to rescue your (bleep).', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nArchive Team decided their mission was to keep an eye out for websites in danger of being shut down. The ones that they say are on death watch and download every piece of data they could before that site goes dark. Their goal is to preserve digital heritage, no matter how small. And their first project, GeoCities.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nFor us, it was worth it because we hate Yahoo!', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut it wasn’t solely about saying up yours to Yahoo! [YAHOO!] Okay, well that was a very big part of it, but it was also about something bigger.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nI also wanted people to kind of get knocked in the head about the impermanence of digital information, that it was both brittle and easily lost, but also with a little bit of care, easily saved and kept.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nArchive Team had a dual mission. In addition to preserving things, they also want us to understand that digital information is fragile. The profiles you build on any social media site, the videos you upload to YouTube, they all exist out of your hands and on some corporation’s servers. And they can vanish at any given moment.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nThey have no idea that it can literally, literally disappear in a week or a day and it’s just… come to it, there’s an error and it’s gone. I get to see that over and over and over again. I’m delighted that they’re making these worlds and I’m cynical about how long they last.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYahoo! had hinted in early 2009, that it would be closing down the service sometime later that year. So GeoCities could have maybe a few months or a few days. Archive Team got to work immediately trying to recruit as many people as possible to help with what Jason referred to as, GeoCities-download-a-palooza.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nI started using whatever social media capital I had at the time. And about 200, I think 300 people in total came in and it was really lumpy.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThey had their computers crawling Yahoo! servers to pull out any piece of public GeoCities data they could get.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nWe were just doing it day in and day out and saying, “Okay, who wants to take this part over? Who wants to do this part? Let’s look for this. Let’s do searches on the web for every noun in the dictionary. Try to find every GeoCities site that mentions any noun.” And then try to compile them into a unique set and then assign it to people to download.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThen on October 26th, 2009, after six months of work, the day they all dreaded finally came. Archive Team watched from their respective computers as the digital city slowly went offline for good. Jason said that watching Yahoo! pull the plug was like something out of “2001, A Space Odyssey.”', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nIt is exactly like shutting down HAL, and we will be like, this set has gone down. They’ve now powered down this server, they’ve now powered down this server.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nArchive Team was still working as fast as possible to grab whatever GeoCities data was left while the servers went dark one by one.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nWe were like, “Here it goes, we just lost this one. We just lost this one. Keep going, keep going.” And we’re just going until finally, it’s just not responding meaningfully at all. That’s pretty much the ending of every one of these stories is us packing up the boxes, putting them on the pallets. So there’s pride that we got the job done, but it really feels like we lifted a piano up 20 stories and then took it down again 20 minutes later. Like, “Yep, we are good piano movers.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it wasn’t all for nothing. In the end, Archive Team managed to extract a terabyte of data from GeoCities. And as it turns out, there were multiple parallel projects that were downloading GeoCities data. A lot of them have sent their data to Jason for safekeeping. Altogether, Archive Team saved more than a million accounts from deletion.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nArchive Team wanted to bring some attention to their work. So they took all of that GeoCities data they’d preserved and they turned it into a torrent on the Pirate Bay. The Pirate Bay is generally used for illegally downloading games, movies, and software. So no one really saw this coming.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nWe were like, we have the hottest new ware for you. Here’s GeoCities. And it was the largest torrent at its time. It broke everything. And when it got uncompressed, it turned out Windows machines couldn’t handle it. People were furious because it’s terrible. Like, “Why am I doing this? It’s telling me I have 19 months to download. Surely it’s some sort of top-secret allocation of information of the darkest parts of the web.” It’s like, no, it’s cats. And it’s lots of rock and roll fan sites. And it’s families telling you that they’re going to have a barbecue.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJason wasn’t sure of what people would actually do with the GeoCities data. But that really wasn’t his concern. He just wanted to make sure that it was safe and available to anyone who wanted it. And maybe if he was lucky, something useful would come out of it down the line.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nI long ago got out of the argument of what good is this.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nActually, a number of people have downloaded the GeoCities torrent and have made some really cool projects with that data. A good amount of GeoCities pages have been restored and you can browse through them online.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSince saving GeoCities, Jason and the Archive Team have preserved a number of dying websites around the internet, from Yahoo! Groups to justin.tv. It’s all accessible on a digital archive called, “Wayback Machine” where you can find over 477 billion saved web pages. The Wayback Machine was founded by the Internet Archive where Jason Scott is now an archivist.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nA lot of time and energy went into rescuing GeoCities along with a ton of other archaic sites from this generation of the web. But I want to be clear, none of this was salvaged as examples of how well the web worked back in the day. No one needs more Netscape Now buttons or Backstreet Boys fan pages. I think we’re good on Backstreet Boys fan pages. The point is, these archives should be studied because our web history is our history. No matter how goofy it might appear.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf the internet’s history were sketched to look like “The March of Progress,” that famous illustration charting human evolution with an ape on one side and a man on the other, GeoCities would be like that third guy from the right, a little hairy and a little clumsy, but definitely an important link that made us what we are today.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nIt’s not necessarily art, but it’s absolutely culture.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nJames Crawford again.', 'James Crawford:', '\\nThis is what we’ve always done as humans, going back to the earliest marks we put on the caves, is you’re presented with a surface and what do you do with it? How do you mark it? How do you represent who you are on that space? And a number of people have made this comparison between the cave paintings of Lascaux and what was happening on GeoCities. And it seems like a bizarre, almost absurd comparison to make. But actually, if we fast forward another 10,000 years and look back, that’s absolutely what it was. It was people grappling with a new technology and how to represent their humanity in that space.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYou can imagine thousands of years from now, past the boundary of the cringy recent past to a future human dusting off an old PC desktop from 1997, finding a GeoCities torrent and taking an anthropological exploration of what’s inside.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nSo the first thing they’re going to do is just waste a week, trying to figure out if they’re getting the colors wrong. They’re going to look at these backgrounds and they’re going to be like, “This is objectively illegible.” And they’re going to check the specs, check the specs and go, “Nope, those people had no taste. What was going on there?” And the answer was, the sky was the limit. So why not yellow on pink? Why not blinking text saying that this is your homepage and then an animated gif with three frames of a waving care bear right next to your description of “Love for Jesus.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis future person is going to discover a tiny window of web history where people were trying their best to chart a course through completely unknown territory, where users took chances and weren’t ashamed to look a little messy or garish or hopeful.', 'Jason Scott:', '\\nThey’re going to see this boundless joy of people who are unfettered by feeling that they have to sell themselves to present their best faces. And they’ll see a lot of lies, a lot of truth, a lot of honesty, but it’s going to come from a person talking to you because GeoCities made it easy to work in the code of the web, but it didn’t teach you to be a performer. So that’s what they’re going to find. And they’re not going to believe it. They’re going to assume this was all a trick. Nobody could be this nice. Nobody could be this forward. No one could be this personal, but they were.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe have another story about a different virtual apocalypse after the break.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, we’re back with Vivian, who brought us that story about GeoCities. Hey, Viv.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHello. How are you?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m good. I’m good. So, one of the reasons why we do these codas is we have all this stuff that’s on the cutting room floor that doesn’t quite fit into the story, but it’s so good that we just want to talk about it. So, well, let’s talk about it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, something that we kind of alluded to in the main piece, but didn’t really spend a lot of time getting into, was the afterlife of the GeoCities data that was saved by Archive Team.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, we kind of focused on the life, death, and preservations of GeoCities, but we didn’t really dip into what people have done with it afterward because the story kind of felt complete on its own, but there’s a lot there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, right. So, what are people making with this GeoCities data?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, probably one of my favorite projects is this website called CameronsWorld.net, which was created by this web designer named Cameron Askin. And I don’t really know how to describe it other than saying, it’s like everything that the Space Jam website wishes it was. I don’t even know, I really don’t know how to explain it, but it’s just a really cool way to kind of click through and view old GeoCities pages. And there’s this theme song that loops around that’s been playing in my head for like the last two months. It’s great. So, you should definitely look at it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnother website that’s worth checking out is called DeletedCity.net, which is this awesome, interactive map created by a designer named Richard Vijgen, where you can browse through the GeoCities neighborhoods as if they were neighborhoods on a city grid. So, it’s really cool to be able to zoom in and see it, like if it were an actual city, this is what it would look like.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s cool. That’s cool.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut one project that I really want to talk about is called One Terabyte of the Kilobyte Age. And it was created by two people named Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied. And it’s an archive of almost 400,000 GeoCities pages.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nI originally spoke with Olia for the piece because she had this really interesting relationship with GeoCities and the old web because she was a webmaster and web design professor back in like the mid-’90s. And she told me that she used to save webpages, like the ones in GeoCities, so she could show her students examples of how not to build a good webpage.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike, don’t use twinkling star backgrounds or a million different colors, or those Under Construction signs that are never taken off?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. Like, don’t do this.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI see.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut she said that she was noticing the shift from web 1.0 to web 2.0 in real-time, towards the end of the late ’90s and the beginning of the early 2000s, because it was getting a lot harder for her to find the twinkling star backgrounds or the “Welcome to my Homepage” gifs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou mean homepage gifs?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nGifs. Homepage gifs, like do not start this right now.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Keep going.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut because she started seeing that they’re disappearing, she really started to study these things, and really love the design of the early web because of what it represented.', 'Olia Lialina:', '\\nBecause of very pragmatic reasons, I started to collect them, just save graphics. And it was not because I thought at the time that you should archive the web, or it can have some historic significance. But then, I realized that it’s not just that some funny websites are disappearing, but visions of how the world wide web should be, they are getting changed.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, when the GeoCities torrent got released on the Pirate Bay, Olia and Dragan immediately downloaded it, and have been studying it ever since. But what I really like about the work that they’re doing is that this is not a nostalgic exercise. They’re really looking at what these early web elements can teach us about our relationship with the web in the ’90s and early 2000s. If you look at something like the Under Construction sign, for example.', 'Olia Lialina:', '\\nOn the construction sign, it’s not just a funny picture. It’s not just a symbol for the old website. But I tried to explain, what does it mean exactly? Why is it important?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, basically, the Under Construction sign was a symbol for this moment when the web was being hand-built by amateur users, and there was this general acceptance that a website could be a work in progress. You could take your time, and it was okay for people to get a glimpse of the building process before it was finished. But that all changed with the introduction of web 2.0, because more professional web designers were taking over, and big social networking sites were taking over.', 'Olia Lialina:', '\\nOn the construction sign, was really the first one that professional designers started to remove from the website. Because, oh, how can it be that it’s something that’s not ready?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHuh? I never thought about that before. The disappearance of the Under Construction sign really signaled this move towards a kind of corporate version of the internet.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. That’s what Olia believes. And this is just one aspect of how GeoCities is being studied, but I thought this was cool because projects like this basically show that it’s possible to apply some sort of archeological lens to this website that a lot of people wrote off as useless.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, it totally makes sense to me. I mean, that it would tell us what we were thinking at the time, that you needed to put up a site so badly, like within 10 minutes, that you had to put an Under Construction sign on there. But you might tinker with it or you might just leave it. Why not?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, exactly. Who cares? This time, who cared?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Why not? So, tell me her project’s name again.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo, it’s called One Terabyte of the Kilobyte Age.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s such a good name.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nI love it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, people should definitely check that out because I mean, it’s like they’ll have a whole new appreciation for Under Construction signs, and what we think of as ugly graphics that really made the web what it is today.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYes, exactly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe whole time that we were putting this piece together, I was reminded of this story that I did, originally for Snap Judgment but we played it on 99PI before, about the destruction of an online community, which was also a really sad story, in many ways.

And if not, good luck with whatever you choose to do and move on to.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs you can probably hear, EA-Land was not a normal video game. There were no monsters, no killing. And although it had some competitive elements, for many players, competition wasn’t the point at all.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nUnlike a lot of other games where you might be shooting people or slaying dragons or something, this was a game about socializing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s Robert Ashley.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nI’m Robert Ashley.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHe produces a very popular and fantastic internet radio show that’s been on a very long hiatus.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nI’m the creator of A Life Well Wasted.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA Life Well Wasted.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nIt’s about video games and the people who love them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd EA-Land was a video game that a dedicated few absolutely loved.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nThe crowd that it attracted, I think, were people who just wanted to get together and sort of chat, meet strangers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was a nice place.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nOver time, it became a kind of intimate almost bar, like the Cheers of video games.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhere everyone knows your name. And at the moment that Paul Monaco, aka Buddha Paul, found EA-Land, it was exactly what he needed most.', 'Paul Monaco:', '\\nMy wife had a long-term illness, from a blood transfusion, she had Hepatitis C. And the last three years or so of her life were pretty much a challenge for her. Well, for both of us. And after she passed away, I had absolutely no function other than to wake up, go to work, and go to sleep again. With her illness, I didn’t get out and socialize much. We weren’t able to go out to the bars and meet up with friends and have dinner. I totally de-socialized myself. And this game was kind of a way for me to just kind of get back into living again. It was pretty amazing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd Paul began to live for EA-Land. He would play it for hours and hours. It was the first thing he did when he got home from work.', 'Paul Monaco:', '\\nYou’re treated to a big warm greeting. Everyone would say hi, and your IMs would be beeping along and you’d be inundated with that.

Now, for a single-player game like Pac-Man, for example, this is easy. You effectively take out the Atari cartridge and put it on the shelf.

All the things that Paul Monaco and his friends love would be impossible to find.', 'Dr. Henry Lowood:', '\\nYou need to document what people are doing in these spaces. That situation is much more like what a historian or an archivist would do when faced with the problem of documenting the real world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, when Dr. Lowood caught wind of EA-Land shutting down, he had the opportunity to record something a historian or archeologist would die to witness firsthand in the real world.', 'Robert Ashley:', '\\nAnd to see what it would be like when an online world came to an end.', 'Dr. Henry Lowood:', '\\nWhat happens when a virtual world closes?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe end of a culture.', 'Dr. Henry Lowood:', '\\nWhat is it like to be there in the last minute, and when it shuts down?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, the tape is rolling and the last few hours of EA-Land are being recorded, and the most dedicated diehard users are there, exchanging virtual hugs and reminiscing.

And at the same time, people trying to prevent them from doing it, people who were heavily armed, people who looked like members of a militia in camouflage.

And not only that, as an investigative reporter at Reveal, one of the things that I cover often is right-wing extremism, and I was actually finishing up a story about right-wing extremists and it was if with these militia members — with the kind of things that they believe, with the threatened use of violence — it was if the people from my Reveal extremism story had suddenly walked into my childhood public art story.

Check it out.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOn January 7th, 1998, an envelope landed on the desk of Larry Calloway.

And I read the note.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe note hinted that the bronze foot came from a statue of a man named Juan de Oñate, seated on a horse. It was part of a monument on the side of a rural highway near where Oñate founded the first Spanish colony in New Mexico, back in 1598.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nLarry figured this was probably a hoax.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Stan Alcorn, a reporter with the investigative podcast “Reveal.” They’re our collaborators on the story today.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo he handed the tip off to the newsroom.

We will be melting this foot down and casting small medallions to be sold to those who are historically ignorant.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe statue’s sculptor cast a new right foot and reattached it. The medallions never turned up. But the story stuck. It got picked up by “NPR” and “The New York Times.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nI was a 7th grader in Albuquerque at the time and what I remember is how the subject I found most boring, history, was suddenly this exciting mystery that remains unsolved to this day — who stole Oñate’s foot? And then there was the timing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n1998 was the 400th anniversary of Oñate’s arrival. There were “Cuarto Centenario” celebrations planned all over the state. There would be theater, parades, a commemorative stamp. In a second note to the paper, the so-called “Friends of Acoma” wrote, “We see no glory in celebrating Oñate’s fourth centennial and we do not want our faces rubbed in it.” In other words, the point of cutting off the statue’s foot was to spoil the party.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd the centerpiece of that party that got a mention in all the foot cutting stories was a Cuarto Centenario memorial being planned for Albuquerque’s historic center. The proposal? Another bronze statue of Juan de Oñate. This one right in the middle of New Mexico’s biggest city.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut with all this new attention on Oñate, the second statue wasn’t going to get built without a fight.', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\nI still didn’t see the storm that was comin’. It was still in its infancy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nConchita Lucero was one of the organizers of the 400th-anniversary celebrations in Albuquerque, and one of the most passionate advocates for a new Oñate statue.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nA passion that goes back to her childhood growing up in 1950s New Mexico, knowing almost nothing about Oñate or the state’s two centuries as a Spanish colony.', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\nWhen I was a child at 10 years of age, I asked my grandmother who was a schoolteacher… I was reading American history books. I said, “Didn’t our people do anything?” You know, that’s how I felt. She didn’t know New Mexico history.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAll Conchita knew was that her Spanish ancestors had come to the state centuries before the Anglo classmates who called people like her “dirty Mexicans.” Or the Anglo teachers who kept her out of a leadership club. And she knew that racism and ignorance of history were somehow connected.', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\nIf we make you feel like the underdog, and we take away your history, and take away your knowledge, you’re starting from scratch. Conversations, you don’t even know how to participate. You just let the other guy put you down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nConchita thought if she could just search out her own European roots, it would help her fight back.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nNone of this is uncommon in New Mexico, where people have been reaching back to their colonial roots and identifying as Spanish since the 1800s. After Conchita retired, she found a lot of like minds in local genealogical and historical societies. She learned how to use birth and death and baptism records to trace her family tree. There was the occasional Native American ancestor, but she was most excited to find branches like the one that extended back to a Spanish captain who brought his wife and kids through the Chihuahuan desert on Oñate’s 1598 expedition. She saw them as having transformed the region by bringing livestock and Catholicism and the Spanish language.', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\nYou’d start finding your family members and you’re going “Wow! I never knew they did all this!”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“Did it change how you saw yourself?”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“Yes. I never argued that one person wasn’t as good as the other. But sometimes you were made to feel inferior. And at that point, that inferiority left.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd so it was that Conchita was on the Cuarto Centenario committee when they met with the Albuquerque Arts Board to discuss their request for a prominent new statue of Juan de Oñate, the man they called, ”the father of the Hispanic culture and our state.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd who the “Friends of Acoma” accused of destroying native peoples’ way of life.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“Was what happened at Acoma brought up?”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“No.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“And was it on your mind?”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“No.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“Was it something that you knew about?”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“I wasn’t as versed in it as I have become.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“For people who don’t know Acoma.

There are 15 families that live up top year-round, and hundreds more like Tweety’s who go there for special occasions.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\nFunerals, deaths, religious fiestas…. We were always there.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“What did you know about the history of your people and that place?”', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“That we came from the underworld, on the back of grandmother spider. We wandered the Earth, and when we got to where Acoma was, we were told this is where we’re supposed to be. That’s what I knew, you know? That we’ve been there forever.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nTweety also knew that when the Spanish arrived, they did terrible things to her ancestors, but she didn’t know the details.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHistorians know many of those details today because they were written down by the Spanish in letters and legal documents. These documents, to quote Oñate’s best-known biographer, “skim the surface of events” and sometimes present Oñate “as he wished to be seen, not as things actually were.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nWhich makes their description of what happened at Acoma all the more shocking. After 13 of Oñate’s men came looking for food and were killed, Oñate declared a “war of blood and fire.” In the most brutal account of the battle that followed, Oñate’s soldiers killed hundreds of men, women, and children, stabbed prisoners and threw them off the mesa and set fires that suffocated women and children who’d taken shelter in sacred rooms known as kivas.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey then rounded up five hundred prisoners and put them on trial. Oñate sentenced those over 12 years old to twenty years of slavery. Those under 12, he separated from their families, giving the girls to the church, and the boys to the captain who just destroyed their village.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd then, there’s the most infamous detail. In a document signed by Oñate himself, it says, “The males who are over 25 years of age, I sentence to have one foot cut off.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHis cruelty to the innocent of Acoma was one of 12 crimes for which Oñate himself would later be tried and convicted by the Spanish crown. As punishment, he would be banished, permanently, from the territories of New Mexico.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThis is the history that Tweety and I, and many other New Mexicans were learning for the first time, as news of the stolen foot ricocheted around the state.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\nThat was the beginning of it. That was everybody’s first awareness.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd at the same time, we were also learning that the city of Albuquerque was planning to build this new, much more prominent statue of Oñate.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\nHe had been cast out of New Mexico forever. And now you want to bring him back and put him on a statue? It’s still mind-boggling.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nHow Oñate went from a banished conquistador to a “Father of New Mexico” that people wanted to put on a statue is a story for another podcast. But the simple answer is he was first. The first to build a European colony in the region, even if that colony was soon abandoned. He was among the first to bring wheat and sheep and Catholicism. And because every people needs a founding figure, Spanish New Mexico made Juan de Oñate its George Washington. Even if he had been cast out forever.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it did not take long for Albuquerque Arts Board to realize that Juan de Oñate was not everyone’s idea of a founding father. They could see that another triumphant statue of him on a horse would be a bad look for the city. So by the time the foot was cut off the old statue on the side of the highway they’d made a few changes to the plan.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThe memorial would need to depict not just Oñate, but also the peaceful settlers who came with him, and the Native Americans who preceded and survived him. And the exact form the memorial would take would be up to a team of artists.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey had a team of two, but right before the newspapers got wind of the missing foot, they decided to add a third.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nWhen Nora Naranjo-Morse got the call, she was in the place where she’s most comfortable – her studio.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“I mean who wouldn’t want to be here right? In this studio with the fireplace and the rain.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nOn the phone was the Director of Public Art for the city of Albuquerque asking if she wanted to be part of a “tricultural collaboration.” It would be the Hispanic artist who had built the statue that had its foot stolen, an Anglo artist, and her, a Tewa Indian artist from the Santa Clara Pueblo.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“The call was so out of the blue. This was a public art project. I’d never done public art really. This was with other people. I had been working solo, so I didn’t really know. I was listening…”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“And did you say yes right then, or do you remember how the phone call…?”', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“I said yes. I said yes right away because um, I opened my mouth and I said yes. And then afterward I thought, ‘Oh. I wonder what this is going to be like.’”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nShe’d find out when she showed up for the first meeting. In an institutional room with fluorescent lighting and a chalkboard, the other artists wheeled in a model of a statue they’d already put together. It was another triumphant statue of Juan de Oñate on a horse.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“And that’s when they began to talk about the granite pedestal and how I could use it…”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“The pedestal beneath Oñate’s horse’s feet?”', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“Right. I felt insulted, I felt hurt, I felt marginalized. I didn’t think I could do that. Although in myself I was thinking that there was a solution. That art could tell a story that was truthful.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNora, quite literally, refused to put Oñate on a pedestal, and the artists went back to the drawing board.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nBut now Nora was in the public eye and soon she started getting calls from other Pueblo people who wanted her to leave the project entirely in protest.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\n“I didn’t do that. And when I refused, I got some… um, I think people were disappointed.', '\\nBut I realized that by me staying in the game, I would at least be able to fight for that voice that I think was so important. Not just my artistic voice, but the voice of these people that had gone through this incredible experience that changed their culture completely. And I kept going back to those things.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe year of the 400th anniversary 1998 came and went. And there was still no plan for the memorial.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nBut the city would not give up. All the attention had made the memorial a very public test of whether the state was the land of tricultural harmony that it claimed to be. And so every time the process hit an impasse, the city just threw more time and money at it, hiring mediators and forming committees.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt one point, one of those committees came up with a plan that would have restarted the whole artistic process. A plan Conchita’s side couldn’t tolerate. It called for a memorial without Oñate.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“It would focus on the coexistence of Hispanics and the indigenous.”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“Well then we said it wasn’t our celebration. You know, it’s your celebration now, it’s not ours. You know? You don’t get invited to a wedding, you don’t start telling the bride and the groom you shoulda had it this way or that way or… and that’s what it was. It was our celebration.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“But it was your celebration with public money, in a public space, that’s in a city that has people of all different backgrounds.”', 'Conchita Lucero:', '\\n“The grant was for our celebration. Not for the Acoma celebration or for anybody else’s.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs far as Conchita’s group was concerned, the presence of Oñate was non-negotiable. Which made it hard to negotiate. In the end, there simply was no single design that everyone could agree on. In fact, eventually, the artists stopped talking to each other.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nInstead, they proposed a memorial made up of two separate artworks. A series of bronze statues of Spanish settlers, including Oñate in full armor. And Nora’s response, an abstract land art installation made out of the desert itself.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt had gone from a small bronze statue to a memorial that would take up most of a city block and cost over half a million dollars requiring the city to issue special bonds. Now the question was, would the city approve it?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nConchita and the pro-Oñate forces lobbied the city council, while Oñate opponents like Tweety, took their case to the people.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“You know, finding out, well who’s for us and who isn’t, and how do we target the people in that area for them to call their councilmen. That’s the first time I’d ever done that, you know?”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“You were like becoming an activist for the first time?”', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“Yeah! I was. I’d never done that.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThe statue, and also a highway the city was trying to build through a national monument of ancient petroglyphs was making first-time activists out of a lot of Pueblo people.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\nIt’s the first time that we really rallied around something.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nActivists, artists, citizens, and city councilors were headed for a final showdown.', '[THIS IS GOV 14. AND NOW FROM GOVERNMENT CENTER IN DOWNTOWN ALBUQUERQUE, THE ALBUQUERQUE CITY COUNCIL.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn a series of meetings, the city council auditorium was divided, like a pep rally or Congress. On one side was the pro-Oñate crowd, mostly Hispanic people around Conchita’s age. On the other side was the anti-Oñate group. They tended to be younger and more diverse — native Americans, but also Anglos and African-Americans, and a lot of people who identified as Chicano or Mestizo, explicitly embracing their indigenous as well as European ancestry.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThe city council tried to give the two sides equal time to speak and in hour after hour of public comment, they went back and forth but not over the design of the memorial, really. They were fighting over something much bigger and much more personal – their place in American history.', '[MILLIE SANTILLANES: OUR COLONY WAS THE FIRST IN WHAT IS TODAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU CAN’T PRETEND THAT WE DIDN’T COME HERE 400 YEARS AGO.', '[RUBEN SALAZ: THIS IS REALLY A MATTER OF DENIGRATING THE HISPANIC PEOPLE OF NEW MEXICO. (BELL RINGS) DO I HAVE TO STOP? (YES!)

IT’S NOT RIGHT.]', '[COUNCILOR BRASHER: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.]', '[CLERK: LAST SPEAKER, EYAL SANCHEZ DAVIS.]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nIt seemed like most people were on Tweety’s side. But if the city voted against the memorial, it wouldn’t just be saying no to this statue of Oñate and the settlers and to Nora’s landscape art. It would be admitting that this whole very public process that had dragged on for more than two years had been a failure. The committees, the design iterations, the debate, all for nothing. So when it finally came time to vote…', '[COUNCILOR BRASHER: ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SIGNIFY BY SAYING ‘AYE.’]', '[COUNCIL: AYE.]', '[COUNCILOR BRASHER: THOSE OPPOSED.]', '[YNTEMA AND PAYNE: NO.]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThey voted 7 to 2 to build the memorial.', '[COUNCILOR BRASHER: THAT MOTION PASSES.]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAfter the vote, Conchita Lucero told a reporter, “I think our kids will finally learn about their ancestors.” Tweety Suazo and other anti-Oñate activists formed a prayer circle in the City Council chambers and wept.', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“We worked so hard. And it just, it didn’t matter. It didn’t matter what we said. It didn’t matter what we do. It didn’t matter that we educated. It just didn’t matter.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“If it all happened again today, do you think it would happen the same way or….”', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“No.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\n“What would be different?”', 'Aleta “Tweety” Suazo:', '\\n“I think Indians, I think Pueblos are just a little bit more politically astute now.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nTweety thinks what they learned was the right arguments aren’t enough, you need the right decision-makers. She’s one of several anti-Oñate activists who went on to get involved in electoral politics. She’s now the chair of the Native American Democratic Caucus of New Mexico and this last cycle, she helped raise money and get out the vote for Deb Haaland, one of two Native American women who just became the first-ever to be elected to Congress.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nToday, if you go and visit the finished memorial, what you see isn’t Oñate on a horse. It’s a compromise. It’s really two memorials crammed into one.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThe first, you can grasp without getting out of your car. It’s more than two-dozen life-sized bronze figures. Men and women, oxen and sheep, trudging up a hill. Juan de Oñate is in front, on foot, no plaque with his name and under the watchful eye of a security camera that may or may not be pointed at his feet.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe second memorial, right next to it, looks from above like a huge dirt spiral. But from ground level, you really just have to experience it.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nIt’s a striking contrast to the kind of art that’s really in your face and didactic and says this is what I mean…', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\nI think that reflects Pueblo thinking. It’s much more subtle. It doesn’t articulate in the way we’ve become used to as, you know, civilized people, colonized people.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nWhen I met Nora Naranjo-Morse to get a tour, she’d just been picking up trash left inside her part of the memorial. She was holding a donut wrapper as we walked down a dirt path that spirals slowly downhill, into the ground. The street disappears behind the berms of chamisas and junipers on our right and left. Then the buildings, then Oñate himself. Until finally, at the center of the spiral, all you can see is the land and water trickling across a rock.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\nAnd I like that very much. Because I think that’s what it was like a long time ago. That’s how I interpret the past.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nIf you sit low to the ground you can almost get a glimpse of a world before Oñate arrived. It’s an escape, but it’s also intended as a confrontation between two totally different worldviews. Because as you walk back out of the spiral…', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\nThis is what you see. The telephone lines, the sculpture of Oñate coming here, looking North, the stoplight. It’s all there. And so you see that in some ways, when they came, they brought us great opportunity but at such a high cost. The brutal colonization was forever affecting to us and I think we should never forget that.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nShe hopes her piece of the memorial will remind people of that, but honestly, not that many people come here. The memorial doesn’t attract nearly as much attention as the conflict over the memorial did.', 'Nora Naranjo-Morse:', '\\nI think that’s why it’s important stewardship. Not only to pick up the trash, but also to keep that story alive. Because there are going to be a lot more generations of people coming, wondering, “What is this?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd that’s where our story was going to end. Until last year, when an old mystery reemerged. Remember that old statue we told you about? The one that got it’s foot stolen? Well, for almost two decades, the foot thieves had remained in the shadows, their identities unknown.', '\\nAnd then one day, Chris Eyre, the director of “Smoke Signals and Skins,” possibly the best-known Native American filmmaker was at La Choza, this great little New Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe.', 'Chris Eyre:', '\\nI was sitting there eating a taco with my business partner and someone came up to me and said, “I have a story to tell you,” as I’m eating my taco, and I said, “Oh shit, not another story.” [laughs] And you know, I heard a few key words but I wasn’t listening intently. And all of a sudden it dawned on me I said, “Wait a minute.” And I turned and I said, “Are you talking about what I think you’re talking about?”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nIt was the guy who cut the foot off the first Oñate statue.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOr at least, he claimed to be a spokesman for the group that did the deed.', 'Chris Eyre:', '\\nAnd the truth of the matter is, that I could never verify it. Other than I believed it in the end.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nChris believed the guy, in part, because he was presented with a very solid piece of evidence.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nWhen Chris met him for a second time, in a forest of piñon trees, he unwrapped a piece of black velvet to reveal something no one had seen for 20 years.', 'Chris Eyre:', '\\nLo and behold there appeared probably a 28-inch long bronze patinaed boot of a Spanish conquistador. And I said to myself, “Wow.” Um, then I looked around and I said to myself, “Where the hell am I? and what the hell am I doing here?”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nA few chunks of the foot had been shaved off, where they’d made a half-hearted attempt to follow through on those “medallions for the historically ignorant.” But otherwise, it was still intact and still had the power to grab people’s attention.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf Chris knows the identity of the foot thieves, he is not revealing it. But he did talk about their motivations.', 'Chris Eyre:', '\\nYou know, the party involved is not speaking from an activist position and doesn’t feel like an activist. This person feels like a historian.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nHe wasn’t trying to start a movement or affect policy, just to write what Oñate did to Acoma men in 1599 into the history of the colonization of New Mexico.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat story still doesn’t have a statue. And maybe it never will. But in the meantime, the “Friends of Acoma” are holding on to Oñate’s foot.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up after the break, we talk with Stan Alcorn about everything that’s happened with the Oñate statues over the past couple of weeks… and it’s been a lot. So stay with us.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so we’re back with reporter Stan Alcorn to talk more about what’s been happening in New Mexico just in the past couple weeks. So Stan, like you said in the beginning of the show here, that it was a really strange feeling to have spent so much time exploring the history of these monuments and then see them come up in the news again. So when did you start hearing that there might be some new conflict around the statues?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo the weekend before the protest that we talked about initially is when my phone started ringing. Tweety Suazo, who had been one of the people vocally opposing the statue in Albuquerque, called me up and told me I needed to look at the front page of the Albuquerque Journal because there was Oñate on the front page. There was a new effort basically to have it removed. And there were people who were saying they were going to oppose it in the courts. And so she was emailing all the same people who opposed it back in the 90s, kind of getting geared up for yet another kind of, like, long bureaucratic fight to now finally remove Oñate.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Where you go to city council meetings and you, you know, you talk and talk to historians and you bring all that stuff up. But that’s not what happened. What happened next?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah. So instead of this really long slog, everything started to happen really quickly. So to backup, and there are two statues, right? There is the original older Oñate, on a horse up on the side of the road.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWith the foot cut off.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nExactly. They had the foot cut off.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd then there’s the Albuquerque compromise where Oñate is walking with all the settlers. And both of these statues, there’s going to be significant protests on Monday. But I started hearing from activists earlier in the day that the county up in northern New Mexico might be actually removing the equestrian Oñate that had its foot cut off.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBefore people even got there. To stop them from tearing it down, they were going to take it down first. Is that the idea?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThat does seem to be the idea. There also was already this presence of this right-wing militia, the New Mexico Civil Guard, that has been showing up at Black Lives Matter protests in New Mexico, heavily armed. And so I think there was fear, both of the activists attempting to pull the statue down, but also of some kind of violent confrontation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. They were trying to make it a safer situation by not having this controversial figure at this moment. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So did you actually see the northern New Mexico Oñate get hauled away? Like, what was it like?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, first it was just like rumors – maybe county workers are doing something, there are trucks there. And then I got texted a live stream, a Facebook live stream, by an activist.', '[FACEBOOK LIVE STREAM: HERE IT COMES, HERE IT COMES]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd I went to it.', '[FACEBOOK LIVE STREAM: SHARE THE VIDEO, SEE SOMETHING HISTORIC RIGHT NOW.]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThere is a bulldozer driving around and eventually, there’s a moment where the bulldozer or whatever this heavy equipment is called, gets its big shovel underneath and just lifts it up and drives it away.', '[FACEBOOK LIVE STREAM: COMING DOWN IN CHAINS.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd did it seem like this was a joyous event? Like, what was the tone of the people that were there?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah. So the tone was, it was pretty joyful, I would say, from the people who are watching on the side of the road. But there weren’t that many of them. You really got a better sense of the way people felt about this at the planned protest because it still occurred. Now, it was no longer really a protest, though, because there was no statue on a pedestal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, it was like a party.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, it was like a celebration and kind of, like, ritual where it was largely organized by these activists, the Red Nation. And there were speeches and then protesters pushed through the gate and actually climbed up on the pedestal where the statue had been before. And there was dancing and drumming and singing.', '[ACTIVISTS DRUMMING AND SINGING]', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nActivists dipping their hands in red paint and putting those handprints all over the pedestal that had held that horse and Oñate until our morning.', '[THIS IS AN ACT OF DECOLONIZATION! AND THIS IS AN ACT OF LIBERATION!]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo that brings us to the other Oñate monument in Albuquerque. So the same day that Oñate statue came down in Alcalde, there was this protest at the statue in Albuquerque. And we heard a little bit about the protests at the beginning of the show, but I want to hear more about what actually unfolded there. So it sounds like a lot of people we heard from your original story, like Tweety Suazo, were actually at that protest. So tell me about that.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, it was a lot of the same people who opposed it in the 90s, had planned this peaceful prayer vigil to happen in the park across the street from the statues. And so that’s the way the protest starts out. It’s that early evening. People are sitting on the grass. People are making speeches. Tweety makes a long speech where she’s trying to inform people, telling them about the history of this statue and the history of Oñate. And there’s a few hecklers at one point, but it’s primarily like speeches, quiet, peaceful affair. But at the same time and really picking up after the prayer vigil ends, there is a kind of second protest. Mostly younger people, activists who want to clearly take more of a direct action that’s happening over at the statue itself.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDid you get a sense from Tweety about how she felt about this transition in the protest style and what that felt like for her, even just what it felt like just to be there back again after all this time, really.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, I mean, I think there’s a certain amount of like, okay, we have to inform people again, but still a kind of like stubborn faith and hope that if people just understand, then they’ll be able to call their city counselors. They will use the levers of democracy the way it’s supposed to work and we can do something about this. But as the prayer vigil ends and she’s driving away, she sees that people are now climbing up on the statue. She sees that there are these members of the New Mexico Civil Guard, these mostly white dudes in camo with machine guns. And she was really worried.', '[TWEETY SUARO: I’M SITTING THERE THINKING, “OH, THIS DOESN’T LOOK GOOD.” AND I’M LIKE, “WELL, I’M GLAD I’M LEAVING BECAUSE I DON’T WANT TO BE HERE. IT WAS JUST “NO, THAT’S NOT WHAT WE WANTED. THAT’S NOT EVER WHAT WE WANTED.”', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nIn some ways, she recognizes they have the same goal. She wanted to see that statue taken down, but not the way that they were doing it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMm-hmm. So this sort of transition happens and then a kind of chaos unfolds. Can you explain a little bit about what happened in terms of the escalation that led to this shooting?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo basically, it starts out with people who are climbing on the statue. There’s chanting, there’s some defacing. There’s tying a sign around it. But things seem to escalate when somebody takes a pickaxe and starts chipping at the, I guess, it’s concrete around Oñate’s feet with the idea to actually start removing the statue with physical force. And it’s a chaotic scene. And I’m reconstructing this from a lot of videos from different angles. But it turns out what happened is there’s a guy who was pushing protesters down. He gets kind of pushed out of the crowd. He allegedly maces some people. He’s chased away. And in these fragments of video, what you see at the very end is he’s being chased away from the protest, essentially. And in the chaos, he pulls out a gun and he fired several shots, shooting a protester.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what do we know about the shooter and the person who got shot? After all this smoke cleared in a few days later, what was the story?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo the man who’s been charged with the shooting is actually a former city council candidate. He’s named Steven Baca. And much as he was carrying a handgun that day, he’s been a very outspoken proponent of open carry. I actually found a post on Facebook where he was showing up at a city council meeting to talk about a plastic bag ordinance with his handgun in the city council chambers. And the man who he shot was an artist and a protester named Scott Williams.', 'Autumn Chacon:', '\\nSo Scott Williams is a white guy. I’m a native American.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nI spoke with a close friend of his, Autumn Chacon, and they were part of the same community of activists and artists. The two of them had gone to standing rock together.', 'Autumn Chacon:', '\\nWe don’t always see eye to eye. As far as our backgrounds, our levels of privilege, our access to certain institutions. But fundamentally, we know what’s right and wrong. And we’ve become very close friends.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo he’s someone who absolutely, in her words, who was a person who was very intentionally recognizing that, like as a white person, he could put his body on the line in a way that other people maybe couldn’t. And in her view, that’s what he did that day.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo there’s this awful incident. And just to be clear, Scott Williams, who was shot, he seems to be okay. He’s recovering. But meanwhile, what is happening with the statue?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah. So they did not have a lot of success with that pickaxe and rope. The statue was still there at the end of the night, but the next morning, kind of similar to what happened in Alcalde, the government decided that in order to avoid further conflict, they would just take it down themselves. So now you’ve got all the settlers and a couple Spanish soldiers and then just a little divot in the concrete where Oñate used to be.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And so in the middle of this, one of things that I started to get tweeted about was the foot shows up!', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if you recall from the story, the original Oñate statue from up north had its foot cut off and there’s some activists that had and would keep it hidden. And it shows up. So what was that like?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, this was a moment that, you know, I did not see in the live streams and the videos that night. I only realized this later. I think when I saw the photograph taken by Simon Romero, New York Times reporter, there was this kind of amazing image where in front of Tiguex Park you saw this black man holding the stolen foot above his head as, yeah, just kind of like an incredible gesture, which I would come to realize that that guy was Brian Hardgroove, member of Public Enemy.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nBrian Hardgroove, New Yorker, musician. People like to call me an activist. Most people know me from my time with Public Enemy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s amazing. And what is his connection?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah, so it turns out that Brian Hardgroove moved to Santa Fe and his wife and daughter are directly connected to the Pueblos in New Mexico. His wife’s father’s from the Tesuque Pueblo. But he kind of just got brought into this fairly recently. He was approached by some activists. He didn’t want to give a lot of specifics which probably won’t be a surprise. But the people who are sort of caretakers of the foot asked him if he’d be willing to be part of this protest.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nI jumped right on it. And all I was asked to do is come down to the park in Old Town to support that rally. And to me, it was a perfect opportunity to show a unity between black Americans and native Americans that we can’t afford to not see, that we have to see that unity. And, you know, black people in America have been getting the focus since this murder of George Floyd. But there are other groups that need the Black Lives Matter movement to succeed because they’re not being heard from. And they need our movement to succeed to give them a better shot, too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo he and a bunch of other activists are making this explicit connection between the protests happening across the country, the Black Lives Matter protest. And then also what’s happening locally in New Mexico. That’s really remarkable, to see that union.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nYeah. And I would say everyone I talked to sees this. They saw these protests as an extension of the Black Lives Matter protests. Brian definitely saw them as deeply connected, as focusing on the same basic underlying issues.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nThey’re the same issue of an oppressed people being forced to accept a continued oppression.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd so, Brian, he talked about how he showed up at the protest, kind of quietly scoping things out when it was still just a prayer vigil. And then at some point at the right moment, someone gets the foot out of the car and sort of orchestrates this moment for him where he can, you know, take it up and just hold it over his head in front of, not the whole crowd, but at least a few significant onlookers and someone who could snap a photo. And Brian described just what it was like to hold that foot above his head in that moment.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nWhat I felt… I was protesting at 20 years old. Now my daughter is doing it at 19. And this is absurd. That’s what I felt. That she has to do this now. And I realized what my parents felt when I had to do it. So that crossed my mind as I was holding it. It’s like when is this going to end.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nThat’s the question, right, for all of these protests, is when’s it going to end? And is this same fight going to keep being handed down from one generation to the next.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nAnd this country has never done things the easy way? It’s always done things a difficult way. And so now he’s got to deal with multiple issues at once when we could have dealt with each one of them when the time was right. Although they all existed at the same time because this country has built on blood of the people there that are now protesting. But we’ve had a couple of centuries to deal with and we’ve never dealt with it effectively, only to the degree of the nation’s comfort. Now the country’s forced to reckon.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nAnd in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I mean, that reckoning is really just beginning. Not only as far as statues, though, that too. They’ve already brought down the Diego de Vargas statue in Santa Fe. There’s talk of other monuments that might come down. But for the activists that – particularly that kind of younger group of activists – they see this as so much bigger than statues. When I was talking to Autumn Chacon, you know, I asked if taking down the statue was a success. And that’s not what she’s after there. She wants to, like, force the institutions, the Albuquerque Museum, the city of Albuquerque, Albuquerque Police Department, to really deeply question and root out their own systemic racism.', 'Autumn Chacon:', '\\nSo we would like all civic institutions in the city of Albuquerque. I mean, throughout the nation, throughout the world. For a start, within the city, to look at how they have structural flaws that directly cause economic health disparities within people of color, that there are institutional flaws that make it hard for people of color to get a job there, to be treated as equal and to be paid fairly. I mean, this is complex. And we’re seeking actual accountability rather than Band-Aid solutions.', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo Oñate may be gone, but from the perspective of these activists, they have not won the battle, this is just the tiniest first step.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSpeaking of first steps, does Brian still have the foot?', 'Stan Alcorn:', '\\nSo, Brian, he does not still have the foot. In fact, he says he does not even know where it is.', 'Brian Hardgroove:', '\\nI have no idea. It’s not in my possession. And I don’t even know the person who has it. So I have no idea. That’s the best answer I can give you. I have no idea. Maybe they’ll call me to show up with it somewhere else. I don’t know. But if that happens, I’ll call you.

And everyone, no matter where they live, what language they speak, or their level of digital literacy, deserves an internet that was made for them. Google’s Next Billion Users Initiative conducts research and builds products for everyone, everywhere. Visit nextbillionusers.google to hear their stories.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat follows is a story I produced at the behest of Google’s Next Billion Users Initiative. They paid me to make it, but I still followed my own interests and talked to who I wanted to and produce the episode to be valuable and relevant to people interested in design. I actually really liked the result. But they did pay me, and I want you to know that, because it matters. This is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe started with a typewriter. A mechanical key was struck, the type lever was pushed down, the type bar that corresponded to the key that was pressed rose up and slammed onto the ink ribbon in front of a piece of paper. It was all very kinetic and satisfying. But there was a problem. With old typewriters, if you typed too fast, the typebars that were close together could crash into each other. So a man named Christopher Latham Sholes created a hack. Instead of all the letters being in an intuitive alphabetical order, he separated common pairs of keys and scattered them across the keyboard so their typebars wouldn’t jam. The first six letters across the top row of Shoals typewriter for Q-W-E-R-T-Y, QWERTY. Typists got so adept with this configuration that even when typewriter mechanics evolved way beyond the point of needing key separated, the layout stuck around. And then defying all adaptive logic completely, the layout stuck around on the computer keyboard as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThen we got so used to the QWERTY keyboard as an input device. It stuck around on smartphones too, even though using a tiny digital keyboard is nothing any user experience designer would design for smartphones if they were starting from scratch. But that’s how evolution is. Unless there’s overwhelming pressure to push us in a new direction, we stay on the same path. The QWERTY keyboard becomes less and less useful over time, but it hangs around until all of its drawbacks accumulate and it hits an obstacle so big, so powerful, that it cannot be steamrolled by history or habit. It hits… India.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nFor Indic languages, and those are languages from India and the Indian Subcontinent, there are so many diacritical marks and ascenders and descenders. Typing on a keyboard like that, I’m sure there have been numerous PhDs written on redesigning Indian keyboards. Because guess what, none of them work.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is Asif Baki.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nI’m a UX Director at Google with the Next Billion Users Team.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNBU initiative is on a mission.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nThe majority of the growth for the internet is actually going to happen around the world, places outside of the United States and outside of what we have known in the past as being the developed markets. Those are terms that I’m not personally fond of, but the idea of the growth being around the world, we have to understand people around the world. And so this team is really based on understanding people around the world and their needs as they come online and developing experiences specifically for them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere is no one single NBU user. I mean, it’s right there in the name, there’s a billion of them. But they’re also spread across the globe and different technology has reached them at different rates, which creates a problem because just like the QWERTY keyboard, technology is built on the carcasses of older technology. And if the next billionth user has no experience with the last older technology, the leap to a new device involves getting across a wider and wider account.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nOne of the metaphors that we’re used to, are ones that are deeply ingrained from us in us because of what we’ve learned from the desktop experience. And I don’t think we realize how much of the desktop experience we’ve left on the mobile phone. I look at the internet and I look at browsers and I look at all the ways that we experience the internet on mobile phones today. And there’s so many things that I just take for granted. The idea of scrolling, right? It’s not the same as flipping a page.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEven actions that are thoughtfully considered specifically for a smartphone can be a challenge for a new user. Take as a hypothetical example, Claudia from Mexico City.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nOr even a town outside of Mexico City.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Claudia from Toluca.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nShe’s new to the internet and she’s coming online for the first time. Or even just, has seen technology, it’s been around her. She’s had friends or relatives that have used that technology. And she’s always felt a little bit of anxiety of “this is not for me.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is something that a company like Google doesn’t want. Because make no mistake, they want Claudia as a customer and making products and experiences that don’t stress her out is a key to this. If they lose her now, they may lose her forever.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nBut yet she pushes herself and she either starts using a friend’s phone or using her spouse’s phone or using maybe even her son’s phone, just to start experimenting. The types of problems that she runs into are numerous. She picks up the phone for the first time. What does it mean to unlock a phone? I mean, it doesn’t have a key.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nShe’s seen people swipe, so she tries swiping.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nAnd so you start swiping in every direction because that’s just the way to exit phones. Swiping, tapping, it looks great, but it doesn’t mean anything, right? So these metaphors that you and I have come to appreciate and understand because of the fact that we’ve learned through trial and error, but still have that implicit confidence. She doesn’t have that confidence.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTo complicate matters further, the ways she needs to use this phone may not be the ones anticipated by the people designing for the first billion users.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nAnd so she swipes right, because she’s told to. It unlocks the phone or whatever it might be, right? Swipes up and it types in the password because many of these phones are actually locked because they’re multi-user devices, multiple people are using the same device.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is just to get to the point of getting the phone unlocked. After this, she has to contend with all the individual apps that may have been loaded on there by any one of the multiple users of the phone. And it just gets exponentially more complicated and unpredictable from there. That’s not to say that there aren’t some designs that just work no matter who was using them.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nLet’s look at Google maps, right? And photos to a certain extent, pinching and zooming. It’s one of those things that you see two-year-olds doing on devices. And because of that, you realize the intuition is deep. The thing about it is that you’re grabbing onto something and you’re pulling out, right? Or you’re pushing on something and you’re pushing it away. That’s just a very thoughtful gesture, which I’m extremely appreciative of. I don’t know who came up with it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut overall, there are very few user experiences on it like pinching and zooming that seemed to transcend age and cultural boundaries. So the work of Asif, in the NBU initiative, is to design things on a foundation of empirical research. It starts with talking, asking questions and living around the people they’re designing for. The key is to listen.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nYou are walking down the streets of Bangalore, doing small-medium business research for a payments product we were working on. And one of the product managers I was with looked at the general experience and was trying to summarize over the course of the interviews we had done for the day and said, “We need to digitize their ledger.” He noted rightfully, correctly, that at the end of the day, the merchant would sit down with his notebook and do some math and have to go through the entire inventory and make sure he understood or she understood, this is exactly how much has gone out of the store, this is how much I’ve made and so on. And for us, digitizing is such an easy way to think about how we can add value because we know how to digitize, we know how to create the UI for it, we know how to store that data and to bring it back. We know how to do all the computation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut when they came back with the ideas to help these merchants with their business, they got an unexpected response.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nThey poo-pooed it. They said I have no problem with the way that I currently do things. It takes me five minutes at the end of the day.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn reality, this wasn’t a problem that needed solving, they said.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nI’m a small enough business where two things go out and two things come in, I know when I need to order one and I should be good to go. It’s not to say that a ledger software, there are actually many in India and beyond where we’re studying small businesses that had succeeded. It’s not to say that a ledger a piece of software won’t succeed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s just that the Google team’s common inclination towards making things computerized was not necessarily the right answer.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nBecause it removes the simplicity from the way that people actually approach their day-to-day tasks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s more to the story after this.', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe majority of people using the internet for the first time do so on mobile, not on a computer. They often share devices with family and friends and they prefer voice and visuals over typing and reading. It’s insights like these that help Google build more helpful and inclusive products. Visit nextbillionusers.google to explore the research.', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe deplorable anti-Semite Henry Ford said, “If I asked people what they wanted, they would’ve said a faster horse.” It’s an anecdote to demonstrate Ford’s genius, and it does make some sense. If you ask people who have no concept of an automobile, they will tell you that they want a faster horse. But what they often don’t tell you is that they don’t want a horse at all. They do not want to be more productive. They want to play games, chat with friends and flirt.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nThey’re willing to give up their meals. They’re willing to work three shifts, work morning, noon, and night, just so they can get this extra data so they can chat some girl.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis Payal Arora.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nI’m a Professor at Erasmus University of Rotterdam. I’m a digital anthropologist and I’ve authored a number of books. The recent one being, The Next Billion Users.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEven though her book and expertise is also about the next billion users. She does not work for Google. Over the 10 years of researching users coming online in India, Brazil and countries in Africa, Payal has had firsthand experience with companies and agencies, introducing technology with the notion that it will be adopted by people in poor countries to make themselves more productive, to get themselves out of poverty. In short, to make their lives better. But over and over again, people all over the globe have shown that the way that they want to make their lives better is through pleasure and leisure. The first project she was involved with was in Bangalore in the early 2000s.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nSo they were these stations like, it looks like an ATM, but it was really an ATM for information — for women to check healthcare information, for farmers to check crop prices so they can be more competitive. Children could learn and supplement their English skills because that was the pathway to mobility. And they were stationed in all these different places.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd in what was basically the only restaurant, they had a screen where information would just flow nonstop, a ticker tape of regional weather data and useful information.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nAnd we had these little vans that we would take technologies to all these further corners of the villages and convince people that, “Hey, guess what? There is something called the internet and it’s amazing. And you’re going to love it and you should check it out. And there’s these community information centers, which you should go to, which is in the town.” Six months down the line, people started calling us, “Oh, great. There’s a movie van coming,” because the fact that we wanted to get villagers to get excited about something they had never heard of. So we promised to show them Pollywood, which is a Bollywood of the South movies. So they would get dressed up and they would all like, “Oh, evening show that some van that comes and shows us a movie and then interrupts us with some weird technology stuff,” right? And then we can go resume and watch the movie again. And it became extraordinarily popular. In fact, I would say that’s our legacy is that we were the movie vans. And whenever we show them the internet, they’re like, “Okay, toilet break, interval, off we go.” And it was extraordinarily boring for them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s not that it was not useful information. It was actually very important information. A lot of it was centered on providing crop prices to farmers, but the farmers had no illusions that having this information would actually solve their problems.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nThis is something I have heard again and again, in many different contexts is that, “Listen, the system is fixed.” It’s like, “You can tell me what the prices are in the city. Firstly, I’m not an idiot. I know I’m selling it way below market price. I just don’t have a damn choice, okay? Because of the poor infrastructures and the delivery mechanisms, they know I can’t afford to go back to my farm. So the goods have to be sold and they there’s a fixed price and they know there’s far more supply and we have to sell, regardless of what you think is information deficit.” So we actually design an entire program based on a condescending worldview, that it was basically the information deficit of these farmers that led to their poverty. And if only we could introduce the right information, they would progress, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was the same story for women’s health care information.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nHere’s healthcare information about how you could have less children. And you’re like, “Sure, I can have less children, not that I don’t know that I can wear contraceptives. It’s a question, will my husband where it, and have I produced a son as yet? If not, I better keep producing those babies until I get a boy, right?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo much of it was social, cultural and situational, but one thing was consistent.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nWhat is completely resonant across demographics, across caste systems was their love for being entertained because it does get boring. You have a lot of downtime. If you’re not farming and you need some form of entertainment. And we became extremely popular because these ATMs of information became gaming kiosks. Kids just loved it, they were using it as a gaming station. And a lot of these community information centers became friendship cafes. Just the fact that they were reframed in the imagination of these users, showcase that these were what they believe. These were the real actual needs that were being met and not the ones we believe they needed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese kinds of disastrous results that came from not understanding the needs of the users is what led to projects like the NBU initiative at Google, whose offices are embedded in the countries where they can spend time in the homes of the people they’re trying to serve and they can experience their needs and anxieties firsthand. And one of the benefits of this intense research focused on one group with specific needs is that when you design things for the most extreme use cases, you can end up making things better for everyone. Here’s Asif Baki again.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nPeople in next billion user countries sometimes have phones that are not the latest models, they’re not the fastest processors. One of the problems that we found early on severely impacted their experience was a lack of storage on their device. And this is something that for us, it’s like, “Yeah, okay, fine, delete a few files.” Right? But in actuality for them, it was a lot more because that anxiety that’s produced by what is caused by a lack of storage on their device is untenable. Because of the lack of storage, which they don’t attribute to lack of storage and because they don’t have the deep knowledge of how these devices work, started freezing their phone, started slowing down applications, prevent them from receiving pictures of their loved ones, prevent them from sharing music that they care about. So many things are just not happening because of the storage on their device.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if the devices are not designed in such a way that the user with limited experience can deal with their storage problem, they seek help elsewhere. And that help may not be on the level.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nThey go back to the mobile phone shop where they bought their phone and they ask for help. And we’ve seen instances where these mobile shop owners will take the phone and put it to the side, invite them back after an hour and say, “Here’s your phone back,” and charge them the 40 rupees or the cost to update their phone. We’ve seen instances where they’ll just force and reset the entire device. And people will lose their information, they’ll lose everything on it, but the devices obviously perform better again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis loss can be particularly devastating when your relationship with your data on the cloud is different from how we’ve been trained in the last few years.', 'Payal Arora:', '\\nFor example, if they want to have some photographs, they will even pay to have a professional photographer take the full family photograph, and then they keep that. So they use it as if they’re printing it out. So the weird thing is a digital copy on a mobile phone is really like a print for them. They formally dress up and they don’t look at it as disposable, transient. So they hold onto certain things which really give meaning.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis tension that the next billion users felt about managing storage on old phones led Google to launch a product called Files, to help people manage and free up space.', 'Asif Baki:', '\\nAnd some of the early countries where we saw immense uptake – Italy, the United States, right? – and so this is where a product that was built for India and Brazil in terms of the qualitative research having been done in those two countries, took off all over the world. But fundamentally at a human level, we all have problems. We want to optimize our devices. We want to be able to make our devices better so that we can enjoy ourselves more.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is the same principle of universal design that is touted when we put in curb cuts for people in wheelchairs and notice that it also benefits able-bodied people pushing strollers or really anyone navigating the city. And this is a benefit to be sure designing for people with extreme use cases, creates products that can easier to use, more simple and have greater utility for everyone. However, designing for people with different needs and those already online has inherent moral value. Meeting people where they are and serving them is enough of a virtue in and of itself. But it is so valuable to have someone new come in, look at the way things are with fresh eyes and different challenges, and really question how we got to now? Just like the tiny digital QWERTY keyboard, we kept relying on for our smartphones. Many things probably already sucked for the first billion users, but like a frog being boiled as someone slowly turns up the heat, we just didn’t notice or got used to it. That is until the next billion users gets in the pot with us and asks, “Why is this water so hot?”', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis special episode of 99% invisible was produced by me, Roman Mars, with music by Sean Real.

We know that these stories are connected to a bigger story and honestly, trying to keep on top of all the bad climate news can be unbearably depressing.

But there are also ways that we can soak up some of the CO2 that we’ve already put into the atmosphere.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nWe’re developing machines to do this, but trees and other plants actually do it naturally. They take in carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their leaves and branches and trunks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so some scientists in Switzerland tried to calculate how much carbon could be removed if we planted as many trees as possible all around the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey published a paper in the journal “Nature” arguing that if humans planted a trillion trees, it could remove one-third of all the CO2 we had put up there in the first place.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nIt was a dramatic finding that led to a lot of dramatic headlines and the way the paper was being described, you would think the trees were some kind of climate change panacea that they were the key to fixing global warming.

In fact, I love trees just as much as the next outdoorsy guy from Vermont. But I’ve also been reporting on climate change long enough to know that there are no silver bullets. And the way people were talking about tree planting felt a little simplistic. It was like here’s this enormously complicated issue of climate change and we’re just going to boil it down to a slogan: Plant trees. Save the Earth.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nWell, whenever I hear that phrase or that discourse, my stress level goes up enormously.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Richard Lindsay, a scientist at the University of East London Sustainability Research Institute.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nEverybody’s saying, let’s plant a million trees. Let’s plant a billion trees. Yes, I’m all in favor of that, but let’s plant the right tree in the right place.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd Richard has personal experience watching a lot of trees get planted in the wrong place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBack in the 1980s, he saw firsthand the impacts of a controversial tree planting scheme in Scotland that ended up threatening one of the most special ecosystems in the world.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe trees weren’t being planted to fight climate change. I want to be really clear about that. Very few people were talking about climate change back then, but the story of what happened in Scotland should still serve as a cautionary tale for our tree planting efforts today because forests aren’t the only ecosystems that store carbon. And so when we do plant trees, we need to be really careful about where we’re planting them and what happens after they go in the ground.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe British Isles used to be covered in forests, but after centuries of converting forest land to agriculture, the iconic British Woodland was largely a thing of the past. By the 20th century, Great Britain was importing wood because it didn’t have enough of its own.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so in the 1980s, the government started using tax breaks to encourage private citizens, to fund tree planting efforts around the country. The goal was to boost the UK’s timber supply.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd it was a really good tax break, especially for the super-rich.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nSo we had people like the band Genesis, they’re accountants got them involved in this. Yes, a number of sort of high profile names who all invested in this having been convinced that it was a good thing because, of course, planting trees is a good thing, is it not?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut questions started to emerge about where exactly these trees were going to go. In order for this to work, investors needed large tracks of undeveloped unwanted land. And there was one place that met that criteria perfectly. It was called the Flow Country.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Flow Country is a vast open area in far north Scotland that looks almost like the arctic tundra.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nThe term tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturia, which means beyond the tree line. And so that really tells you something about the overall landscape. It’s essentially treeless.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe Flow Country is what’s called a blanket bog. It’s actually the largest blanket bog in all of Europe. The best way to appreciate the landscape might be in an airplane. From the sky, it looks like a Persian rug streaked with colorful sphagnum mosses and dotted with little pools of water.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it’s harder to appreciate when you’re on the ground.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nThe majority of the landscape will be this wet, boggy soft, really quite colorful carpet of bulk mosses. So as you walk across it, it’s a bit like walking across a sprung mattress, except you need rubber boots.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. A soggy mattress.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nSoggy is a very good word for it, yes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s the saying in Scotland that summer is the best day of the year. It’s cold and damp and gets an enormous amount of rainfall, but otherwise, it’s perfect. It’s truly is one of my favorite places on Earth.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah and beautiful. Scotland’s terrible weather actually creates the perfect conditions for an incredible substance to form. It’s called peat. And it’s what the Flow Country is made of. The land is so saturated. There’s very little oxygen and it’s really hard for plant matter to break down. And so over thousands and thousands of years, this partially decomposed material, or peat, has been slowly accumulating. In some parts of the Flow Country, the peat is now more than 30 feet deep.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the amazing thing about peat from a climate perspective is that it stores a ton of carbon.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nI fell in love with peatlands because they are these beautiful ecosystems, but they also are global powerhouses for carbon storage.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Merritt Turetsky, or the Queen of Peat as she’s known on Twitter. She’s the Director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at CU Boulder. And she says that peatlands are like these dense underground pockets of carbon.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nSo the amount of carbon stored in peatlands on a meter square basis is often 10 times, 15 times higher than that same area of land in a forest or in an agricultural setting. These are true hotspots when it comes to protecting carbon in soils and keeping that carbon out of the atmosphere.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPeatlands around the world actually contain more carbon than all the worlds of vegetation combined.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut back in the 80s, most people didn’t know about this incredible power of peat. If anything, bogs were seen as unpleasant, scary places to be avoided.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn part, because they were filled with dead people — ancient bogged bodies that had been pickled for centuries in the anaerobic muck.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSome of these bodies appear to be ritual sacrifices from the bronze and iron ages.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nOnce those bodies were tossed into the bog, they became very efficiently preserved. Because of those same conditions that protect peat from decomposition, the bog bodies didn’t decompose.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd occasionally these eerily well-preserved corpses would surface from the bogs of Northern Europe.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nNeedless to say in Scotland, the spooky soggy peatland wasn’t exactly a popular spot. The Flow Country was known locally by an acronym MAMBA.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nFamously. It was called MAMBA country. Miles, miles of bugger-all.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd so in the 1980s, when the forest industry started looking for large tracks of undeveloped land to plant trees, the Flow Country was an obvious choice.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nIt was seen as a wasteland. So the local people had been convinced by the forest industry that this was going to bring a new economy to the area. So of course local people were really excited.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat happened next was kind of a race between the forestry groups who started draining the peat bogs and planting trees and conservation groups who began trying to catalog all the biodiversity in this fragile landscape before it was completely covered up.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nThat’s where I was really sucked into the whole Flow Country story because essentially I was tasked with running a survey program to establish whether the Flow Country contained anything of importance, anything that we should be concerned about losing.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRichard assembled a team of scientists, they packed up tents and camping gear, cameras and food, and took the train from London over 400 miles north to the tippy top of Scotland. And right away, Richard was taken with the place.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nIt was extraordinary, first of all, in the silence.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut pretty quickly he got acquainted with the sounds and smells of the place too. For weeks, he and his team would tramp around on top of the soggy mattress, documenting all of the wildlife in the bog — carnivorous plants, dragonflies, water beetles, loons, and golden plovers. It was tough going, but apart from the wet socks, Richard remembers these long walks fondly.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nBecause you sort of bounced gently along, there’s a sort of squish squish underfoot. And this lovely scent of all the heathers the various other flowering plants that wafted up around you.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd in the end, Richard and his team determined that the Flow Country wasn’t a wasteland at all, but a thriving wetland habitat that had been underappreciated for centuries.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nEssentially, we found that the range of ecosystem types was like nothing, well, really that’s been described anywhere else in the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut as all this was happening, the tree planting was already underway. And so at the same time, Richard was discovering the secrets of this delicate landscape, the forestry companies were tearing it up.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThey plowed up the bogs, drained out all that water, and planted non-native quick growing conifers. Pretty soon little patches of evergreen forests were sprouting up all across the Flow Country. Although Richard says “forest” isn’t really the right word.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nNo, they’re plantations. Plantations established with agricultural densities in mind.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRows and rows of Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine packed tightly together.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd these dense plantations were terrible places for native wildlife. They quickly filled up with predators that scared off many of the birds that Richard and his team were just beginning to learn about. The peatlands were turning into a tree farm.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nSo yeah, pretty soul-destroying.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAs they did their work, Richard and the other scientists were called to testify in local meetings about the forestry project. And they had to argue that this seemingly empty worthless landscape was actually worth protecting.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nAnd essentially it’s our equivalent of the tropical rainforests.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut the forest industry didn’t see it that way.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nI just have this general memory of being shouted at a lot for a very long time. They were banging the table and they were shouting at us and demanding to know what we thought we were doing. To which our response was, “Well, we think we’re doing our job.” Our job was to identify important areas of the nation’s wildlife heritage. And that’s exactly what we were doing.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nWas it weird at the time to be arguing that trees were an environmental problem?', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nOh, that was so difficult, yes. But it’s like everything. A medication is a good thing when used in the right way in the right place. Used in the wrong way in the wrong place, it’s a poison. And that was the tricky message that we had to try and get across.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut over time, public opinion began to turn against the tree planting. A lot of that had to do with the fact that it seemed like an egregious form of tax avoidance, but the message about the peatlands was also starting to get through.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe government eventually agreed to protect about half of the peatland that Richard and his team had surveyed. And then a couple of months later, they completely ended the tax scheme.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nA colleague phoned me and just said, “It’s gone.” And I said, “What’s gone?” “The forestry ground scheme. It’s gone.” I don’t remember. I had to sit down. I was so surprised.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nIt was a big win for the bog and the conservationists fighting to protect it. And in the decades that followed the way people saw the Flow Country really started to shift. It went from being a place people avoided to a place that people wanted to see — the largest blanket bog in all of Europe.', 'Richard Lindsay:', '\\nAnd people were coming to visit it to see this amazing landscape and all of this gradually chipped away at the idea of “this is useless wasteland” and people began to relate to it as their landscape, their precious landscape.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut a lot of damage had been done. Over 150,000 acres of the Flow Country had been drained and planted with trees.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese trees never really grew very well. They were short and stubby and not very useful as timber, but the plantations pushed out native wildlife that depended on the bog and damaged the precious peat that was storing all that carbon.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd the Flow Country wasn’t the only place where this kind of thing happened. Chile, to take one example, started incentivizing tree planting around the same time as the UK. And while they did plant a lot of trees, the effort led to a decline in biodiversity and negligible climate benefits. In Alberta, Canada, they drained large swaths of bog in order to plant trees, again, starting in the 80s. But most of those trees burned down in the Fort McMurray fire of 2016, in part because the once wet ground had been drained dry.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBack in the 1980s, Richard Lindsey and his colleagues were only concerned about the biodiversity and the underappreciated peat bog. But in recent years, as the urgency of the climate crisis grows, there’s been an increased focus on carbon storage in ecosystems.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nScientists were studying the carbon dynamics and kelp forests and seagrass beds, and peatlands in particular have been getting a lot of attention for their carbon-storing powers. You know you’ve gone mainstream when Alec Baldwin is talking about you in a PSA for the UN.', '[ALEC BALDWIN: PEATLANDS ARE CRUCIAL TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd here’s the thing about peatlands.', '[ALEC BALDWIN: THEY MATTER FOR THE PLANET BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY STORE TWICE AS MUCH CARBON AS ALL THE WORLD’S FOREST TOGETHER WHILE COVERING LESS THAN 3% OF THE LAND’S SURFACE.]', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nSo peatlands are the most efficient terrestrial carbon sink on the planet.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Roxane Andersen. She’s been studying peatlands for a while now at the Environmental Research Institute in Scotland. And for decades, it felt like she was laboring away in some obscure corner of academia. She didn’t have journalists like me bugging her for interviews, but that’s changing.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nI think this year alone, I must have given something like 15 or 20 interviews.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut Andersen says that when it comes to carbon storage, peatlands still don’t get the attention that forests do. She thinks it’s because all of the carbon in a peatland is below ground.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nI think that it’s because it’s not visible. That’s why the name of your podcast really resonated. If you look at a forest, you see the trees, you see the vegetation, you see where the carbon is. You see why it’s taking up carbon.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut even though the carbon in a peatland is hidden underground, it’s not locked away forever. Just as a forest can burn down, a peatland can be degraded. It can be gobbled up for agriculture or ranching.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd when that happens, a lot of its carbon goes up into the atmosphere and the carbon sink becomes a carbon source.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd that’s what happened in the Flow Country. Except in this case, the crop that was gobbling up the peatland was trees. When you drain a peat bog to plant trees, it releases carbon. And then as the trees grow, their roots impact the way the carbon in the soil is processed.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nAnd the carbon losses from the soil can actually exceed the amount of carbon that’s taken up in the tree. So planting trees on peat, on the peat particularly, is really, really not a good idea. It leads to unintended consequences of basically losing more carbon than then you can gain through the trees.', 'Alec Baldwin:', '\\nAnd so now in the Flow Country, the best thing for the climate may actually be to cut trees down.', 'Paul Turner:', '\\nIt’s quite claustrophobic being in some of these dark dump plantations. And so when you start taking them down and start opening up the landscape again, in some ways it’s actually quite cathartic.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Paul Turner a warden with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. And in 1995, the RSPB purchased a 50,000-acre reserve in the Flow Country on land that had been heavily planted with trees. Since then, they’ve been working to restore the bog.', 'Paul Turner:', '\\nWe’ve really spent over 25 years trying to repair damage that was done in the 70s and 80s to bits of the peatland.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSome of the contractors doing this repair work are actually the same local people who drain the bog back in the 80s. First, they cut the trees down and haul them out. Then the crucial next step is to rewet the soil. They build dams in the peat to try to return the water table to its normal level and get that soggy bog back.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA lot of this work is done with heavy machinery and it does not look pretty.', 'Paul Turner:', '\\nAnd yeah, you have days where you think actually this is quite a destructive process, but when you start seeing some of the work that we did 10, 15 years ago, it really makes you feel quite good about what you’re trying to achieve with it.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRoxane Andersen has studied the bogs that Paul Turner and the RSPB have restored to try and understand the climate impacts.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nAnd what we’ve found is that when you take trees down from a peatland and do the restoration initially, it releases carbon. That’s not very surprising because of the kind of physical damage that you have to do in terms of cutting the wood and everything else.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut over the course of decades of restoration, the bogs have switched back from a carbon source to a carbon sink.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nSo effectively returning this kind of carbon benefits or climate benefits to peatlands.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut as they do this work, Paul Turner keeps running into the same problem that Richard Lindsay did 30 years ago. It’s hard to explain to people why trees in this very specific situation are bad for the ecosystem.', 'Paul Turner:', '\\nThere are a lot of people that don’t really understand why we are cutting trees down. It’s because surely planting trees is the best thing to do. And I mentioned before, planting trees and the right place is definitely a really good thing to do.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nPaul is not anti-tree. In fact, the RSPB actually helps manage another piece of land in Scotland in the Cairngorm Mountains where they are actively planting trees in an effort to restore the forest and sequester carbon.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the Scottish government is helping fund both of these efforts. Scotland has a goal of restoring over 600,000 acres of peat bog by 2030. And at the same time, they want to plant 30,000 acres of new forest each year. They are planting trees in one place just as they’re cutting trees down in another.', 'Paul Turner:', '\\nIt’s understanding that not all habitats are equal, that not all habitats should have trees on them. And that when we’re talking about climate change mitigation, that one answer doesn’t apply to every problem.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nForests are great, but they aren’t great everywhere.', 'Forrest Fleischman:', '\\nYeah. I mean, I love forests, but I love other ecosystems too.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is a forest scientist named Forrest. Forrest Fleischman.', 'Forrest Fleischman:', '\\nYeah. So I mean, one of the big mistakes that the Trillion Tree paper made is they sort of said, “Well, areas without trees don’t have carbon.” And that’s not true because areas without trees have carbon below ground.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd not just peatlands, healthy grasslands also store carbon underground.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo instead of just thinking about how many trees we can plant, we should be thinking about all the different ways we can maximize carbon storage in any given landscape without sacrificing biodiversity. That might mean restorative peatlands or protecting healthy grasslands and forests. And it might mean planting more trees.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd if planting trees is the right thing for a landscape, we’re going to have to do more than just plant them. Forrest Fleischman has studied tree planting efforts that are being done for climate change. And he’s found that often they fail because all of the focus is on that initial act of getting the saplings in the ground.', 'Forrest Fleischman:', '\\nBecause it’s something that a politician can walk in and do and get a picture taken and be on the front page of the newspaper or be on TV.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut then often in the years that follow, those trees get cut down by people or eaten by cows or burned in a fire.', 'Forrest Fleischman:', '\\nSo this dialogue, it says, “Oh, we need to plant a trillion trees.” Well, actually we don’t need to plant a trillion trees. Let’s say that trillion trees is right. We need to make sure that a trillion trees grow.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd making sure that trees grow is more complicated than planting them. Fleischman says the first step is to stop cutting down the healthy forests that we have left. We need to stop illegal logging and boycott the companies that are driving deforestation.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd work to protect the rights of indigenous people who are often the best protectors of forests and where we do plant new forests, we need to work with local people to make sure that they benefit from the new trees and are invested in keeping them growing.', 'Forrest Fleischman:', '\\nSo when we start thinking about it this way, it really becomes a political and economic problem, not a technical tree planting problem.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI think that people get really excited about tree planting in part because it’s a solution that seems to exist outside of politics and economics. It’s this simple, natural solution that doesn’t require us to pass massive legislation or build a whole new energy system.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut the truth is that climate change is fundamentally a complicated political and economic and technological problem. There is no one perfect solution, but we need to solve it anyway.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBogs are the best. We have so many more cool facts about bogs after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Emmett is back and we’re going to talk about bogs.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, so one of the things that I found interesting learning all about bogs was all the language around them. You’ve got so many different words for bogs', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nBog, fen, mire, moor, marsh, swamp, pocosin.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Merritt Turetsky again, the Queen of Peat from our story. And she says that these aren’t synonyms necessarily, there are subtle differences between all these different words.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nSome of them are rooted in ecology and wetland classification. Some of them are regional.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut there’s also this whole metaphorical side to bog language, wetland language. We use a lot of these words a lot, actually, not in a peatland-science way, but in this more poetic, metaphorical sense, and usually, bog language connotes stuckness.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, like getting bogged down in something, yeah.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, exactly. But there’s a lot of other examples, like a quagmire-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh right, yeah.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n… is a type of bog, and you can get mired in something. A mire is a type of bog. Or actually I think a bog is a type of mire. It’s like a square/rectangle situation. A morass is another word for a kind of marshy, boggy wetland, but also a confusing situation that you might get stuck in.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what is the explanation for why we use these words so much when most people probably don’t experience bogs on a really regular basis?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI think that, for Merritt Turetsky, she says that it’s like even though bogs are these places that we don’t necessarily spend a lot of time, we’ve always… humans have always been fascinated by them. They’ve always represented this almost supernatural in-between space.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nAnd I think because of the mysteriousness of that, not being land, not being water. Not being fully alive, not being fully dead, they are really fascinating to us. So bogs in movies, in pop culture, in literature often represent a place where people can hide from society or where you can potentially get lost.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is totally true in books and movies. I remember in Withering Heights, you have the moors, which are often, are presented throughout the book as this foreboding landscape where they might, Catherine and Heathcliff might get lost or drown. Or in Lord Of The Rings, they wind their way through these marshes that are filled with dead faces looking up at them.', '[SAM FROM LORD OF THE RINGS: THERE ARE DEAD THINGS, DEAD FACES IN THE WATER.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen I was a kid, the one that really got me was the swamp of sadness in the NeverEnding Story. Where his horse actually gets swallowed up in it. It’s just so tragic, so upsetting.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, totally. I almost pulled a clip from that, but it was too unpleasant to listen to this little voice-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI know.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n… screaming about his drowning horse. It’s very sad.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s the worst.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe one that really comes to mind for me is the Princess Bride.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nThe characters are traversing or navigating their way through a fire swamp where bursts flames come up through the soil, and they have to dodge these hazards.', '[WESTLEY: I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE THREE TERRORS OF THE FIRE SWAMP? ONE, THE FLAMES SPURT. NO PROBLEM, THERE’S A POPPING SOUND PROCEEDING EACH, WE CAN AVOID THAT. TWO, THE LIGHTNING SAND. BUT YOU WERE CLEVER ENOUGH TO DISCOVER WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. SO IN THE FUTURE, WE CAN AVOID THAT TOO.]', '[BUTTERCUP: WESTLEY, WHAT ABOUT THE R.O.U.S’S.]', '[WESTLEY: RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE? I DON’T THINK THEY EXIST.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, how could you forget the rodents of unusual size?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, and the R.O.U.S’s obviously don’t really exist, but Turetsky says that some aspects of the fire swamp aren’t quite as far-fetched as you might imagine.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nThere are gasses, some of them are flammable that are produced in these very wet, saturated bog systems. We don’t often see flames leaping up through a bog system, but there is a lot of methane produced because of this really anaerobic decomposition and that methane actually could be flammable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is shocking, that it could be based in any kind of reality. I mean, come to think of it, the dead people in the bogs, like the Lord Of The Rings, that also feels like a reference to the Bog people that we touch on in the main body of the episode.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, bog bodies. Yeah, and so, in general, I think bogs are portrayed as these dark, scary places as we’ve seen throughout this. Usually, there is some truth to that. They are hard to walk through and you can get stuck in the mud, and there are weird gases. So it’s like a caricature based in some amount of real, accurate details of what it’s like. But it also falls really short in fully appreciating them for the incredible places that they are.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, so I have to admit, bogs are my favorite ecosystem. I think they are so cool. I used to study botany in the Midwest. There’s much more bogs. There’re no bogs here, really on the West coast to speak of, but there’re real bogs there. I like a cranberry bog, I like a quaking bug. I mean, a quaking bug is where the Sphagnum grows so thick that trees can grow on it. If you get enough people, they can jump on the Sphagnum and trees can sway from you jumping on the ground. Bogs are amazing, I love them.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I wanted to pitch this story, because I wanted go to Scotland and check out these bogs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m so sorry.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBecause I also think bogs are cool, and then that immediately became an impossibility with the COVID situation. But can I share one cool bog fact that I didn’t get to work into the story?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely, go for it.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo did you know that bogs breathe?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, I did not know that.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo there’s this common phenomenon in peatland science called bog-breathing.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nAnd what we mean by that, is that the surface of a bog, the surface of the vegetation layer moves up and down. It expands, or it shrinks, depending on the hydrology and where the water table is sitting. This is actually an adaptive trait. It means when conditions are wet, the water table adjusts and the whole peat layer adjusts to that shift. When things get dry, again, that peat layer responds.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s not really breathing as in respiration? It’s more like a metaphor of movement when did they say bog-breathing?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, it’s almost like, I think of it as the bog is like a giant’s belly that’s rising and falling as the ecosystem breathes in and out.', 'Merritt Turetsky:', '\\nIt takes on more space and pushes up to the sky, almost like your diaphragm would expand when you’re taking a deep breath. But then that can also contract down and that breath is then expelled.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd this isn’t a new phenomenon. Scientists have known about bog-breathing for a really long time.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nBut it’s incredibly difficult to measure.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo this is Roxane Andersen again.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nSo if you think about it, trying to go and measure how much the surface moves up and down, and that’s in the order of millimeters. If you try to measure that by walking onto the bog, which is an unstable and wobbly surface, it’s going to be very difficult.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like trying to measure the surface of a water bed, it constantly moves underneath your feet. That must be really frustrating if you’re trying to measure it.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, exactly. So Roxane Andersen and her colleagues have been looking at ways that they could measure this without actually going out and trying to measure the surface manually.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nAnd what we’ve been looking at, is using a satellite that uses radar.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo basically using radar from a satellite to send a signal down to the bog every few days, and getting measurements on how that surface level is changing over time. What Roxane and her colleagues have been trying to figure out, is can they use that bog-breathing pattern from the satellite data as an indicator of the overall health of the peatland.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like a doctor putting a stethoscope to your back and saying, “Deep breath.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, exactly. And I think gathering that data could help scientists understand whether a peatland is functioning as a healthy peatland and a robust carbon sink, or whether it’s degraded in some way that you maybe didn’t know and might be actually emitting carbon.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what’s the pattern they’re finding and how do you tell if the breathing of a bog is healthy or not?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I asked Roxane that.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nSo what we found is that healthy peatland, if you like, they have one peak and one trough, roughly every year. The peak is usually, if they’re really healthy, it’s usually going to be in the autumn with quite a high amplitude. And then the trough is going to be in the spring. So you have this cycle of peaks and troughs.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nOne big breath in and one big breath out every year?', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nYeah, and then the more degraded it gets, the more it just becomes no peaks, no troughs, just a flatter line.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, you don’t want to see a flat line, like an EKG. You don’t want that.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, and Roxane says that this new way of gathering bog breathing data is actually really important, or could be really important for peatland conservation globally.', 'Roxane Andersen:', '\\nI think that the interesting thing, for me, about this is that it completely changes the way that we can understand peatland globally because we can just do that. If we spend the time to do the validation, like we’ve done here for any type of peatland, you might end up with knowing what the signal or the breathing pattern for a particular type of peatland is. And you might be able to detect anomalies that are diagnostic of degradation for peatlands that are impossible to reach, or very difficult to reach, that are really remote or impossible to visit on a regular basis.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd this is really important because so many peatlands are in these remote locations, and they’re places that humans have tended to avoid. We’re actually still discovering new peatlands and often they’re really hard to access. So it could be this really helpful tool in mapping and understanding the role that peatlands are playing as carbon sinks or as carbon sources.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, one of the things that I think is really interesting about the story, is that the peatlands are doing a lot of good if they’re healthy. But if they’re not healthy, they’re actually kind of a problem, because they released that carbon that they’ve stored.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, exactly. It’s super important that we find out where they are and monitor them and really are invested in keeping them healthy all around the world. All of our well-being is caught up in that carbon beneath these hotspots all over the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Oh, that’s so cool. Well, I love bogs even more now. Thank you so much, Emmett.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, of course.', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Emmett FitzGerald. Mix by Bryson Barnes.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor the first time in a long time, I’m in our office in beautiful downtown Oakland, California. A couple of people actually still work here. Two people can occupy the space without violating any social distancing guidelines. There’s two entrances. There’s two different bathrooms. There’s two different kitchens. I usually work at home, but today I’m here because our first book, The 99% Invisible City, has just been released into the world. Since it’s a guide to the city, with stories and histories of the seemingly mundane things around you, my co-author, Kurt Kohlstedt, and I are going to use it to explore all the everyday objects right outside our own headquarters.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBut before we even leave the office, just looking at the window, there’s a brick building next door. And the tops of its walls are dotted with a bunch of square metal plates. These anchor plates are a few inches across. They’re pretty thin and they’re spun in a bunch of different orientations. So, even though they’re painted to blend in with the brick, once you notice them, they kinda stand out. You can think of them like giant washers with bolts or rods tying them into the bricks and helping brace them against the facade. These ones happen to be square, but I’ve seen others in the neighborhood that are round or octagonal. In fact, anchor plates like this are pretty common in the Bay area, in part for seismic reasons. They help make sure that loose bricks don’t fall off buildings and hurt people during earthquakes. These particular ones are way up high, where the walls overrun the roof. There’s a parapet up there where the bricks can’t be braced against the main building. And so someone installed these and connected them to metal braces on the rooftop that you can’t actually see from below. In other places, though, you can see anchor plates all the way down a facade. In those cases, they have a ton of work to do. They help hold up entire masonry walls that might otherwise be at risk of total collapse. In the book, we have an illustration with a bunch of different shapes that you can look out for in whatever city you are in. There are squares and circles and stars and other geometric forms, but there are also some really ornate ones like this huge curving S-shape that holds up an old stone wall in Europe. But whether they look good or not so good, they’ve got a job to do, and they all look better than the alternative, which would be, of course, a pile of stones or bricks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you walk outside of our building and look back, you will see a beautiful, black, ornate fire escape. I love that we have a fire escape on our building. I know a couple people on the staff, they climb out on it and they watch the city at night. I never do that because I’m a big chicken. Fire has long been one of the greatest existential threats to a building and its occupants, but fire escapes became widespread kind of late in the game. Back in the 1700s, fire escapes weren’t built-in features, but rather mobile ladders on carts hauled to blazes by firemen. Other solutions for escaping a fire in a multi-story building in the 1800s included parachute hats. I think you could imagine both how those looked and how they did not work at all. There was even this widely circulated plan that proposed that if there was a fire, that archers from the ground would shoot arrows with ropes attached to them for residents on the upper floors to shimmy down. But eventually, we settled on iron fire escapes attached permanently to a building’s facade.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFire escapes are, thankfully, not used very often but unfortunately, this also means that they can fall into disrepair, especially if a landlord is prone to cutting corners. The infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that killed 146 people in 1911, was a national tragedy that spurred a lot of change in terms of workers’ rights. But it also made people look closely at how we need safe and plentiful means of egress from buildings in case of emergency. In this instance, one of the things that caused a lot of the deaths was that the fire escape collapsed under the weight of all the people trying to flee for their lives. Since then, and especially today, managing the flow of people during an emergency is a top consideration. It’s still not perfect, obviously. If you look around the city, most buildings don’t seem to have fire escapes anymore. The newer buildings never do, but looks can be deceiving. These buildings, they do have fire escapes, but they’ve essentially been swallowed up by buildings, evolving into fortified stairs. Fire stairs often double as ordinary staircases used on a daily basis, but they have extra protections and features to make them safer routes of escape during emergencies. So you could be walking on the great-granddaughter of this fire escape every day, and not even notice it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo right next door to our office, there’s a storefront and the businesses inside of there have changed over the years, but out front, there’s this persistent element, and it’s a planter. The planter is kind of recessed into the facade a bit so the edge of it, the front edge of it is up against the sidewalk and the plants and dirt, are held in place by this low retaining wall that’s maybe a couple inches deep. Under the best of circumstances, it wouldn’t be a great place to sit, although I’ve seen people try. But what makes it really, really unappealing is this row of knobs that they have arrayed along the top of the wall. We’ve talked about things like spikes on the show before, that dissuade people from sitting. But these knobs, they look almost decorative. Like they’re painted black to blend in with the black wall, they’re defensive design, but like in disguise. And when we think about things like defensive design or hospital architecture, we tend to imagine obvious things like spikes, but there are a lot of less obvious ones too. Some places have sprinkler systems that are situated to keep people away rather than to actually water plants. In Seattle there’s this one bike rack, in particular, that’s infamous because people started to question, why did somebody put a bike rack there? That’s not a place people don’t really park their bikes. It turned out that this was put there by the city to keep people from setting up tents and camping on that particular stretch of sidewalk. Big picture, a lot of these interventions, they don’t tackle bigger, underlying issues. They just shuffle people around, and to me, that’s a good argument for transparency among other things, because when you disguise something, you stop conversations from starting around it, right? Once it’s clear why something is the way it is, people can start to debate whether or not a given design “solution” is humane or equitable or even effective.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLooking down on our street corner, you’ll see a bunch of spray-painted marks on the road and on the sidewalk. Here’s a fun fact. The first two-page illustration in the book, located just before Chapter 1, is an illustration of this very spot. Kurt took the picture from our window. The colorful spray-painted markings are a guide to all the pipes and wires and tubes crisscrossing below the surface, and they are there for a very important reason. In June, of 1976, workers were excavating a stretch of Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, and accidentally cut into a hidden petroleum pipeline. The pipe ruptured, and pressurized gas ignited into a fireball that engulfed passing cars and adjacent businesses. More than two dozen people were injured or killed. This wasn’t the first or last tragedy of its kind, but the enormity of this particular disaster helped catalyze the codification of these color-coded utility markings. In general, anyone excavating on public property is required to contact a regional alert organization before digging into the ground, so that the different utility agencies can come out and mark the hazards that may be below. The American National Standards Institute has formalized which colors indicate which utility. This is my favorite part. Red is for electrical power lines. Orange is for telecommunications. Yellow is for gaseous or combustive materials like natural gas or petroleum. Green is for sewage lines. There are a few other colors, but those are some of the biggies. For some reason, an infinity symbol is used to indicate the beginning or end of a proposed project area, even though an infinity symbol is normally applied to things without a beginning or an end. Obviously, some colors and symbols are more intuitive than others. But what I love about all of this official graffiti is that for this stretch of concrete, we all have x-ray vision, if we know how to decode it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo on our block, there’s a relatively recent renovation that added a bunch of traffic calming devices, things like planters and bollards to hem in the cars a bit and slow people down, and to make it easier to cross the street. And it’s pretty good. But further up the street, if you go up a bit, there’s a much more traditional and classical and recognizable traffic calming feature — a speed bump. It’s pretty typical. It looks like any other speed bump. It’s just a raised stretch of pavement that goes across the lane, and it’s meant to slow people down. And in the book, we write about a bunch of different traffic calming strategies, but this one, in particular, that I really am into and what it’s called sort of depends on who you ask, but if you Google speed cushion, you’ll get the right result. And what makes it special is actually pretty simple. It’s got these wheel-wide slices cut through it. If you see one, it actually looks more like three smaller speed bumps, side by side, but why? Well, there’s space to accommodate emergency vehicles, like ambulances. For a normal driver, of a normal car, with normal wheel spacing, it still works like a speed bump, but for a driver rushing to save lives, they can breeze right through, without slowing down. Honestly, it’s pretty simple, but I think it’s quite ingenious.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Traffic lights. We already told you about the one in Syracuse, New York with the green on top of the red as a symbol of Irish pride, but that isn’t the only funky thing going on with traffic light colors in the world. In Japan, their green light is more of a bluish-green, and this comes from the fact that their interpretation of the color blue or “ao”, that’s A-O. “Ao” as they say. That’s the best I can say, as they say. The color ao historically encompasses hues that most English speakers in the West would call green. Japan was not a signatory to the Vienna Conventions on Road Signs and Signals, which was this multilateral treaty systematizing road signs, markings, and lights across dozens of countries. And so, for nearly 100 years, Japanese stoplights have been labeled blue on official documents even though many languages would call the color they see on Japanese traffic lights, green. In order to cut down on international confusion, they came to a compromise. In 1973, the government mandated that traffic lights use the bluest shade of green possible, so there’s a color that is technically green, but blue enough to be called ao. If you go to Japan, their green traffic lights may be more… “Grue” or “Bleen”, but still just keep moving along. All as well.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’m talking with Kurt Kohlstedt, he’s the digital director of 99% Invisible and the co-author of the book. And we want to answer a lot of the questions that we’ve been asked as we’ve been putting together the book over the last couple of years.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And some of these are questions that have come up over and over again. And so I’ve sort of distilled them down and said, okay, which ones are the ones that people are asking the most? And we came up with these questions that seem to sort of synthesize the things that people are interested in knowing more about.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So the first one is about the process of gathering material and picking topics and organizing all of the book. One of the things that we had working for us and against us was the 10 years of the show. So there’s a lot of information – information presented in different ways – tons of stuff that’s in the book that never has appeared on the show before. So let’s talk a little bit about how we organized the book.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThere’s this joke I’ve been telling friends — if you’re going to write a book, maybe write it about one thing instead of a hundred things. And it’s a really unique challenge to try to bring all of these stories together under one roof and to figure out, not just what to include, but how to structure the whole thing. Going way back, this is a thing that we first started talking about… like my first text file that has the field guide idea sitting in it is from June 2017. We started to think about, okay, how might this work? What kinds of things might we want to include? And I started writing articles and we started doing shows with that in the back of our mind like, which things are we covering or not covering that would make sense to include in a book about cities and design. And then in 2018, we started to really sit down with this thing and we started working on this giant spreadsheet.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Which was a list of every article that you’ve ever written and every episode that we’ve ever done.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd a bunch of ideas on top of that, and they were all of these different tabs, it was this massive thing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was really something to behold.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then you and I went through and we rated them on a scale of one to five of what type of things would be included in the book that each of us is conceiving in our mind before it’d actually been put together.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. That was sort of this initial weeding out process. Whereas like, okay, if you say it’s a one, and I say it’s a five, maybe we should talk about it. But of course, there are a lot of places where we just agreed, it’s like, well, this has to be in the book. This is a story we need to tell. And one of the ways that I’ve explained it to other people too is, you had this idea, and maybe I’m oversimplifying a little, but you had this idea of including the best possible stories, which is a great idea. I had this idea of making sure it all made sense as a book, making sure there were sort of arcs within stories, but also between stories and sections and chapters. And I think that tension was actually a really productive tension. You were sort of checking me on, are you just trying to fit this in because you kind of want it to make more sense as a bigger thing or is it actually a good story?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. One of the other tensions was this idea of how much to be a field guide that related to what was happening in most cities and how much to tell the best and most interesting story possible. I think we walk the line really well, but it was definitely something we thought about each step of the way. I have a particular affinity for kind of the most interesting story about the most everyday or mundane thing, that’s my favorite version of this. That’s the heart of the field guide as a concept, but there’s so many things that don’t quite fit into that that we’re just excited about, especially new things. Like when you would come back with some research about stuff that we never covered in the show, those were my favorite because if I’ve covered it, I’m like, “I know it already.” And so when you came back with Battenberg and various other things, that was really the type of thing that I was really, really jazzed about when it came to putting the book together.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd for me too, as a person who is a fan of the show for years before I joined the show, there was some fun in revisiting old stories and sort of looking at the raw material and looking at what had happened since those stories were published and sort of rethinking it all for the book, like the Chicago River comes to mind. And we talked about the Chicago River or you did in an old episode.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. That was one we did years ago with Dan Weisman.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBut in the book, we talk about it in a different way. I found some more history to that, that was kind of fun and interesting. And so what we ended up with in the book was this kind of combination of some things drawn from the episode, some sort of new developments in the case and then some more history too. So it’s-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\n… It’s fun for me to dive back into some of the classics and expand on that material as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And it really is a different thing to create a book versus to create a story for a podcast. A lot of people asked us about how it differs with audio storytelling in terms of structure and approach. When you’re writing for audio, you know that it’s linear, you know that people are only hearing it in order once, and they’re not sort of scanning it the same way that they do when it comes to written text. And so there’s this process of reiterating the point, anecdote and reflection, anecdote and reflection, and reiterating a point, and it is something that does not work in text. And it was something that was really clear when we started working with Kate, our editor at HMH. She really helped guide and put us in a direction towards a more written format. It was just learning a new skill, especially for me, for sure.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOh, for me too. And just the leveling up that happened as we got more involved with them and involved them more in the process. So for us, we started out writing essays and it started to graduate towards sections, but soon enough we were sending these essays and sections to the editor and giving back feedback at the kind of granular level. And then it took a long time to build that up into these larger chapters. And each stage of the review, it was like, we would send something bigger and wait a little longer, but get more feedback. But fortunately, early on in the process, we did get a lot of guidance from them about what does and doesn’t work in a book which helped us decide, how are we going to tie different stories together? It turned out I had this idea early on that each story would really clearly dovetail with the next.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And they did not want that. Kate was just like, “No. People will not read it that way.” I remember each one, you and I labored over these handoff final sentences that will lead right to the next essay, and Kate Napolitano was a fantastic editor who did amazing work with us. It was kind of just like, “You don’t need to do this. If they’re going to read the next one, they’re going to read the next one. If they’re not, and if you really mean it that people can skip around and read different parts, then it just doesn’t help.” And it was like, “Oh yeah, I guess you’re right.” I’m trying to think of, if there was one type of sentence most consistently cut, it was probably one of these pithy handoff sentences that leads directly to the first paragraph of the next essay.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And we ended up with a compromise where it’s like, if you do heap reading, you will connect the dots. We’re not going to connect those dots for you, but if you’re reading straight through, it’s like a little Easter egg, if you’re reading straight through, you’ll catch onto the connections between these different pieces. But you’re not kind of forced to read straight through in order to make those connections either, and you can jump around.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExactly. Exactly. That whole process, everything about the process was, I think, pretty smooth, they were good collaborators in a sense. But one of the things that was just really different was the timeline of a book. We do a show every week. It takes maybe six to eight weeks to make an episode of the show. So there’s always this constant churn. You put out articles, there was a little bit less of them when you were working on the book.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. I had to sort of set that aside a little bit.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course, which you needed to. But you, consistently over the years, have put out two or three articles a week. We’re very used to a production process that has a different metabolism than that of a book creation. Having a long deadline that’s really far in the future, what happens with the book, is terrible. And what makes it almost excruciating is having a weekly deadline that runs In parallel to that deadline.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, the only way the long deadline of the book worked really was to break it down into the shorter deadlines and to say, “Okay, well, we’re going to have a version of chapter one by X, a version of chapter two by Y.” It’s like, where do you start? How do you find the kind of motivation to do this if you don’t? And yet one of the surprises to me, I look back and I think it’s so silly, but I told friends and family towards the end of 2019, I’m like, “Well, we’re almost through the hard part.” And it seems so naive in hindsight. It’s a process and it keeps going, and as soon as you’re done with one thing, you’ve got to move on to the next, whether it’s working with the illustrator and working with the designer, there’s always something to be done. And the text is part of that. And the text is a key part of that. But-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it isn’t all of it, for sure.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nNo. Not by a long shot.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt wasn’t just deciding on illustrations in design and in color and the printing, just everything about it was just so complicated and one of those things that we were really involved in, because one of the pitfalls of having a show about design is that the book you make better be good. It better look good, it better read well, it better flow. It better have a reason for existing, that was my main thing, is like, I already get the opportunity to tell millions of people stories about design, so why should a book exist? And what can it do that the show can’t do? And that’s something that we were constantly thinking about, of how to exploit those differences between a book and a podcast and a website. And so all those things required so much thought, so much so that I think HMH was shocked at the level of detail, especially you were writing them.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. They’re used to authors, authors are authoring, right?. They’re writing, they’re doing the text stuff, but of course, we’re interested in design. So we want to work with the designer, we want to work with the illustrator, we want to make this a designed object. And I have this background in architecture, and so I’m not a great designer, but I at least like the process and know how it works. And so a lot of it was sort of navigating this challenging thing, which you always have to navigate with designers, which is to say, figure out what their strengths are. So we spent, for example, a lot of time looking at the portfolios of both Patrick Vale and Rafael Geroni who are the illustrator and designer of the book, and saying, “Okay. How can we lean into their strengths? How can we sort of give them the freedom to do what they do well, but make sure we also cover the things that we need to cover in the course of this design process?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So when we went through and took every story we’ve ever told in whatever format, and we put it into a big spreadsheet and rank them from one to five about what to include in the book, we both quickly settled on the first one being the official graffiti. It had an explosion, it seemed like a good thing that people would see everywhere, there was a story behind it, we could teach people how to decode it in ways that were really fun and obvious. And so I remember that being one of the first ones we settled on, this leads me to one of the last ones we included. So there was a drama in San Francisco with these boulders, which is in chapter six, which is really the last story that we included at all. And I remember you asking me, “Is this worth it?” You were pretty bedraggled and tired from the other 400 pages of writing.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI also was worried, I was like, is the publisher going to say, “Guys, you have to stop adding stuff, please.” And so I was like, can we convince them to just sneak this one last piece in?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it sort of encapsulated so much of what we were talking about already in chapter six, that it was just like, yeah, I think we got to do it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd one of the questions that we’ve gotten asked too is, what’s your favorite piece? And that’s hard to nail down. I really like the first piece in the book. I do think it sort of captures the essence of the book really well, but in some ways, some of my favorite pieces are the ones I had to fight for.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo there was some consideration of cutting a few pieces. One of which was the piece about standardized time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Right. This was the story of how different towns had to finally start coordinating their clocks because the train was coming and they had to get on the same schedule.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd what I realized sort of going back over this is that it wasn’t super clear. It was probably too long. I could see how it wasn’t working, but I really thought that the ideas in it were worth keeping and that it was a story worth telling just in shorter form. And so it became one of my favorites because it became one I had to work on in order to justify keeping it in the book, basically.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I remember us sitting at my kitchen table and us going over that one and me being one of the naysayers who just was like, “This is too complicated. People can’t do math in this way.” And asking you questions about, why is this important? And having you, obviously, just come through with it. And I remember, I had more recently had the deep dive with the book because I’ve been reading it in the studio out loud. And that’s a great section. It really works. You did a great job making that relevant and not complicated and make people understand what it really meant to standardize time when this was not a concern of people at all for millennia.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And I remember that conversation too. And it was like, I got it. I understood why I was so attached to it. But I basically needed you to talk to and you just say, “Okay. Just explain it to me. Don’t read it, just explain it to me.” And once I did it, you saw the kind of passion I had for it. I think we both realized, okay, there’s something here, it’s just not fully on the page right now. So it’s like, we got to go back to the drawing board a bit and figure out how to simplify this and streamline this so that it’s just a compelling story.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd that’s what we tried to do for every story over and over again, page after page while putting this book together. And it comes out today. First of all, I want to thank Kurt Kohlstedt for working so hard on every aspect of this book, his talent and attention to detail is unparalleled.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor a lot of people, being a professional baseball player sounds like a total dream job. I mean, you get paid millions of dollars to play a game, but there are downsides. Like if you have a bad night at work as a baseball player, it’s usually in front of 40,000 screaming fans.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThis story is about one of those nights in Houston, Texas. The Toronto Blue Jays were losing to the hometown Astros. When they called in pitcher Mike Bolsinger.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s baseball reporter, Ben Reiter. He covered the game for 15 years as a writer at Sports Illustrated.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nSome Major League Baseball players have job security and $20 million salaries. They are paid huge bonuses just for getting drafted and their teams have spent years developing them. Then there are guys like Bolsinger.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\n“I signed for $1,000 with a billion-dollar organization.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\n“$1,000?”', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\n“I think it was $667 after taxes.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\n“So they don’t have that much invested in you.”', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\n“You can make jokes about it. It’s like a bucket of baseballs for them.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe night Bolsinger came in, he was facing a stacked Astros lineup. They had star players like Alex Bregman and Carlos Beltran. They were a total juggernaut.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nOh yeah. I mean, they were unbelievable. From what you see, the runs they were putting up. In my head, I was like, “This is the best team in baseball.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBolsinger came into the game with a man on first and two outs. All he had to do was get one more out and the inning was over.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nJust get one out. I mean, in theory, it should be easy.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nBut instead, Bolsinger walked his first batter. The second hit a three-run homer. Then the Astros really started pouring it on.', 'Sports Announcer', '\\n[Carlos Beltran jumps on the first pitch.]', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nThey just kept getting hits, laying off pitches. I’m trying to remember a time I was rocked more than that and I just don’t remember a time.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nMike Bolsinger was stressed. He was a journeyman. One bad outing could be the difference between hanging on to his job or being sent down to the minor leagues. His major league career hung in the balance every single time he took the mound. The eighth batter he faced was Alex Bregman. With the bases loaded Bolsinger was desperate not to give up another home run. So he turned to his best pitch, his slow looping curveball, but Bregman was ready for it. And he hit it deep.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nAt that point, I was like, “Well, what else is new? Everyone else is hitting everything off me, might as well just go over the fence.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe ball kept going and going and going. And actually, the Blue Jays caught it. Bolsinger got his one out and the inning was finally over. It had gone just about as badly as an inning can possibly go.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nMike Bolsinger gave up four runs on four hits and three walks. He was stunned by what happened. He felt good that day. He was throwing good pitches, but the Astros just kept hitting them.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nI remember in the interview, after the game, I told the reporter, I was like, “Man, it was like they knew what I was throwing. They were all over my stuff. There’s nothing I could do.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMike Bolsinger was demoted to the minor leagues that night, like right after the game was over. And he stayed in the minor leagues. After 2017, he played a few seasons in Japan, but he would never pitch in the big leagues again.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nBolsinger had a lot of time to replay that final inning in his head. He thought he’d thrown the ball well against the Astros. His arm felt good. His velocity was normal. His curve ball was biting. It just hadn’t mattered.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt turns out there was a reason the Houston Astros hitters seemed like they knew exactly what pitches Bolsinger was going to throw and that’s because they did. And they knew because the Astros were engaged in an age-old practice called sign stealing. They were cheating. Baseball is a game with a ton of nonverbal communication between players and coaches. All of which happens out in the open. Coaches will swipe their hands across their chest and down their legs to tell a player to steal the base or lay off a pitch. Infielders will wave at each other to move over a couple of feet to the left or to the right. There are thousands of moments like this in every game.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nAnd the most important non-verbal communication is between the pitcher and the catcher. The catcher is responsible for knowing the opposing hitter’s strengths and weaknesses, and for suggesting what pitches to throw. He does it using a system of discrete hand signals. If you’ve seen a baseball game, you’ve seen this happen. The catcher crouches down, he puts one hand between the shin guards and he starts pointing his fingers towards the dirt.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne finger means throw a fastball. Two is a curveball. Teams will mix up their signs like when a runner is on second, who has a clear view of the catcher. But for the most part, this is just how it’s done.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nIf a batter knows what pitch is coming, it’s a lot easier to get on base because that knowledge means they can figure out exactly when to swing or let a pitch go. Here’s Mike Bolsinger', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nI think the hardest thing to do in any sport is to hit a baseball. So a pitcher already has an advantage right there, but a hitter not knowing what you’re going to throw or where you’re going to throw it… I mean, It’s almost like hitting, unless you’re extremely good at it, it’s a guessing game.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThis is where sign-stealing comes in. If you can decode an opposing pitcher’s signs, you have a big competitive advantage.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSign stealing is a two-step process. First, someone has to see the catcher’s signals, and then they have to communicate that information to the batter and this whole process has to take place in a matter of seconds. This may sound like a lot of effort, but as long as there have been nonverbal signs in baseball, crafty players have been stealing them.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nIn the early days of baseball, sign stealing was almost like a game within the game. Teams and players would try all kinds of tricks to get a glimpse of what the catcher was signaling to the pitcher.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nThe axiom which I heard many times, if you’re not stealing, you’re not trying.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThat’s Paul Dickson, the author of “The Hidden Language of Baseball.” He says the first recorded instance of sign stealing goes all the way back to 1876, the very first year of the National League.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nThere was a shack that had been built hanging from a telegraph pole overlooking the stadium in Hartford.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe shack was hidden away from fans almost like a hunting blind. Details are sketchy because this happened in 1876, but apparently, there was a man hiding in the shack, probably with a pair of binoculars.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nAnd they were stealing the sign from there and getting them somehow down to the guys on the field. And they were taking it from there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn those early days, sign stealing wasn’t against the rules of baseball. There was no clear line that teams knew not to cross. Lots of people considered it cheating, but much like in “Air Bud”, there was nothing in the rule book that outlawed a dog from playing basketball, nothing in the rule book stopped players from building a shack on a telegraph pole and spying on the other teams with binoculars.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe sign dealing arms race may have had some big impacts on the game. Catchers in baseball used to lean over to receive pitches, but that made it too easy for other teams to steal their signs. So it’s believed that that’s why catchers began to squat.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’ve also been some more outlandish and creative efforts like in 1900, there was an incident during a game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe Red’s shortstop, Tommy Corcoran, noticed the Phillies third base coach was always putting his foot in a specific patch of dirt on the field just before a pitch was coming in and Corcoran thought something’s wrong here.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nHe goes tearing across the field and starts kicking with his foot, digging up the dirt and dirt is flying everywhere. And he comes with his little box and in the box is a buzzer.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCorcoran discovered that the Philly’s coach had been stepping on the buzzer box.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nAnd the buzzer is taking a telegraphed signal and buzzing, but it’s not loud enough to be heard, but he could feel it at the bottom of his foot.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nIt turned out the Philly’s coach was receiving a modified Morse code to tell him what pitch was coming. The message was coming from a Phillies player who was using binoculars to look through a peephole in the outfield fence to watch the other team’s signs. The player relayed those signs to the coach using the buzzer. And then the coach sent that message to the batter. Again, this might sound like way too much effort to steal signs, but every team was looking for even the smallest edge to win ballgames.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it worked. Sign stealing probably helped the team win the World Series in 1948. Bob Feller, a hall of fame pitcher for the Cleveland team, used the telescope he brought back from World War II to pick up signs. They won the championship and Feller was pretty unrepentant about it.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nLater he said, “Hey, all’s fair in love and war and when you’re trying to win a pennant.”', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[And the 1948 world series is all over.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSign stealing occupied a gray zone in baseball ethics. On one hand, players were hiding it from their opponents and from fans. On the other, everybody knew it was happening. One player, a Hall of Famer named Rogers Hornsby did an interview with True Magazine that was published under the headline “You’ve Got to Cheat to Win in Baseball.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nBecause of this ethical gray area, for years it went like this — a team would be caught sign stealing. The other team would say, “Hey, cut it out.” And then they would come up with a new way of doing it. For years, Major League Baseball did nothing, but their view on sign stealing changed after a technological breakthrough in the 1950s. NBC had just invested in a camera with an 80-inch Spacemaster telephoto lens and unveiled it for a game of the week.', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[Begin the scene here today. Now Alan Bill with Red Barber and I are all set to send it your way…]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe broadcasters realize that they can now clearly see the catcher’s signs and told the audience what was coming before each pitch.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nOne of the people who happened to be watching the game that day was the commissioner, who was Ford Frick at the time, and he thought it was a horrible idea. He immediately went to NBC to agree not to use the camera again, ever. If the guys in the booth could pick it up, the dugout could have the TV on.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1962, the commissioner took a baby step to discourage sign stealing.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nFrick said publicly that he would overturn any game if it was proven the winning team had stolen signs using mechanical means, like a camera or a buzzer system or even binoculars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis was the line in the sand in terms of baseball ethics. Players were allowed to steal with their eyes because that was considered a skill, but you couldn’t steal signs using technology.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nFrick never actually punished anybody for sign stealing. And it took Major League Baseball 40 years to make an official rule about it. In 2000, they finally banned signed stealing by electronic means. They had to do it because technology was moving so quickly at that point.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe 2000 rule was meant to stop cell phones from being used to steal signs. But by the early 2010s, baseball clubhouses were filled with video screens. Some of them were installed by the league itself when they started allowing teams to use video replay to challenge umpire’s calls. The presence of all these new screens made cheating incredibly tempting.', 'Paul Dickson:', '\\nMajor League Baseball brought the snake into the garden of Eden. And then we’re surprised when the players took a bite of the apple.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nAfter a century of back and forth, by the 2010s, there was finally a clear line in the rules of baseball. Sign stealing using technology was not okay, but with screens everywhere, it felt like a matter of time before someone crossed that line and got caught doing it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBefore they were winning games and sending opposing pitchers back to the minor leagues, the Houston Astros were one of the worst teams in the history of baseball. Starting in 2011, they lost 100 games three years in a row. Some of their games had local TV ratings of 0.0, which meant that Nielsen couldn’t confirm a single Houstonian who watched the games. They earned nicknames like the Lastros and the Disastros, which are pretty good.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nTo turn things around, the Astros took a page from the Moneyball playbook and hired a fleet of math nerds. They worked on sophisticated algorithms that would help the Astros decide which players to draft and what strategies to execute on the field. The stats team was called the Nerd Cave.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“And so Ben, you know this because you actually covered the Astros firsthand.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\n“Yeah, I did. So in 2014, I spent a lot of time in the team’s front office for a story for Sports Illustrated. And when I got there, I found I was really impressed with what I saw. I came away convinced that they were on the path to turning things around. So before the story ran, my editor asks me to estimate the year it’s all going to come together. And I gave him my best guess. So at the end of 2014, the issue containing my piece hit mailboxes across the country with a cover that reads: Your 2017 World Series Champs. Turns out I was right.”', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[High fly ball to left field. Good. Walk it off, George Springer. Deep drive, right field. This is going to soar… grand slam!]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn October 2017, Mike Bolsinger was sitting at a bar watching the Houston Astros play game seven of the World Series. This was only three months after his final Major League Game. The Astros were playing one of Bolsinger’s old teams, the LA Dodgers.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\n“The Dodgers, you know, I love every single one of them. It was the greatest organization I ever played for. So I wanted them to win.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\n“But you felt the Astros deserved it.”', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\n“Oh, I mean, yeah. 100%. I mean, I think to me, they had the better lineup. It is what it is.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nMike Bolsinger had mixed emotions about the whole series. He respected the Astros for their talent and baseball fans everywhere were rooting for them. The Astros weren’t just winners, they were likable winners. They were playing in Houston’s second World Series ever. And they made it the same year hurricane Harvey devastated their home city. Their stars, like Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman, were fun to watch. It was a real Cinderella story.', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[The Sports Illustrated cover in 2014 and the article by Ben Reiter, they nailed it.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“Hey, that’s you?”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\n“Yeah. Although, they kept pronouncing my name wrong.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnyhow, the Astros were champions.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nIf you have a lineup like that, if you’re hitting the ball like that, putting up numbers like that, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t win. You know, when you have a good pitching and you’re putting up 10 plus runs a game, it feels like, how can you lose?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nMe, Mike Bolsinger, and almost everybody else assumed the Astros took the World Series because of their mix of young talent and the shrewd decision-making from the Nerd Cave. But two years later we learned the truth. There was a lot more to the story.', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[The Houston Astros cheated their way to a world series championship in 2017.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn late 2019, a whistleblower came forward, a pitcher who had played with the Astros for three seasons.', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[They have a guy on the record. A guy that was on the team. Mike Fiers, a pitcher, who laid out exactly what they do.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMike Fiers alleged that the Astros had been sign-stealing during their championship season. While the team had these fancy modern algorithms and an entire cave full of data nerds, their signs stealing plan was a lot like those used 50 years earlier. It was a mix of high-tech tools and low budget mischief.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe Astros had a camera aimed directly at the other team’s catcher, which broadcast to a TV in the tunnel behind the dugout. To communicate the pitch to the batters, Astros players would watch the TV. And when they saw a fastball coming, they did nothing. Any other pitch, they would hit a bat against a plastic garbage can. It sounded like this [sound of bat hitting a garbage can]. Here it is again. We tried to come up with an analogy for what it sounds like, but really it sounds exactly like a bat hitting a plastic garbage can. [sound of bat hitting a garbage can]. Major League Baseball opened a full investigation into the accusations. The Astros manager and general manager were suspended and then fired by the team. The team was fined $5 million, which is not a lot of money for a franchise worth nearly 2 billion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe investigation confirmed the Astros had been sign-stealing during the 2017 and 2018 seasons and during the playoffs, and maybe even the World Series.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe Astros are still the 2017 World Series champions, even though many baseball fans insist they deserve a massive asterisk. Some of the game’s biggest stars think that, too, like Aaron Judge of the Yankees.', 'Aaron Judge:', '\\n“Yeah, I just don’t think it holds any value. You know, you cheated and you didn’t earn it. That’s how I feel.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nAnd Mike Trout, the best player in baseball.', 'Mike Trout:', '\\n“It’s sad for baseball. you know, it’s tough. You know, they cheated. And you know, just I don’t agree with the punishment.”', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThe Astros scandals created many what-ifs that can never be answered. No one denies that the Astros were a really talented team, but would they still be World Series champions if they hadn’t cheated? Data analysts have tried to answer that question. And several prominent ones have found the advantage the Astros got from sign-stealing might’ve been surprisingly small. Of course, a small advantage can mean a lot in such a competitive sport.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese questions aren’t so abstract for someone like Mike Bolsinger. An analysis by a computer programmer revealed that when the Astros faced Bolsinger, they banged on their trashcan lid 54 times, the most times the Astros had used that system in all of 2017.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nAnd a lot of those bangs happen during Bolsinger’s short appearance in the game. Someone hit the trashcan immediately before 12 of his 29 pitches.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nIt just makes you mad. I think, you know what would’ve happened if I’d hadn’t have pitched that game. So then you start to question things about your career now and then. It truly was the most embarrassing moment in my career. 100%. I’ve never been more embarrassed of myself, ever.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nMike Bolsinger filed a legal complaint against the Astros on February 10th, 2020. In the complaint, he blamed them for effectively cheating him out of his career. He’s seeking damages and he wants the team to give up $31 million in bonuses that the players received for winning the World Series, which would be donated to charity.', 'Mike Bolsinger:', '\\nIt makes you mad every once in a while. It truly does, because you put so much work into getting to this spot in your career. And then you kind of find out, hey, this was taken away by people that cheated.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nThis isn’t exactly the first time somebody’s broken the rules of baseball. In the early 2000s, there was the steroid scandal. And since the beginning of baseball, players have doctored the ball or put cork in their wooden bats or slid into their opponent’s legs cleats up. They say baseball is a game of inches, a game in which every small advantage matters. And the Astros embraced every edge they could find as they transformed themselves from a laughingstock into a champion. But when it came to baseball’s age-old tradition of sign stealing, the Astros didn’t just push to the edge, but over it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis episode is adapted from “The Edge”, a six-part series hosted by Ben Reiter. You can download it now wherever you get your podcasts. We’ll have more with Ben, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’m back again with Ben Reiter. And as we’re talking this week, the Amy Coney Barrett hearings are happening in Washington. And during the hearings, Senator Ben Sasse started attacking the Astros, for seemingly no reason. So here’s a clip of that.', 'Ben Sasse:', '\\n“I’d like to talk about the Houston Astros, who are miserable cheaters. Sorry Cornyn and Cruz, but both of the Texas senators sit on this committee. But I think all baseball fans know that the Houston Astros cheat, they steal signs, they bang on cans. They’ve done a whole bunch of miserable things historically and they deserve to be punished probably more than they have been.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then, Ted Cruz defended the Astros, and it feels really weird that this is happening during a Supreme Court hearing. What did you make of all this?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nWhat I made of it, Roman, was that the Astros are now the go-to symbol for villainy for everybody. Right? No matter who you are, no matter what you think, you can point at what the Astros did as representative of villainy, as representative of corruption and there’s little risk in doing it. That’s what I took away from that.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Right. So you mentioned on the show that you’ve covered the Astros, and you wrote about them for Sports Illustrated. And you actually wrote a whole book called Astroball. So when you heard about the sign stealing, what did you think? Were you personally disappointed?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nI was really, really surprised because I had spent so much time with this team over the years, I’d written a whole book about them, as you said, and I had no idea about this. But I was also interested in part of my own reaction, which is that while I was surprised by the particulars, I wasn’t entirely shocked to hear that the Astros had been the one to do this, just because they did everything to an extreme, right? Their pursuit of the edge went so far in every way, most of them perfectly legal, that it kind of made sense that, oh, maybe they just took sign stealing, which as we know from the episode is an age-old tradition in baseball, to a new extreme as well. So that was kind of what sent me on my quest here and sent me into the making of my podcast, to answer that and many other questions about a subject I thought I knew really well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we talk about this long history of sign stealing and various ways in which people did it, and it was really egregious and violated norms, and ways in which it was not so egregious and people kind of thought it was okay. Where do the Astros fit into all this?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nWell, as we heard, everybody cheats in baseball, but it’s kind of like everybody else is going 75 in a 65 mile an hour zone, right? And the Astros went straight to 100. And what they did also fit into their kind of technocratic MO, which the baseball world had really started to turn against. This was an age-old, fun, admired tradition and they took all the fun and artistry out of it, right? It almost used to be like a caper film, the telescopes here, the binoculars here. What the Astros did was just kind of mechanized dominance, and it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo one of the big questions that we ask in this episode and is part of the series, is would the Astros be World Series champions without sign stealing? They made the playoffs this year, they did not make it to the World Series.', 'Sports Announcer:', '\\n[File to the right of second of the pitch, swing, and a pop fly shallow right, charging Margot, he is under it. And the Tampa Bay Rays have just won the American League Pennant. For the second time in franchise history, the Rays are on their way to the World Series.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDoes that kind of settle the question? What do you think?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nNo, I don’t think it settles the question. And that’s one of the tragedies of this entire story, is that we’ll never be able to go back and replay that history fair. And why did a team that was already so talented feel like they had to do this? They were so good anyway, right? We met Mike Bolsinger in our episode just now, a guy who throws 90 miles an hour, whose ERA is near five in his career, which isn’t so great. A team like the Astros could have knocked him around. They could have ended his career anyway, fairly, but it wasn’t fair. So one of the things I really want to know is why did a team with all this talent take this extra step it didn’t even necessarily need?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt kind of reminds me of the Watergate break-in. Nixon was so far ahead, but they still had to break into the DNC to make himself feel better about… To make him more comfortable with winning. He had to cheat to win, even though he was winning. It’s sort of a weird tragedy to have people like that.', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nI made this podcast with Prologue Projects, including the guys who made the Watergate season of Slow Burn. They’re not big sportspeople, but they certainly know about scandals like this. And I think it was that element that really connected with them and continues to.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’re only covering one small aspect of the entire series that you’re doing, called The Edge. So what can people expect when they subscribe to this? When they’re going to rush out and subscribe right now to The Edge, what are they going to hear?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nWell, there’s a lot more to this. You’ll learn a lot more about why they did it, exactly who was doing it, the specific dynamics within the organization that led to corruption like this taking root. Now I’m going to give you a little teaser. You’ll also learn something else, that they were running a second sign-stealing system parallel to the first, at the same time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat?', 'Ben Reiter:', '\\nBut you’re going to have to subscribe to The Edge to find out about that. I’m not giving that away right now.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, I love it. I love it. That’s fantastic. Well, that’s so cool. It’s called The Edge.

Stay with us.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFirst, it’s producer Joe Rosenberg.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so Joe, what do you have for me?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWhat I have for you, Roman, is a story that I have been sitting on for quite some time. It’s one of those ‘Planet Money’ pitches that I never sent to ‘Planet Money’.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’ve got a drawer full.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, and it actually starts, or rather my familiarity with it starts about five years ago, when I was reading the news and I came across this weird little AP wire service item.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWeird AP wire service items are our specialty.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, exactly and it was about this announcement in Britain by George Osborne, the then chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, that Britain was finally going to finish paying off its bonds from World War I.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike 100 years ago World War I, not World War II? World War I.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYes, bonds from the war to end all wars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s right.', 'News Report:', '\\n“Still counting the cost of the great war, Britain is only now redeeming most of the remaining bonds raised to pay for World War I 100 years after it started.”', 'News Report:', '\\n“Britain has remembered its debt to the fallen. Another country is set to repay its financial debt.”', 'News Report:', '\\n“The government will pay off more than $300 million worth of those bonds in February.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI was like, how is it possible that it’s only now paid off its bonds from World War I? I mean, I know it must have been expensive and obviously, Britain issued a lot of bonds to pay for it, but I figured Britain, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, must have paid off those bonds a long time ago.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Just so I make sure I’m up to speed. A bond generally is like when the government needs funds for something and they don’t have enough cash on hand. They’d go to the populace essentially and they say, “Buy this bond for X amount of money and then over a course of 10, 20, 30 years, we will pay you back that amount of money plus a little bit of interest.” This is guaranteed by the government, so it’s a really, really safe investment.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, and after like max 30 years, usually the bond matures, that’s the term, at which point the government has redeemed the bonds.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey pay back everything and the interest in 30 years’ time?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nCorrect, and they are no longer in your debt.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, but these World War I bonds weren’t redeemed until they were 95 years old, so that seemed way too long for a bond.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, no, it’s crazy, but then it got weirder because it turned out, World War I was just like the most well-known thing the British government wasn’t done paying off. There were actually older bonds from their books that they announced they were also redeeming as part of this package, including bonds from wait for it, the Crimean War, a relief effort for the Irish potato famine…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\n… the Slavery Abolition Act, the Napoleonic Wars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGoodness, gracious.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nEven that wasn’t the oldest of the debts because after making the announcement about World War I, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, must have felt that he was like on a roll because he then sent out a tweet, which just might be the most anachronistic tweet that you’ll ever see. Check this out.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, it says, “We’ll redeem 218 million pounds of debts incurred because of the South Sea Bubble, another financial crisis we’re cleaning up after.” What was the South Sea Bubble? What is he talking about?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWhat he’s referring to there are bonds from a government bailout of investors who were ruined by the infamous South Sea China Bubble in 1720.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, of course, how could I forget? The South Sea China Bubble in 1720.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, of course. I mean, obviously, these bondholders who were still getting paid back by the UK government 300 years later, they had not forgotten. They were still expecting their money.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is incredible. 300 years of bonds. How is that possible?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt turns out what is going on and the reason there were these old, old debts is that all of these were examples of a very rare type of bond called a perpetual bond.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow does a perpetual bond work?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOkay, so a perpetual bond is quite simply a bond that never matures. It promises that instead of paying you back your principal plus interest in full after say 30 years, the government will just keep the principal. Instead, they’ll pay you, your children and your children’s children’s, children’s children a small amount of interest every year for basically all eternity. For at least until they decided to redeem the bond, which means they finally decide to pay you back the principal, which is what the British finally did with 1200 or so perpetual bondholders in 2014.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow, so when did they make a perpetual bond? I mean, maybe a better question is, why did they do it in the first place? It seems like a really bad idea to borrow money this way. Where did this idea come from?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe answer is actually that in some ways, in the beginning, most bonds were perpetual bonds.', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“Before there were even bonds, all borrowing, there was just a process through which you would rent money, you would rent capital. ”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThis is Geert Rouwenhurst, he’s a professor of finance at Yale. Geert says that, if you go back to the middle ages, you have to imagine an economy where actually kind of like today, renting is really popular. You might pay a small amount of money every month to rent a field or oxen or a house.', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“Just as you would rent a house for an unspecified amount of time, you would rent money for unspecified amounts of time. In private arrangements between two parties, it was always easy to say, I’m going to rent it for some unspecified time and you call me or I call you, and that’ll be the end of the loan.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo just the way that you rent an apartment and you give the apartment back when you’re done renting it, you could do the same thing with money.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so if you needed 50 gold coins and I were your creditor, I’d basically say to you, “Look, I’ll give you 50 gold coins now and you can keep them as long as you want. Just as long as you promise to pay me at least two gold coins a month indefinitely until you give me the original 50 coins back”?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nExactly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, that makes sense. If that was the standard, that their early type of loaning was perpetual loans, why aren’t there more perpetual loans being paid out still to this day?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight. That’s a good question and it turns out that there were a few problems with perpetual loans. The biggest might simply be that, when it came to bonds issued by governments and companies, these types of bonds carried a lot of risk with them, because governments and companies collapse all the time. At which point not only do payments stop, but you’re also not going to be getting your principal back, like ever. Geert says this happened all the time. There were bonds issued by France before the French Revolution and by Russia before the Russian Revolution. Spain defaulted on its debt like three times, and so most perpetual bonds are now just lost to history.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs the South Sea China Bubble from 1720, is that the oldest perpetual bond or are there even older ones out there?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nActually, there are older ones and Geert or rather Yale owns one of them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, cool.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, so Geert is the Deputy Director of an academic research group at Yale called the Center For International Finance. One of the things they do is engage in something called scripophily, which sounds like an ancient skin wasting disease. All it means is that they collect and curate financial instruments from various places and times in history.', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“One of the most interesting contracts in our collection is a very old Dutch bond issued by a Dutch water authority in 1648, which pays interests as of today.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n1648. So this is a bond that’s been actively paid back since 1648?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYes, and in fact, all of the oldest known perpetual bonds – I think there’s fewer than like half a dozen of them – are from this single Dutch water board. The reason is because this water board is basically this regional entity, which for hundreds of years has been in charge of maintaining all of the dams and levees and dikes in a given corner of the Netherlands. That’s a good business to be in, it’s really stable.', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“The Dutch water authorities, they never go to war and they have the power of taxation, so they have been good borrowers.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\n“Right, and also there’s a strong incentive for those institutions just to survive because people need them in order to not drown basically.”', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“That’s right, yes, which will become even more pertinent going forward.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt’s super cool and I actually also have a photo of it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, cool.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWould you like to see it?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOkay, so if you pick up this book to your right, go to the flagged page. This is a book Geert and a colleague edited called ‘The Origin Of Value’, which is about various financial instruments throughout the ages. There’s a chapter all about this bond and so you can see the front and the back of it here.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. Well, it’s like just a bunch of script, like it doesn’t look designed the way I think of a bond looking with all the filigree and cool stuff about a bond. It’s really basic.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. Although what you will see at the center of the front page of the bond, there is this small print. It’s laying out the terms in Dutch that even Geert says he has struggled reading this old Dutch, but basically, it says and I’m going to botch all of these names: ‘Johan van Hogen-houck, that’s the representative of the water board, acknowledges to have received from Mr. Niclaes de Meijer 1,000 Carolus guilders of 20 Stuivers a piece’.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDoes it say what those 100 Carolus guilders were for?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYes, actually it does. It was for a new cribbage in the town of Honswijk and a cribbage apparently was a kind of pier that was placed in the bend of a river. The pylons of the pier would help prevent the bend in the river from shifting and meandering.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so it just kind of keeps the river in place?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, and don’t get me started on meandering, that’s my whole other obsession, as you know.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat are Stuivers?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI have absolutely no idea, but the bond also acknowledges that they owe an amount of 5% a year to Mr. de Meijer, his heirs or other rightful persons, which means this bond is transferable either as a gift or by sale to anyone else.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. The other thing I noticed about this is that there’s all these notes and annotations all around the corners. I mean it looks like it’s been annotated essentially. Is this the sale and transfer? Is that what that’s all about?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThose notations are a record of every single time someone has collected on the bond and how much was paid out and when it was paid out.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh okay, cool.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt really is a living document, which has been written on continuously throughout its 400-year history.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like a blockchain.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, no, that’s exactly what it’s like. Even to the point where actually they know how much to pay out because they see all the previous notations, so they know how much back interest they owe you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, and you can actually see, they actually ran out of room. If you go to the next page of the book, starting in the 1940s they added this thing, which is called an allange or sometimes a talon, which is basically like an extra bit of paper with the seal of the water board that continues this tradition of notating every payout.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI can see all the notations. It goes across, it looks like it goes all the way to 2003 on here. It’s really diligent.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOh no, yeah. One of the things that I love is that you can see the handwriting of the receiving clerk at the water board getting more and more modern and kind of less and less elegant as the world got more modern.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDo we know these people who collected this bond? Is that written down here on who bared this bond?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nNo, we actually don’t, but Geert says that’s kind of the point. This is a bearer bond. I mean, if you’re the person holding it, you’re the person they have to pay. It doesn’t matter who you are.', 'Geert Rouwenhurst:', '\\n“That’s a unique aspect of a bearer bond. There doesn’t need to be a record of who owns it. The bond itself is the ID.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou actually have to take this piece of paper and go to Holland to collect the money for it?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYes, precisely that is the catch. Anyone can present this bond and collect their money, sort of no questions asked. Almost like it is money, but you have to physically present it to the registrar at the water board office. That’s what all these notations are really notating, that someone showed up.', 'Tim Young:', '\\n“To keep it alive, the bond itself needed to travel in person, with a bearer at least once in a generation.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThis is Tim Young, he’s the curator of modern books and manuscripts at the Yale Beinecke Library, which is where the bond currently lives. He is the most recent bearer of the bond. He actually traveled all the way to Holland from New Haven to collect on it. He was the first person to do that since Geert acquired it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe way I picture this is that there’s this old Dutch building from the 17th century just sitting there and an old man has been waiting for centuries…', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSure, let’s run with this.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n… for a person to bear the bond in a clerk suit. I don’t even know what…', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nA Scrivener.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExactly. Would be sitting there. It’s lit by a candle. He has a Quill pen and he makes a notation and he hands him some money from an old till or something. Maybe it’s in gold medallions or script that is also 400 years old.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYou nailed it. No, actually what you said, it’s all kind of like half true.', 'Tim Young:', '\\n“When I showed up with this water board bond, it was in a little town called Hooten. My brother and I walked about half a mile down the street and found this very lovely building and knocked on the door. I said, ‘hi, I have my water board bond,’ and they go, ‘oh yes, we’re expecting you.’ Then we went to a conference table and they literally gave me a gigantic paper check like you see on TV.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhy’d they do that?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWell, so full disclosure, they actually had a Dutch television crew waiting for him.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo they were doing this little bit.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOh yeah. I mean, this was obviously good PR for the water board and for Yale. They weren’t going to let this moment go to waste.', 'Tim Young:', '\\n“Then they gave me a check, a real check, a small check to bring back to New Haven. Then they said, oh, let’s actually go see the pier.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat is he talking about, the pier?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe public work that this bond funded is still there. It’s still standing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my goodness, okay.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, and it’s still regulating river flow, which just might be my favorite aspect of this whole story.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow!', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAn actual real-life human thing that was achieved by this bond, and this kind of weird aspect of time travel where you were partially responsible for this thing that nevertheless predates you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Tim Young:', '\\n“When I went in 2015, I got to stand on the pier, they called it, that had this connection between me, between Yale and people who are working for a company that is the descendants of something that was established 400-500 years ago.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m trying to wrap my head around just the value of this bond and the value of what they payout. Yale bought it for how much money?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nObviously, it’s an incredibly rare item for any scripopholist, scripophile, I don’t know, but Geert told me that they got it at auction for roughly $24,000.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, and so how much did Tim get on his both big and tiny check when he went there?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, not as much.', 'Tim Young:', '\\n“They did 12 disbursements for every year worth of interest that was being paid out, and that was 11 Euro, 35.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWith 12 years back interest, that came out to a whopping 136 euros and change.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is the thing about a perpetual bond is that inflation really eats the value of a bond like this.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nA Carolus guilder just isn’t what it used to be.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGuess not. Can’t buy a beer with that anymore.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nNo, sir.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThanks so much. That’s awesome, Joe.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRoman, you’re welcome.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m in the studio with Sean Real, our composer and you always bring me a delightful music-related mini-story every year.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nOh, thanks Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat do you have for us this year?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nOkay, so do you know what concert pitch is?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI have no idea what concert pitch is.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nOkay, so it’s what an orchestra will tune to and we basically have like a standard pitch right now of 440 hertz. Which is like, if you think of a sine wave, 440 hertz means that the sine wave is like hills and valleys. It’ll go up and down 440 times in a second.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, and so all the instruments are tuned to this pitch so that they all sound good together essentially? The A note that one instrument plays is the same A note that another instrument plays?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nExactly, and 440 hertz is Concert A.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs this the standard for every orchestra all around the world or does it vary depending on where you are?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nIf we’re just talking about Western music, which is mostly what I’ve researched for this, like there are a lot of different tuning traditions. In Western music up to like a lot of pop music and stuff, today it’s like mostly 440 hertz.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow did they center that as being the value that everyone tunes to?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nIt’s actually a very messy history of how we got here. If you go back a few hundred years, if you go throughout different countries in Europe, you would be hearing wildly different things as far as like what the pitch was for different orchestras.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs long as all the instruments in the room are the same tuning, does it really matter that between orchestras they have the same tuning or did anyone really care?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThere was a time where people didn’t really care and music didn’t really travel that much anyway. It’s really fascinating to think about this time where, if you were traveling from country to country-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTo gain a lot of opera hour.', 'Sean Real:', '\\n… had good pitch you could hear, you could tell that the orchestras were, some were tuned really low and some were tuned really high. Some as low as like 374 hertz and some as high as 567 hertz, which just for reference let me play you what that is. First I’m going to play you 440, which is what we do today. (440-hertz note plays). Now here’s 374. (374-hertz note plays)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, so that’s really different. Yeah, I don’t have very good pitch and that’s very different.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYeah, and those are both considered A.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow, okay.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThen the highest one, 567. (567-hertz note plays)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow!', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThose are all supposed to be the exact same note. That’s the reference point for an entire piece of music. Where these numbers come from is from this survey conducted by the French government in the 1800s of different pipe organs, which were centerpieces of a lot of orchestras which are just centered around the church pipe organ. In order to tune a pipe organ, it’s more like construction than it is actually just regular tuning. It’s always made more sense to just tune to the pipe organ.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI see. I see. Whatever the A that the pipe organ says it is, that is what the A is for that room because retuning a pipe organ it’s not like twisting a little knob on a violin?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nNo, it’s like getting in and sawing stuff and sanding.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAll these sort of un-standard tunings get perpetuated in different rooms and concert halls because of the pipe organ that is there?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYeah, so there was a time when the pipe organ was the most central part of the orchestra, but then stuff started to develop in Europe. As concert music became more of a thing, more of like an event to be attended, concert halls started being built bigger and bigger. You would have just large, large halls, you could put lots of people in it, but they couldn’t really account for how sound travels. If you were sitting in the back of a concert hall, you would mostly only hear the bass, because bass notes just travel further than higher frequency notes. To compensate for this, a lot of orchestra leaders would tune higher. They would get everybody to just move everything up and they were just stories that I was reading of people being frustrated because their strings were always breaking.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were tuned too tight.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nSingers were having to go to the doctor from straining their voices and people were in uproar about this.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s already the chaos of every pipe organ being different and then they introduced concert halls. Then there’s this arms race for how to be higher so you can be heard better in concert halls. Then it gets more chaotic and so every different concert hall is now pitched wildly different, it drifts even more?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nMostly consistently getting higher and especially with violin strings and sort of those kinds of stringed instruments being able to be tuned higher. String makers were making strings stronger in order to keep up with the pitch rising gradually. It came down to singers being like, “You have to stop.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“You have to stop.”', 'Sean Real:', '\\n“We have to stop this.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“Can’t sing any higher than this.”', 'Sean Real:', '\\nIt got to a point where the French government actually had to like decree that concert orchestras would tune at 435 hertz.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, and so you said 440 was the standard now?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n435 is set, so obviously it’s shifted. When did 435 become the standard?', 'Sean Real:', '\\n435 became the standard in France in 1859, but then a while, while later in 1919 it was adopted by a bunch of other nations. That’s because of the first Treaty of Versailles.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Treaty of Versailles that was the surrender of Germany during World War I.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYeah, the treaty that ended World War I.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat actually has a clause in it that talks about the tuning of orchestras?', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYeah, section two, article 282.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey took this seriously. Wow, okay.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThere’s all this stuff about tariffs and like standardization things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat makes some sense. You’re trying to create a unified Europe, so you’d want taxes to be fair and import and export. You wouldn’t necessarily expect French tuning to be the thing that is the thing that is adopted in the Treaty of Versailles, but there it is.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nAnd yet they did. America, at that point, was tuning to 440.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe actually violated the Treaty of Versailles.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nWell, we didn’t sign it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe didn’t sign it, that’s right.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nActually, one country that did violate the Treaty of Versailles in this particular instance at least, was the United Kingdom. The way that tuning is written in this convention that’s in the treaty, is that you have to tune to 435 hertz based on a tuning fork at a room temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. I think it was the Royal Philharmonic in the UK were like, ‘Well, our concert halls are a bit warmer. We are at about 20 degrees Celsius, so it makes sense for us to tune a little higher, because the temperature would actually bring us down to 435.” Actually, they were ending up at like 439 with a bunch of smaller instances and details that I didn’t find super interesting. There was another convention meeting of the minds about concert pitch and it was raised to 440-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n440 after that point, but that’s amazing that it was considered so important culturally for the harmonious existence of Europe that everything be tuned to the same frequency.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nYeah, it makes a lot of sense when you think about like instruments are built to be optimal for a pitch of 440 hertz, like a 440 A. I feel a little romantic about the idea of just going to the town over, like the music’s going to sound a little different.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. That’s kind of nice. Like you haven’t heard Handel’s Messiah until you’ve heard it in Prague or something like that.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nExactly. Yeah. Oh, that was another one of my favorite things was that Mozart actually wrote everything at 421. I was wondering if in the movie about Mozart, they had like actually…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, done it at the right frequency or the contemporaneous frequency.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThey appeared to have not so I’ve never really heard a Mozart song.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s true. Maybe none of us have. That’s so cool. It would actually be kind of a fun exercise to have an orchestra digitally remaster the classics in their original tuning. It’d be so interesting just to hear if there’s a real difference. I don’t know if I could, my pitch isn’t so terrific. Maybe you would enjoy that exercise quite a bit.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nI wonder if there are people that are already doing that. If anybody is doing that, please reach out to us and just tell us about your work, what you’re doing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s awesome. Okay, cool. All right, well thanks, Sean.', 'Sean Real:', '\\nThank you, Roman.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m in the studio with senior producer, Katie Mingle.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nHey, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHey, it’s been a while.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI know. It really has.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat’s your story?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nWell, I think we should start out by meeting someone named Irene Wurtzel.', 'Irene Wurtzel:', '\\n“Hello?”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Hello. Is this Mrs. Irene Wurtzel?”', 'Irene Wurtzel:', '\\n“It is indeed.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIrene and her husband Alan live in an area in Washington, D.C. called Kalorama.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI don’t know what that is.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIt’s a very fancy neighborhood. It’s the neighborhood that Jeff Bezos lives in.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI see.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner live there, or at least they did until very recently. I’m not sure if they still do. A bunch of like ex-presidents, former presidents have lived there. Woodrow Wilson, FDR, the Obamas live there currently. Yeah, when you think of this neighborhood, think of motorcades and secret service retinues. There are definitely some standalone homes with yards, but then there’s also a lot of row houses like townhouses right next to each other, but like huge. Multi-floored.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, fancy ones.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nWe’re not talking about like tenements, but I guess no matter how fancy a neighborhood is, there’s always going to be that neighbor who’s just problematic. Yeah, so Irene has this house right next to her. Here I’ll actually let her describe it.', 'Irene Wurtzel:', '\\n“Well, it’s just a very early 1900s house with very good lines, nice windows and it has an elegant look from the outside. No one has lived in it since we’ve been here.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow long are we talking about?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThat’s since 1993.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWoah. Okay.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is substantial.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYes, like almost three decades I think. I think that’s…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, getting close.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah. This is a 10,000 square foot, five-floor mansion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s huge.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIt’s a huge space to just sit empty for that long. It’s also connected to Irene and Alan’s house. It’s one of these row houses. I think what happens to that house can actually affect their place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf a vacant property has rats or termites or a bug problem, it actually causes more problems to the neighbors than otherwise because they’re connected.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nRight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIrene says, over the years there’s been stuff like decaying pieces of concrete, bricks falling off, I guess a wooden window frame from that house dropped onto their patio somehow. Then there have been things like rats and other little visitors.', 'Irene Wurtzel:', '\\n“They kept the windows open and, among other things, birds flew in and out of the house. On the side of the house, the window was always open. I think birds are building nests in there.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, she said there was one brief period where this house next door was kind of a noisy rooming house of some sort but mostly it’s been empty since 1993.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s not so much that she has like a problematic neighbor, it’s that she just has no neighbor at all and it’s a problem?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nRight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, so why has it been so empty for so long?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThat is the question, Roman. That’s it. That’s what we’re here for. The answer is that this house falls into this special category of property in D.C., which is diplomatic property. It’s like a very D.C. problem.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. One of my favorite things to do in D.C. is to go to the embassy row and spot all the flags. That’s like my favorite thing to do, so what country owns this?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nOf course, that’s your favorite thing to do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s fun, but what country owns this property?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThis house is actually owned by the government of Argentina. It’s not the embassy per se. It’s a building that the government-owned. I’m not quite sure why. Maybe initially they would have people stay in this house when they came to town to do embassy business. I think it’s possible that people who worked at the embassy may have lived there at some point. D.C. has about 530 of these diplomatic properties, like embassies and kind of additional houses. They’re not all falling apart like this, but there’s definitely several buildings that are in pretty rough shape. They’re common enough that they’re like YouTube videos that you can watch with people exploring them. Here, let me put one of these on.', 'YouTube Video:', '\\n“All right guys, so we’re at an abandoned embassy. We already made it inside.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nFirst of all, this guy should have a second career as like ASMR video guy.', 'YouTube Video:', '\\n“A lot of this and stuff were abandoned just due to financial issues and then relations between the countries, other stuff like that. This one’s been abandoned for 18 years.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThere’s one part where they’re in the bathroom and they’re kind of like, “This is a big day, this is what people in other countries used to wash their butts.” These guys don’t know a ton about-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOther cultures.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n… other cultures necessarily, they’re just doing the YouTube stuff, trying to get some views. It’s sort of not ideal to have all these empty mansions that only lawbreaking YouTubers are using. It’s actually really complicated and difficult to get anyone to do anything about these buildings. They aren’t actually considered to be foreign soil. There’s sort of a misconception out there that they are foreign soil, but they do have a bunch of special privileges. For example, the police couldn’t get a warrant to search for an embassy. They’re exempt from, I think most if not all taxes, and they don’t have to build by code. They’re encouraged to, but they don’t have to.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI see, I see. There could be an illegal kitchen on the back of…', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nTotally, yeah. Like a city council member for the Kalorama area was quoted saying, “Basically if I have a vacant house that’s becoming a problem, I can call in the cops, clean it up through a fence around it. If necessary, seize it for unpaid taxes.” He says, “I have a lot of tools in my toolbox, but I don’t have those tools available to me if it’s a diplomatic property.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nOne thing that makes these properties interesting and maybe also a little harder to address, is how different each one is. If you think about your neighbors kind of having issues or your neighbors potentially having baggage, behind each of these properties is basically the story of entire countries in political upheaval. Let’s take Yugoslavia.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, that’s not even a country.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nRight. Exactly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey have a property?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, God.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThey don’t anymore actually, but they did and for quite a while they had this house. In 2006, all of their diplomatic properties were divided among the six succeeding countries. This house that they owned in D.C. was turned over to Bosnia. The deed was never transferred and then in 2008 someone at the Bosnian embassy was quoted saying that, they didn’t even know who had the key. I guess they eventually found it because they did finally sell the house in 2015 for $650,000. It had been vacant for like three decades, so it was in terrible shape. There was a tree growing through the garage, there was mold everywhere. I think the owners basically gutted it and started over. In response to a lot of different neighbors complaining about a lot of different properties, the state department issued a response saying like, “Basically our hands are tied because of this Vienna convention. The only recourse we really have is to remove diplomatic status from these properties, in which case they become subject to the same property taxes as everyone else and sometimes that motivates them to sell.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhy don’t they do that? What’s the problem with that?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI think they do sometimes do that, but I think they’re pretty hesitant to do it, because they want to maintain good relations with these countries. These properties I think are probably kind of low on their list of concerns overall. Actually, in the case of the Argentinian place right next to Irene and Alan, they actually did remove diplomatic status from that property and it didn’t seem to make a big difference.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhy not?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI mean just politics again, like I believe Argentina’s ambassador told the Wurtzels that the country would actually gladly be free of the property and the tax burden of it. But because of a loan that the country had defaulted on in 2001, they couldn’t just freely sell their assets. I don’t know if that’s still the case for Argentina. I did not reach out to the country of Argentina for a comment, but they still haven’t sold it.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIrene told me that about six months ago that they saw for sale sign go up in the yard and they got really excited. It came down a few days later and she thinks maybe they just changed their minds.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s too bad.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so cool. I’d never thought about that at all before when I was looking at flags in embassy row. Another thing to consider.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, and thanks to a writer at the Washington Post named Jenna Portnoy, who wrote the article where I first read about this. Also, thanks to Abby Madden who works with us on the show and helped me with a lot of this research.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCool. All right. Thanks, everybody.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe have one more story about secret nuclear families and how they were hidden from foreign spies and even the post office after this.', '[BREAK]', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So I’m here with Delaney Hall and so what is your mini-story?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo I’ll start by telling you about these home movies that I recently came across on YouTube that have kind of been haunting me. They’re from the 1940s so they don’t have any sound. I’ll just have to describe them to you. Imagine early color films, so the colors are kind of muted and washed out. And the films show footage of these young people like in their twenties and thirties. They’re riding horses through the mountains of New Mexico. They’re skiing, they’re playing tennis. There’s one movie where it looks like they’re having a party at a lake, so they’re all in bathing suits and there’s this one woman carrying a 12-pack of Coors on her shoulder. Another is doing that funny walk in flippers down to the edge of the water.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat doesn’t sound especially haunting. That sounds really pleasant.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nI know, I know. They’re totally normal home movies, but they’re haunting, once you understand the context, which is, these were movies filmed by a physicist named Hugh Bradner back in the 1940s at a place that was then known by a secret code name, ‘Project Y’ or ‘Site Y’. Today it’s Los Alamos. And so all of these seemingly carefree young people, they weren’t just having a great time in beautiful Northern New Mexico. They were helping to build the first atomic bomb.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. That adds a lot of context. Heavy stuff is going on in the background of that.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, and it’s sort of the contrast of them having fun, hanging out, and then knowing what they were doing during their working lives and they were helping to build this weapon of enormous power and destruction. It’s going to completely transform the world – the geopolitics of the world – but they’re also just young people living their lives.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nThere were a lot of young people here. The average age was 29. The most common age was 27. So you had a lot of young single people here. There were a lot of young couples.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo this is Alan Carr and he is the senior historian at Los Alamos National Lab and he says the fact that there were all these young people working together on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos actually presented some surprising security challenges. Because for one thing, some of them, it turns out were hooking up and getting married.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. Exactly.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd having babies out there on this top-secret military campus, which was not even supposed to be a place on the map.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nAll the sudden you went from a locale in New Mexico where no children were ever born, hardly, to all the sudden there’s eight births a month. That looks awfully suspicious if you’re doing the paperwork down in Santa Fe. Why are all these kids being born in Los Alamos? I don’t even know what Los Alamos is.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo now we think of Los Alamos as this place where the bomb was made, but at the time was Los Alamos even like a place that would have couples and babies?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight. No. Back then it wouldn’t have been and that, yeah, that’s an important point. And so to understand why this would have been suspicious, let’s backtrack and I’ll explain how the government even chose Los Alamos as the site for bomb development and what it was like before it became Project Y. So what happened is in 1942 the military decides they need a central laboratory in an isolated place where they can design, build and test nuclear weapons.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nWhere do you put a place that does those types of things? This was arguably history’s biggest super-secret project.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd so they decide there’s some very important criteria for this place. It needs to be remote, for safety reasons. They want to keep the scientists who are working on the project away from other people. They do not want them accidentally blabbing about what they’re doing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, that makes sense too.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd they also want it to be near a rail hub so that they can ship all the stuff they need there – cyclotrons and whatnot. And then finally they want it to be at least 200 miles from any international boundaries.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nMaybe they watch these old movies where a saboteur gets off a submarine and runs in and sabotages the factory. It blows up. Well, we want the saboteurs to have to run a long, long way. Right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s a good point.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. So at this point, and again this is 1942, Robert Oppenheimer has been selected as the head of Project Y and he had spent a lot of his time in his youth in Northern New Mexico, which is remote and meets most of the other criteria. So they start looking around the area and pretty soon they settled on what’s now known as Los Alamos, which is about 45 minutes northwest of Santa Fe.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So what was Los Alamos really like back then? How would people think of Los Alamos back then?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nBack then it wasn’t even a town. There was this rustic boys’ school there called the Los Alamos Ranch School and that was about it. So the government just bought the school. They went about setting up this state of the art lab on the top of this very isolated remote mesa.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. That sounds hard. That sounds logistically very difficult to do. And then, especially in 1942.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, it was kind of a logistical nightmare. The whole location was served by this one little that snaked up a huge cliff and they were shipping in massive pieces of equipment, pipes for one thing because Alan Carr told me there wasn’t a reliable water supply, and there also wasn’t any electricity.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nAnd so the original engineers who built the town acquired a large generator in Texas. They had it shipped to Santa Fe by train, put it on a truck and drove it up the hill. And as they were, it fell off the truck, it broke, it cracked, and they welded it back together and managed to get it up the hill. And so in those opening months of 1943, the real heroes were the construction workers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo like listening to all the things that they had to do, it doesn’t sound like you could keep Los Alamos a secret for very long. If you’re shipping gigantic generators and there’s these trucks on the highway, I mean, how do you keep that all secret?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight, yeah, it’s kind of mind-boggling. So for secrecy, the main thing they did is that the people who worked on the project weren’t necessarily told what they were going to be doing until they agreed to join the project. So they’d be told something vague like you’ll be doing important work for the war effort. It might help to bring the war to an end. But it was really only after you arrived in Los Alamos that you would learn the details. There was also a fence around the whole town so that people couldn’t just wander in. And then there was the mail. So all the mail was censored obviously so that no one would accidentally write a friend and say what they were doing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. That totally makes sense. I mean I’m surprised they even had mail. I mean, how could you have mail trucks coming in and out of Los Alamos? I mean that seems like a huge security risk in and of itself.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight. It would have been. And so according to Alan, there were not mail trucks coming in and out of Los Alamos. All the mail was actually delivered to Santa Fe and it was delivered to just two main PO boxes that served the entire Project Y. So there was PO Box 1663 which was for the civilians. Because all the scientists working on the project were civilians. And then there was PO Box 1539 for the military. So that meant that all the mail coming to the area just went to one place that was far from the actual town and then it would likely have been trucked up by the military.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if there are two PO boxes for the entire community, is that like people wrote to a thousand people per PO box basically?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. So the number of civilians working at Los Alamos was in the thousands.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nIt would have in the low thousands, I would guess. People receiving mail at PO Box 1663, probably somewhere between 4,000-5,000. So a lot of mail.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nThe fascinating thing is that this whole PO box thing actually connects back to the Los Alamos baby boom that we were talking about at the beginning.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, how was that?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo as Alan was saying, there were all these young people working in Los Alamos back in the 1940s and the scientists and engineers who worked on the bomb, they were civilians, which meant the military could not boss them around as easily or control their behavior in the same way they could with people who were enlisted.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nIt’s easier to control people in uniform than civilians. If you’ve got a bunch of people in uniforms here working, one thing that they’re not doing is getting married and having children.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nBut the civilian scientists, that’s exactly what they were doing. A lot of them were young. They’re basically partying when they weren’t working, as I’ve seen in those home movies they shot. And they were also having babies, which was a total headache for the military.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nOppenheimer’s boss was the general named general Leslie Groves, and he didn’t like all these kids being born, because, well, first of all, you have to try and keep it secret. You have to put a maternity ward in the hospital, you have to have a school district. All these things he didn’t want to have to worry about. So he ordered Oppenheimer to tell the staff to ‘stop having kids’.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m sure that went over well.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nIt actually, as I’m sure you can imagine, did not go over well.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nEspecially considering that the director’s wife kitty was pregnant at the time. So I don’t think that that order was carried out.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo how did they manage to keep all these new Los Alamos babies under wraps?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo the main way was that they did not list the place of birth on the birth certificates. They couldn’t put Los Alamos because Los Alamos didn’t really exist in the official record. It was totally top secret. They couldn’t put Project Y cause that would also be weird. And so even though these babies were born at the hospital in Los Alamos, their birth certificates just said ‘PO Box 1663’.', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nIf it says PO Box 1663 that keeps that a lot more secret.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAlthough it also seems like you’d be like, what are these babies born at a PO box? What does that mean?', 'Alan Carr:', '\\nThat’s right. But at least the PO box doesn’t give you a location and that’s what they were trying to keep secret.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo any idea how many kids were actually born and have the PO box listed as their place of birth?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAlan guessed maybe a hundred or 150 kids. He has actually seen some of the birth certificates before.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat a weird side effect of history. Well, cool. Well, thank you so much, Delaney. Appreciate it.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, thank you.']], ['Perfume: Articles of Interest #9', '05.19.20', 'Episode AOI #9', ['Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“So, what do you wear?”', 'Rachel Syme:', '\\n“Oh my God.

I mean, I would. We talk about how foods are umami or spicy or how music can be soothing or energizing or cacophonous, but with scent, we don’t really analyze it with a lot of nuance. The question is usually black or white. Do you like the scent or not? This smells good. This smells bad. We just don’t have a lot of tools to analyze smells linguistically or scientifically. In fact, there is no way to assess the volume of a scent. There are no instruments that can measure odor levels.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nWe have instruments that can measure the chemicals that are in an odor plume, but that doesn’t translate into, at least not at the present time, into what the odor experience is for any individual.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nPamela Dalton is a senior scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. But when I talked to her, she was not in Philly. She was talking to me from a conference room in Chicago.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nI’m here for a deposition. I do expert witness work from time to time. And this is an odor case involving people’s complaints around a landfill.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn legal cases involving smells, they have to hire professional noses to make very subjective calls. And it’s not like Pamela is a superhuman. Generally, people are pretty good at smelling, much better than we think we are.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nWe can smell things when there’s one or two parts of a fragrance material in a billion parts of air, which is really, really tiny. So we’re more sensitive than we believe. You know, dogs may be sensitive to a range of compounds, but humans have much more sensitivity to a much more diverse set of chemicals in the environment.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut we don’t use scent the way dogs and other animals do. And in part, it’s because we’re bipedal. Our noses quite simply evolved to be farther away from the earth.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nWe’re now at four to five to six feet above the ground. So we’re smelling different things, right? We’re not smelling things as we were when we were loping around on all fours.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nYet still, on occasion, we’ll lift our noses to the air and take a sniff. It’s just that more often than not, we pay attention to smells that present a threat — spoiled foods, rot, death, mold, if there’s a fire or a gas leak. Farts.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nAnd so we learned that we want to stay away from those kinds of odors.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWe’ve come to associate scent with something primal and unpleasant. If you ask, “Hey, do I smell?” The collective assumption is that that’s a bad thing. We want to avoid smells and smelling. And this mentality goes back to a number of philosophers in the west from Plato to Aristotle to Kant, who derided our sense of smell as base and secondary, or really like quinary. Historically it has been the least respected of our senses. And so a lot of folks just try to ignore it.', 'Pamela Dalton:', '\\nBut I think as a species, we have discounted that we really can smell a lot of chemicals at vanishingly trivial concentrations.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo we have the capacity to smell things in the parts per billions, but we lack the capacity to talk about them. So much of learning to smell comes from learning how to describe smells.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nSo I was at a party, a woman came in who was hugging everybody and she smelled really good. A number of people told her that she smelled good. And I said, “Okay, I can tell you that she’s wearing this particular brand. And it’s from this many years ago. And the reason that she’s most cozy and snug is because it’s got a lot of ionones in it. And she smells sort of like orris, which is the aged root of the Florentine iris flower. And it’s got a sort of a powdery feeling so she smells like a hug.” And everyone’s looking at me and I was like, “I’m not smelling any more than you are. I just have the words to tell you what the brand is, when it came out, and what’s in it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nMiranda Gordon is the vice president of marketing at Mane. Mane is a fragrance company because the lion’s share of the hundreds and hundreds of designer perfumes that come out each year are made by the same dozen or so companies. Mane has made perfumes for Banana Republic and Armani and a ton of scents for really widespread popular brands you definitely know, like, (beep) and (beep).', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nWe’re not allowed to talk about those so don’t mention those.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nFor some brands, that’s a dirty secret that they contract out their scents to other companies. But I don’t think there should be any shame in it, because sure, most of us have the potential to get really good at smelling, but actually designing a perfume is something entirely different. It’s like composing a piece of music or choreographing a dance. It is an art and the professionals make it look easy.', '[MUSIC]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLet’s start simply. Some perfume ingredients can be very straightforward. Like if you’re trying to use a citrus scent, that’s pretty easy to get. That scent is extracted from the peel of the fruit with cold pressing.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nThe same way we make olive oil, we can make grapefruit oil or lemon oil or lime oil or mandarin oil.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut there are a lot of scents that you can’t just get. You can’t just press the oil of a mango or a strawberry or a pear or an apple. Like if you pressed an apple peel, you wouldn’t get apple oil, you would get apple juice, which is not very fragrant, and you wouldn’t want to dab that on yourself. So there are many, many scents that perfumers have to build molecule by molecule, in a laboratory.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\nThere are chemicals that have an apple odor to them.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nGino Percantino is one of the perfumers at Mane. If he wants to make an apple scent, he will gather a bunch of smells together, what some perfumers call notes.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\nCombining and mixing those notes to get an authentic apple smell.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd a group of notes makes an accord.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\nAn accord is a group of ingredients that is usually less than 10 ingredients, to try to emulate a specific thing.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd there’s no one set apple accord. Every perfumer has their own way to make it. Think of it like Gino is painting a picture of an apple. It could be realistic. It could be impressionistic. It could be cartoonish. The apple could be slightly fermented. It could be a yellow apple or a green apple. It could be in a tree. It could be in a pie. Listen to how Gino renders a fig, which is another one of those scents you have to build note by note.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\nFig is always fun for me because I often work from some of my best coconut, just coconut. So I’m not talking about like pina colada with pineapple and all that. Just the creamy kind of coconut. If you dial it back and put more pulp into it, a little more juiciness into it, a little more green with some extra woods, cause you want that stemy element of it. And then you’ve turned a coconut into a fig.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd that’s the part that’s technically impressive, but making a perfume is not just about rendering a good believable fig. It’s then using that fig in a way that’s interesting and new. So Gino could situate the fig in a scent that’s smoky and leathery or something powdery and floral, or something lush and green, or include an ingredient that I would have never considered.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\n“My favorite ingredient is Sichuan pepper.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Really?”', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\n“Yeah. Sichuan pepper. It’s kind of citrusy. It has a citrusy element. It has an aromatic element. It has that little spicy element.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere’s a virtuosity in professional perfume. That’s the difference between, say an essential oil from a health food store, and a perfume. It’s the difference between the pleasure of a single ripe peach and the pleasure of an exquisitely executed risotto. Professional perfume is artistry and intuition and a lot of hard science, because some combinations just don’t work on a molecular level.', 'Suzanne McCormick:', '\\nIf you don’t know what you’re doing and you take the smell of black currant and the smell of rhubarb, when you put it together in a test tube, things are going to interact at the molecular level and it’s going to smell like the cat pissed on your weed.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn Mane’s laboratory, in Midtown Manhattan, perfumers and technicians were busily mixing drops from a selection of hundreds and hundreds of notes. The smell of the laboratory was incredible. It wasn’t like a perfume counter in a department store. That smells like 50 top 40 radio stations blasting at once. Mane’s laboratory smells like an orchestra of raw possibilities, composed of both natural and synthetic ingredients. And without derailing this whole story, let me just say, there are some controversies in there. Perfume ingredients are considered trade secrets, so they aren’t listed on the bottle. And this opacity has caused some worry because there are ingredients, natural and synthetic alike that can trigger allergic reactions. And some animal studies have found fragrance chemicals that are probable carcinogens or have been linked to liver, kidney and lung damage. The perfume industry says that all of the ingredients they use are at such low concentration, that they aren’t dangerous to human health, but there have been calls to set more limits on the materials perfumers can use. And sure enough, every now and then an ingredient gets pulled off the market.', 'Gino Percantino:', '\\nI look at it as if they’re doing some kind of testing with ingredients and they’re being a little restrictive. I think there’s some value to that if it’s going to help humanity and in some way it ties my hands a little bit on trying to be creative.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nGino is operating within a set of constantly shifting constraints. Instruments are being removed from Mane’s orchestra all the time. By the different regulatory laws of every country, yes, but also by an ingredient’s availability. When a certain scent becomes trendy, it becomes harder to procure. Take Indian sandalwood. It’s a delicious natural scent, super popular.', 'Suzanne McCormick:', '\\nThere’s a drop of Indian sandalwood and pretty much everything on the market. And the challenge with Indian sandalwood is that the trees have to be at least 30 years old before you can harvest them. You can’t just go plant more trees and have more oil tomorrow. You’ve got to wait 30 years. So Indian sandalwood would have to be replaced with Australian sandalwood which doesn’t smell the same or with synthetic sandalwood which doesn’t smell the same.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo making a new perfume isn’t just unbridled creativity. It’s limited by a lot of factors. And at the end of the day, the scent has to sell. Mane’s brilliant perfumers probably aren’t going to make something that smells like fig and Sichuan peppers. They manufacture pop music. They’re trying to make something interesting within the parameters of mainstream taste, something you’d buy in a Sephora or something you’d buy in your grocery store. Because Mane and the dozen or so major fragrance companies don’t just make perfume. They work on every product that has a smell.', 'Suzanne McCormick:', '\\nHome care, cleaning, laundry, personal care.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSuzanne McCormick is the head of fragrance for Method products. They make soap and detergent and body wash. And they work with two of the major fragrance houses because I kid you not, it is just the same small handful of companies that are crafting all the scents all around us. And this overlap means that trends in high-end perfume affect your dish soap.', 'Suzanne McCormick:', '\\nThere is a trickle-down.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt’s just like how high-end fashion designers will create a look that eventually ends up at H&M. If a fragrance company develops an accord that sells really well, that scent might eventually end up in your face cream or your laundry detergent.', 'Suzanne McCormick:', '\\nRose had been considered the older fragrance note and then all the fine fragrance, many fine fragrance brands were bringing it to life in a modern way. And then as you trickle down to our body wash, we have peony rosewater. And awhile back there was sea salt and everything, so we did lime and sea salt that was one of our fragrances that we did that’s continued to do very well.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd so, these scent companies are everywhere making you, your kitchen, and your bathrooms smell like citrus and lavender and rose. But this idea of our bodies smelling somewhat interchangeably with our fabric softener and our dishes is relatively recent. We used to have a wildly different concept of what it meant to smell good.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nI guess I could start with the perfumes that shocked me the most. And there were the perfumes of the 20s, 30s, and 40s.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBarbara Herman is the creative director of Eris Parfums, and the author of the book, “Scent and Subversion.”', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nI like to describe what I did in this book was sniff my way through the 20th century.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhat we think people should smell like is completely cultural. And it’s changed over time. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, women were marketed perfumes that were more funky.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nWomen smelled like tobacco and leather. And, you know, as Jacques Guerlain said about his perfumes, perfume should smell like the underside of my mistress.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere was this idea that perfume was supposed to smell funky. Perfumes had ingredients like ambergris, which is oxidized whale vomit, and musk, which is deer sex gland secretion. Now, these kinds of smells are made synthetically, but in the early 20th century, people wore the real stuff, which sounds off-putting, but actually the smells are fascinating. Barbara happened to have some real ambergris in her refrigerator.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nI mean, it’s a very, very hard scent to describe. Some people say there’s tobacco notes. There’s obviously a very, animalic kind of fecal quality to it, but also slightly metallic and coumarin or hay-like, slightly sweet. It’s more of a feeling than it is a smell for me. It’s just like being enveloped in warmth.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI loved this smell.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I’m like looking at a landscape through a pinhole. Oh, can I see more of it?”', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\n“Yeah. That’s a good way to describe it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I wish I could stick my head in a box full of it.”', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\n“It’s very evocative.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nFor all those weird and gross descriptors, ambergris smells incredible. Most scents, especially naturally occurring ones, are way more nuanced and strange than we’d like to believe. There’s a sweetness in sweat, a fruitiness in blood. I know I sound like a psychopath, but there’s a really fuzzy line between delicious and off-putting, if you pay attention to your nose and forget the fact that this may be whale barf.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nBecause it’s sensual and cozy and a lot of subliminal, unconscious effects. I can’t put them all into words, but if you’ve experienced them and if you’re open to them, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd it’s interesting that people in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s were more willing to wear these strong animalic smells. It’s particularly interesting that they were marketed to women. On the one hand, it’s kind of empowering and bold and sensuous, but it also meant these women weren’t exactly dousing themselves to go to board meetings. These were scents for the bedroom and our idea of what femininity should smell like evolved in the 1950s when a lot of bright and powdery scents came out. Very like Doris Day, peppy.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nFlorals, huge ass white florals, screaming.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd then like everything else in culture, scent was subverted by the time you get to the 70s when there was this natural wave of oakmoss and patchouli. Then the 1980s were about big bold fragrances, the kind that, as Rachel Syme puts it, could clear an elevator. And then there was a very important pendulum swing in the 1990s, a sea change that mainstream sensibilities have still not recovered from.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nThe 90s was generally the clean decade.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is when perfumes like CK One came out for men and for women. There was this wave of clean smells that were light and fresh and inoffensive. They made you smell like you just showered.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nYeah. I mean, there’s some great clean perfumes. Like don’t get me wrong, I love to rag on them, but I just think that what perfume meant in the past and what it means now is very different.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nClean scents took off in a major way, exceedingly popular, a lot of money in them. And when perfume just became kind of generally pleasant and non-threatening, more and more companies felt comfortable yoking their prize brand name to it.', 'Barbara Herman:', '\\nIndustrial perfume creation world, which happened like after the 90s or starting in the 90s when perfumes just got mass-produced, the celebrity scent thing.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd so broadly speaking, we are still stuck there in the fresh and clean era, particularly the United States.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nOh, we’re Puritans. To smell is to be sensual, or to be erotic or dirty. That’s why fresh and clean is such a big deal in this country.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nMiranda Gordon at Mane again.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nIn France, you’re sexy if you’re a little funky. Here, you’ve got to be freshly showered and smell like nothing.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd in fact, if you do want to smell like nothing at all, that also involves fragrance because even when you’re buying a product labeled “fragrance-free,” that is often not true.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nA product that’s labeled fragrance free in all likelihood remained a customer of ours. And we had to fragrance it in order to cover up the malodors of the functional things in your product. There’s probably something in there, it’s what we call a masking odor or a masking aroma, that’s canceling out whatever fishy smell or funky smell or oily smell the ingredients in your face cream might have.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBecause most things on this earth have a smell. It’s just that an industry has developed around avoiding the weird ones. We want to smell fresh and clean and nothing else. And so, yeah, the mainstream perfume market’s been stuck in the clean boom for some decades now, but there’s been a quiet revolution in the last 15-ish years. On the fringes of perfume, an indie scene has blossomed.', 'Antonia Kohl:', '\\n“Okay, we’re going to smell tomato leather.

This is what it smells like when you’re waiting for the ferry to take you to Seattle. There’s so many more unusual scents in this store. We’ve got stuff that smells like campfires…”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOoh, thousands of independent perfumers have started popping up. Many of them taking artistic risks that a designer brand wouldn’t dare attempt. There are hardcore boutiques like Tigerlily scattered around the world. And they almost act like oddball record shops for the underground music nerds who want to sniff the strange stuff.', 'Antonia Kohl:', '\\n“It literally smells like a bat’s cave. It’s like a strong petrichor where you feel the water on the dirt and the stone in the cave. And then it also represents a day in the life of a fruit bat. So you also get the fallen fruit like rotting banana, and you get a leather that represents the bat’s wing.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn this relatively new movement, there are a lot of perfumers who make scent on the side as a passion project. That’s the case for the perfumer who made the bat scent. She has a day job.', 'Antonia Kohl:', '\\n“She’s also a bat behavioral scientist and an orchid farmer.

A waft of bergamot always reminds me of an ex. Eucalyptus brings me back to childhood trips to visit my grandma in San Francisco. We all have this superpower to use scent as a gateway to the past, but in learning to smell and learning to talk about smell, we can experience a vivid present. To stop and smell the roses, sure. But also stop and smell the garbage. Really. And the couch, and the hallway and the shampoo and the skin of a mandarin, the sweat and the rain and the pleather and the brick.

The bottle was plain. I had never heard of the brand. At first sniff, it was cozy cedar and leather. It was riding on the back of a motorcycle through the woods. Another sniff, and it smelled like gasoline and it was actually sickening. It nearly gave me a headache. I abandoned the scent for months, but recently came back and smelled again. And this time something malted came out of it, almost gourmand. I can’t pin it down. It changes with my mood. It changes with my skin.

We love.', '[BREAK]', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nGender and fragrance is as artificial a social construct as gender in society.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAmen, Miranda Gordon, VP of Marketing at Mane.', 'Miranda Gordon:', '\\nNobody ever said that flowers were only for girls. Or actually, we did say… the industry said. But I don’t know that the globe agrees that flowers are for girls and woods are for boys.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere is no way a given gender is supposed to smell because we all just kind of smell like our skin and sweat. The distinction between cologne and perfume is just about the concentration of oil. It’s not that cologne is any more masculine than perfume. It’s just the way it’s marketed. Men and women both used to wear a lot of perfume, usually to mask the fact that they didn’t bathe, until one man decided that perfume was for women.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nBut in the course of that, he also would bathe every day, which was taken at the time, the late 18th century, as a rather ridiculous vanity and indeed something that might be even dangerous for your health, to wash that often.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThat’s author Ian Kelly. And he says there was this one historic gentleman who decreed that men should smell as plain as possible. In fact, he also thought men should dress as plain as possible. That to be manly was to look boring.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nHe, yes, happened to be the right person at the right time to be the center of some shift in fashion.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nYour next Articles of Interest are suits.']], ['Their Dark Materials', '01.21.20', 'Episode 386', ['Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbout a year ago, we released an episode in which I interviewed the author, Kassia St. Clair, about her book, ‘The Secret Lives of Color’. It was a conversation about the history and origins of different colors throughout human existence and during our talk, Kassia and I covered everything from a type of purple that’s squeezed from sea snails to a shade of green that could literally kill you. But there was one pigment in particular from that episode that one of our producers here at 99PI hasn’t been able to stop thinking about.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBecause it’s bonkers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nProducer Vivian Le.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s called Vantablack and it’s a pigment that reaches the level of darkness that’s so intense, it’s kind of upsetting. It’s so black, it’s like looking at a hole cut out of the universe. It’s so black, it’s like looking at a portal into another dimension of nothingness. It’s so black that if you stare at it long enough, you’ll see your own death.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nI could keep going.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThese metaphors are crumby, but it’s like this philosophical abyss. Your eyes just fall into it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Adam Rogers.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nI’m a journalist, I’m a writer at Wired and I write books sometimes too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRogers has written about Vantablack for Wired because when anyone sees it, not just Vivian, they think it’s bonkers. It makes you rethink what black means.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nVantablack is striking when you look at it. Even when you look at a picture of it because it looks not like something is colored black. It looks like an absence.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nVantablack swallows nearly all visible light and gives back no reflection. So every contour or crease of whatever it’s applied to disappears. It has this odd effect of making something look two-dimensional while at the same time as if you could fall right through it.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nIt has the same feeling – looking at it as a color – that looking over the edge of a building or something does. You actually do feel kind of a physiological response to it like, that does not look right. That looks unreal. It looks unreal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nVantablack was created by the tech industry for the tech industry, but this strange dark material would actually go on to turn the art world on its head.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThere are black pigments out there and then there are super-black pigments that are so dark, they need to be created in a laboratory. These super-blacks reach such extreme levels of darkness because they’re made up of something called carbon nanotubes or CNTs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCarbon nanotubes are pretty much exactly what they sound like. Teeny tiny microscopic tubes comprised of carbon atoms, just a few nanometers wide. For reference, a single human hair is about 80 to 100,000 nanometers wide.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nCNT materials are made up of forests of these microscopic carbon tubes.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nI’d say it’s like a field of grass. And the grass is a carbon nanotube and about 1/6,000th the thickness of your hair, and there’s about a billion of them per square centimeter.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Ben Jensen, the found and CTO of Surrey Nanosystems, which specializes in carbon nanotube technology. He’s the kind of person who, even as a kid, you’d expect to become the founder and CTO of a carbon nanotube technology company.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nWhen I went through school, I spent my time trying to make gunpowder type rockets and then I kind of went to develop liquid-propellant systems that were rather dangerous and used to go bang and kind of not very safe. Back then, people didn’t really care that much about safety and they would go, “Yeah, yeah, this sounds like a really cool idea.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nKids, this is not a really cool idea.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nJensen began working in the nanomaterials field in 2004. Back then, CNTs had a lot of promise in the space industry because super-black coatings could be really useful inside of satellites, telescopes, and optical imaging technology.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut carbon nanotube technology wasn’t quite where it needed to be yet. CNTs weren’t like paint. They had to be grown onto a surface in a special type of reactor at an absurdly high temperature. High enough to destroy most of the things you might want to grow them on.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nJensen and his team worked on it for years and finally managed to develop a new reactor that allowed them to grow CNTs at a much lower temperature. And in doing so, they had one unexpected but delightful side effect. They made it blacker.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nOne day we got some data back and I said, “Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ve grown this material and it’s got almost unmeasurable low reflectance.” And I was, “Okay. What does that mean?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt meant that Surrey Nanosystems had created the darkest substance on earth. A material that absorbed 99.965% of light.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHe couldn’t tell from the numbers, but Jensen knew the CNT was really special after one of his researchers showed him a sample.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nAnd he said, “Look.” And I’m like, “Okay, what am I looking at? It just looks black.” And he said, “No, no, look.” And I’m putting my face right up beside it and the guy is looking and laughing at me and I’m going, “Hey, it just looks black.” And then he did something that just told me we had nailed it. He took an object off the surface that was three-dimensional, so I could then see it. Before, no matter how close I put my eyes to it, I couldn’t tell there was anything there. It was just flat.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nVantablack was so dark that it almost felt like it defied the laws of physics.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nWe weren’t looking to create the world’s blackest material. That wasn’t our thing.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nJensen and his team decided to give this new flashy CNT of flashy name, Vantablack.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich stands for Vertically Aligned Nano Tube Array Black.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAs black as Vantablack was, Surrey Nanosystems still saw it as a niche material. So when they launched their product at the Farnborough Airshow in 2014, they saw themselves as small fry. Farnborough is a big deal in the aerospace industry. Surrey Nanosystems was presenting their nano material at the same event as the Boeing Dreamliner, military jets and a paragliding car, so Jensen wasn’t expecting to make much of a splash.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut that’s not what actually happened.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nIt was just surreal. We had camera crews from literally all the major networks there filming. Looking at these materials because no one had ever seen anything demonstrated like this before.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nPeople were freaking out over Vantablack.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nWe just didn’t expect it and my scientist was like, “Well, it’s just black. Why are we getting all these people going crazy about it?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPeople were amazed by the depth of darkness achieved by Vantablack and wanted to know more. Soon enough, Surrey Nanosystems was receiving all sorts of requests from people who wanted a piece of it.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nPeople wanting to coat their cars in it. People wanting to coat dice in it, coat their bodies in it. We had a very well known YouTuber that spent quite a while asking us saying, can he please eat it live on YouTube?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAside from that Tidepod-eating bleep-ing idiot, what really caught Jensen’s attention was the amount of interest that came from another field in desperate need of a super-black pigment. The art world.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIn those first couple of weeks alone, Surrey Nanosystems received over 400 inquiries from artists wanting to use it in their work.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nThe number of people in the art world that wanted to use it, that was absolutely quite a crazy time actually because we’re a company that’s set up to do engineering and space, not a company that’s set up to create products for artists to use.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nWorking with artists was just not something Surrey Nanosystems was equipped to do because Vantablack was incredibly hard to work with. Sure, they could grow it at a much lower temperature than before, but that was still about 430 degrees centigrade. CNTs were also really delicate and could scrape off easily.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut most importantly, any collaboration with artists would take up time and tech resources because anything coated with Vantablack would have to be grown in Surrey Nanosystems reactors.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nIt just wasn’t a practical proposition for the company. That said, Anish is an incredibly charismatic chap with an amazing vision and his life’s work has just been phenomenal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnish as in Anish Kapoor, who, if you haven’t heard of him before, is very famous.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nSo Anish Kapoor, for decades has been one of the premier contemporary artists working today.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Adam Rogers again.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nHe’s the kind of person who will do like a whole gallery takeover at the Tate Modern. He’s a really big deal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe should note here that Anish Kapoor did not respond to an interview request for this story but he’s probably best known for creating Chicago’s iconic ‘Cloud Gate’ sculpture, also known as ‘The Bean’ and he has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to visual arts.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd when Vantablack debuted, he wanted it. So he reached out to Surrey Nanosystems and invited Jensen to check out his studio.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nI walked into his studio and I was literally speechless of what I saw.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nGiven his body of work, Kapoor seemed uniquely suited for this material.', 'Anish Kapoor:', '\\n“There is, in a way, a constant continuous process that gives up the same questions.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Anish Kapoor in a video he released about one of his pieces titled ‘Dissension’.', 'Anish Kapoor:', '\\n“So those questions are, for me, the void object or the non-object. Many questions about color, questions about space and time, because I really do believe that for there to be new objects, there has to be new space.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nKapoor has a fascination with black’s capacity to make something both exist and not exist at the same time.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nHis work, a lot of it, deals with voids, deals with color blocks and voids. Tries to understand the relationship between color and space.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOne art installation titled, ‘Descent into Limbo’ is just a giant black hole in the ground that looks like it plummets into oblivion.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThere was a circle on the floor that was just blacker than black could possibly be. A couple of years ago, somebody actually fell into it.', 'News Report:', '\\n“Now to the Italian man who found out the hard way that a very realistic looking painting of a black hole was in fact, an actual black hole. Fortunately, the man who tested the art out is going to be okay. He’s now at home recovering from a back injury.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSurrey Nanosystems couldn’t work with 400 different artists, but they could work with one. Kapoor was the perfect choice.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThey signed a contract with Kapoor stating he would be the first and only artist who would get to work with Vantablack. Surrey Nanosystems already had all sorts of exclusive licenses with contractors in the defense and space industries, so they figured an artist’s license wouldn’t be that different.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nIt’s not implausible that Surrey Nanosystems thought that the deal was the same as any other deal that they would make with anybody else who wanted to use one of the things that they made, that nobody else in the world could make. That’s not crazy, but it did have consequences.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nConsequences that rocked the art world.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nWe had expected when we announced it was exclusive that it would limit the amount of requests we were getting because the administration staff within the company were simply bombarded and overloaded with requests from the art world.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nDid that actually happen after this relationship was announced?', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nSadly not.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOnce again, people were freaking out over Vantablack, but for very different reasons this time. At first, people thought that somehow Anish Kapoor had the exclusive license to the color black, which was obviously not true.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nAnd that created a firestorm of hatred. And I think back to that time, we were getting hate mail, death threats, all kinds of crazy stuff. You know what the Internet’s like.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nVantablack is a nanotechnology that can only be achieved using Surrey Nanosystems’ proprietary reactor and trained technicians. It is not a color. It’s a technology. They didn’t patent a shade of black that absorbs 99.965% of light. They patented a unique process and material that absorbed 99.965% of light. Still, a lot of people thought the technology was beside the point.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nSo we’re talking about ownership of no light. So how can someone own no light?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Stuart Semple. An artist based in Bournemouth, in the UK.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nI understood quite quickly how elaborate it was to use the stuff. But that didn’t change how I felt about this exclusive arrangement they attached.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nInitially Stuart was really excited when he first heard about Vantablack, even though he wasn’t sure what he would make with it.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nI wasn’t really thinking about how I would use it. I was initially just in awe of the stuff itself. I hadn’t really got ideas because, by the time I’d had a chance to hatch an idea for it, it turned out that Anish Kapoor had the rights to it and everything else.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nStewart actually doesn’t blame Surrey Nanosystems for choosing to work with Anish Kapoor. They came from the world of tech and had a completely different mindset.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe object of his frustration was Anish Kapoor. Stuart thinks morally, as an artist, Kapoor should have known better than to try to keep Vantablack exclusively for himself.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHistorically and presently, so much of art has been dependent on new technology. From oil paints to photography to video, art evolves with whatever’s technologically possible. So the fact that this new material was purposefully being withheld from the rest of the artistic community ruffled a lot of feathers, including Stuart Semple’s.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nIt just smacked of complete art world elitism and the power to dominate things if you’ve got money and stature.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAlthough Ben Jensen from Surrey Nanosystems is quick to point out that artists being protective of technology isn’t actually a new thing in the art world. Artists have been creating their own oil paints since the Renaissance and they were under no obligation to share their material with their competitors.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nToday, people feel if something exists, they have an automatic right to it. So because we curated this material, everybody has an automatic right to it. The reality is the world has never been like that. You go back to when Turner was creating his blacks and you go up to him and say, “Hey, you created an amazing black, I want it.” You would have been laughed out of the art scene.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Semple sees it a different way. Regardless of what Renaissance artists did, he believes that sharing knowledge and technology can only move the arts community forward.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nWhich is why he actually felt a little hypocritical. Stuart had been mixing his own paints and pigments for years to use in his own artwork and he realized he wasn’t practicing what he preached: sharing.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nI was no better than him because I’d been making these awesome colors and just using them for myself. I’ve been hoarding them for my own work. I wasn’t sharing them.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nStuart had a bunch of pigments that he created himself: the Greenest Green, the Pinkest Pink, the Glitteriest Glitter. You get the idea. And it occurred to him that he could kill two birds with one stone. He could share his colors with his artistic peers and poke a little fun at Anish Kapoor’s exclusive license to Vantablack.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nSo I thought what I’ll do is I’ll share my Pinkest Pink that I made with the whole world and put it on the internet as a joke, as a piece of performance art, if you like. To use the internet as a space for debate and dialogue.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWith one caveat, everyone in the world could use this new color except Anish Kapoor.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nI would ban Anish Kapoor from using my pink.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nStuart put one of his colors, the Pinkest Pink up for sale on his website with a very specific purchasing agreement.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nSo to buy the Pinkest Pink, you have to agree to legal terms and conditions on the website when you add it to your cart and they are that you’re not Anish Kapoor, you’re in no way associated or affiliated to Anish Kapoor and the best of your knowledge, information and belief, the paint won’t make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe move was part joke, part performance art. He figured a few of his friends would buy some and they’d have a good laugh about it, but he ended up selling tens of thousands of jars of the Pinkest Pink, each one a tiny middle finger to Kapoor.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd things escalated quickly from there.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nKapoor comes back, posts a picture of him giving the middle finger to the camera with his finger coated in this pink, in Semple’s pink.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAdam Rogers, again. Anish Kapoor had somehow managed to get around Stuart’s ironclad user agreement and posted a picture to his Instagram account of his actual middle finger covered in the Pinkest Pink.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nSo this is like teenagers fighting. Like they’re having a fight on social media.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nI didn’t think it was actually Anish Kapoor, so I just thought it was someone having a joke. But then when I realized it was him, I was like, ‘oh my God, that’s really, really bad’.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was bad, but it was also kind of good for Stuart. He got one of the most prominent artists in the industry to publicly flip him the bird, and now he had the internet on his side.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThe rest of the artistic community in thousands and thousands comments was like ‘F you right back, buddy’.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nCommenters piled onto Anish Kapoor’s Instagram post telling him to #sharetheblack. Stuart suddenly found himself with an army of open source art defenders behind him and he was ready to mount a full scale attack.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nAnd Stuart captured that vibe. He thought, well, okay, if that’s the way it’s going to be, I’m going to make a better black.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo he decided to beat Kapoor at his own game and create a super-black paint that could rival Vantablack. It took years of development and multiple iterations and an entire community of crowdsourced artist feedback to develop the formula for something that he calls ‘Black 3’.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nGrowing in the cosmetics industry we used what we call matifiers. So we borrowed some of that technology and then we reformulated the binder to make it really open and really wide, so we could cram loads of this black pigment in there, which makes this really super-black, almost like velvet thing.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBlack 3 doesn’t trap as much light as Vantablack, but it’s still pretty dark.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYou can imagine what it’s like in the Justice League to stand next to Superman. Well, I don’t have that many superpowers, but I have some superpowers.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYou’re still very strong.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYeah, he’s still very strong. Exactly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBlack 3 is like Aquaman. It’s fine.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nStuart made sure it was an acrylic paint because any painter would be able to easily work with it. It’s also affordable so that artists can actually buy it. And lastly-', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nYou can’t buy Black 3 if you’re Anish Kapoor. If you’re associated with Anish Kapoor or to the best of your knowledge, information and belief, it’s going to make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnish Kapoor wouldn’t be painting with Black 3 anytime soon. But as it turns out, neither would Stuart Semple.', 'Stuart Semple:', '\\nDo you know, it’s too black for my work. I can’t use it. It’s too black. The minute you put it on a painting, it just dominates everything.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAfter all the feuding, research and development, and sheer painstaking work that went into creating one of the world’s blackest blacks, Stuart doesn’t use it. And oddly enough, Anish Kapoor, the person who set off this whole controversy in the first place, hasn’t used his blackest black very much either. A few years back, he released a limited edition $98,000 Vantablack watch, but that’s about it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNeither Semple nor Kapoor had much use in having the darkest pigment in the world. But there was one artist who actually did.', 'Diemut Strebe:', '\\n“Hello?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Hi, is this Diemut?”', 'Diemut Strebe:', '\\n“That’s me. Hello. So nice to talk to you.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nDiemut Strebe works at the intersection of art and science. And recently she came out of nowhere with a black pigment that rendered the entire feud between Kapoor and Simple, pretty much meaningless and the best part is, she didn’t even mean to.', 'Diemut Strebe:', '\\nMy artwork in this setting really triggered a scientific discovery, which is unusual in these times. Usually artistic work would not trigger a scientific paper, but in this case it was. It really came out of the arts and I thought this was really cool.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 2019, Strebe released a work called, ‘The Redemption of Vanity’ in which she coated a $2 million diamond in a new nanotube material developed with MIT’s Necstlab. It’s a critique of material value because the diamond’s value, is visually speaking, reduced to nothing.', 'Diemut Strebe:', '\\nDiamond and carbon nanotubes are two forms of carbon atoms in a different order. That means that you have the most brightest material and the most blackest material basically generated from the same element.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis new carbon nanotube material created for Strebe actually unseated Vantablack as the new blackest material in the world. It traps an astronomical 99.995% of light as compared to Vantablack’s 99.965%.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nWhich is ironic because the only reason she developed a blacker black than Anish Kapoor’s is because of Anish Kapoor. Had it not been for the exclusive license with Kapoor, MIT and Strebe’s new record-breaking material might not exist. By choosing not to work with other artists, Surrey Nanosystems unintentionally inspired a rival super-black material that beat their record.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Strebe says she wasn’t trying to one up Surrey Nanosystems or make a statement to Anish Kapoor. If anything, she was just trying to move past the bickering and create art.', 'Diemut Strebe:', '\\nI like art to be free and speak through its conceptual powers and aesthetics. I’m not interested in raising the moral fingertip to Anish Kapoor or anybody else.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnish Kapoor still has the exclusive rights to use Vantablack in his artwork and it’s unclear whether he’s planning on releasing any future pieces using the material. Actually, his most recent exhibition couldn’t be any further away from black. It’s a series of mirrored sculptures that are almost impossibly reflective.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese days Stuart Semple has a new giant to slay. He’s taken on T-Mobile. The company has been sending cease and desists to small businesses using a similar shade to their trademark pink. So in protest, he’s released a new pigment that he calls, ‘Pink TM’. It’s an exact color match to T-Mobile’s and it’s available to anyone unless they are in any way affiliated with T-Mobile.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBen Jensen is still at Surrey Nanosystems developing newer iterations of Vantablack that are not exclusive to any artist, but he seemed a little hesitant to work with artists again.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nI just recognize that as a company, our focus is not the business of art.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHe seems pretty content to return to his humble childhood ambitions of blasting super cool things into space.', 'Ben Jensen:', '\\nPersonally, I love the space business. I just absolutely love it. Like I said, I started as a young kid trying to build space rockets and today we have materials that we create orbiting the earth. And I cannot tell you how that makes me feel. You know, this little kid that was looking at the moon on dark nights saying, ‘God I want to send something up to space,’ to today, we actually send stuff into space.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAs for the black that came out of MIT, Diemut Strebe knows that this isn’t going to be the end all be all for the world’s darkest pigment. Another material will eventually come along and end their reign as the blackest black. But what’s important to Strebe and Necstlab isn’t that their material’s the darkest, but that it’s available to the rest of the art world. So for now, the blackest black is open to any artist to use, including Anish Kapoor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat’s the opposite of Vantablack? Vantawhite. Actually, that’s not the answer, but we do have a story about a color pigment that is so desirable, it was at the center of a case of economic espionage. Adam Rogers comes back to tell me that story after the break.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the big takeaways of the Vantablack story is that there is color all around us, but we don’t really put a lot of thought into the process of creating it. Journalist Adam Rogers, who we heard from in the Vantablack story and who is writing a whole book about colors, came into the studio to talk to me about the technology behind another pigment that was so sought after that it was at the center of an FBI investigation. You may not have heard of it before, but chances are you haven’t gone a day, maybe haven’t even gone an hour, without coming into contact with it.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nIt is titanium dioxide. The coolest thing about titanium dioxide is that everyone interacts with it all the time. Because it is, primarily, it’s the thing that makes almost every human-made thing white, white. It’ll confer an almost platonic principle of whiteness to things. It’ll convey opacity and brightness as well, so you find it in other colors. Other pigments. House paints will be like 40% titanium dioxide, no matter what color they are, even if they’re red. But titanium dioxide’s in a bunch of different colors as well as being like in a tube of titanium white oil paint that you would buy if you get the real stuff.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThere was a story that, it may be apocryphal, during the Cold War, the west had more access to titanium dioxide then Russia. So you were supposed to be able to see, one of the reasons that the like behind the Berlin Wall, things looked kind of dingy and dim and not as saturated, was that their paints, as they got old, they would show through more. They didn’t have as much titanium dioxide or they weren’t using titanium dioxide, but the west was. So when you would walk through the Brandenburg Gate in the west, it would be all bright and beautiful and there was more color. It was because of that. That may be apocryphal, but I love the story so much that-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt works for me.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it’s even in food, right?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYeah. A lot of food, especially things like Oreo filling, I think they don’t use it anymore. Something like a lifesaver or like sprinkles on cupcakes. A lot of titanium dioxide in those. Pharmaceuticals, pills, like almost every pill, if you have pills in your medicine cabinet, a lot of it in that. Shaving cream, for sure, shaving cream is a big one. The porcelains, the things that if you walk around your kitchen and your bathroom, a lot of those surfaces and a lot of the small objects are, you will see TiO2 on that ingredient label.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow was titanium dioxide discovered?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nWell, titanium was actually discovered that the element, very common, ninth most common element in the Earth’s crust, discovered in the leat of a mill. That’s the little, the stream that you sort of cut the side channel from a river to go through a mill. Nobody knew what to do with it. Nobody knew what it was for. But in the late 1800s, an engineer named AJ Rossi was playing with it because he had encountered it trying to make steel from the iron-bearing oars of the Adirondacks. Nobody knew if you could use it to make that steel better. He started a company and thought he could. And to do it, he needed a lot of power to make the furnaces hot enough to make this work. So he went to what was sort of the Silicon Valley of the late 1800s, early 1900s, which was Niagara Falls.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause of all the power.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nBecause of all the power.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Okay. So the hydroelectric power.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nRight. So he was doing electrochemistry.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh cool.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nAnd this is the place where like union carbide started. If you wanted to do this weird magical chemistry that needed a lot of power, you could crack open minerals, crack open oars and mix them together in new weird ways. So there were all these companies that started up in Niagara Falls. His was one of them. But at one point in the process, one of the byproducts of the process was titanium dioxide would precipitate out as this beautiful, bright white powder. And Rossi was smart enough to know that there was a huge demand at that moment for something to replace what was the classic brightener – opacifier – in white pigment since antiquity. Which was lead.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were starting to discover the shortcomings of lead.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYes. But he sees this white-', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nHe sees the white-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n… and he goes, “Oh, I know what this could do potentially.”', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nAnd he mixes it with salad oil. And he puts his finger in it, runs it across a piece of paper. It’s this beautiful white, and he says, “Ah-ha, I got it. I got it.” And he starts a company. It gets sort of a suspended by World War I, but once that’s over, he’s the only guy in town. The Norwegians come up with a process too. And now there’s this way to make titanium dioxide and it becomes ubiquitous in human industry.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nHow big of an industry is titanium dioxide?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nIt varies, but I think right now it’s like a $4 billion a year industry and I forget the amounts. It’s some hundreds of two TEU cargo units a year. But that doesn’t seem like a lot if you know how much cash Apple has on hand or something. But minute amounts of it are in everything that we touch every day, almost everything that we touch every day. And so to me that makes it one of those invisible pieces of things that we touch that makes the world look the way it does.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSince it was discovered, there have been these various methods to make it. Tell me about that.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThe process that Rossi figured out and the one that was in place really until a little before World War II, was called the sulfide process. It’s really gross. It’s really dirty, it requires sulfuric acid, and it requires a fairly pure ore to turn into titanium dioxide and it’s not very efficient. So in the ’30s, a chemist named Paul Kubelka figured out a way to use hydrochloric acid. So the chloride process was born. A complicated industrial process that uses really big factories that look like steampunk kind of star destroyers, they’re fantastic. I got to visit one. They’re amazing. He figures that out. That process becomes de facto. You can use kind of dirtier ores and it’s more efficient. It’s a better way to make the stuff. And through various waves of acquisitions and purchases, this becomes the property of DuPont. So DuPont becomes the main purveyor of the chloride process, titanium dioxide for the world essentially. And that becomes sort of a de facto standard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo there’s continual evolution of how to make better and cleaner titanium dioxide. And this eventually leads to a big intellectual property case. So tell me about that and how that got started.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nSo in like the mid-2000s, DuPont goes to the FBI and says, listen, we’re pretty sure somebody has stolen our chloride process for making titanium dioxide. We’re pretty sure we know who, we’re pretty sure we know who he’s selling it to. The FBI, which has just started not by coincidence, an economic espionage office in Silicon Valley because Congress has just passed the First Economic Espionage Act, essentially because they are worried about the same thing DuPont is, which is that China is trying to take IP from American companies.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI see. Okay.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nSo DuPont goes to the FBI and says, we are pretty sure that this dude named Walter Liew is selling our chloride process for building factories, for making ore into titanium dioxide to the Chinese government.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd how did Walter Liew get his hands on the DuPont method?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nWalter Liew, according to later trial documents, just spoil that a little bit, found his way to a state dinner in China where he had kind of promised that he knew how to make stuff that was on a literal list that the Chinese government had said, ‘gosh, we’d sure like it if somebody could teach us how to do this stuff for Chinese industrial reasons. That’d be great,’ and they kind of showed him the list and he was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally can make you guys titanium dioxide.” With his buddy sort of nudge him going like, “Walter, we don’t know how to make titanium dioxide.” He was like, “It’s fine, we’re good, it’s fine.”', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nAnd what Liew eventually ended up doing, what the FBI eventually understood Liew to end up doing, was finding a couple of this is more disrespectful than I’m meaning to sound, but essentially finding a couple of disgruntled ex-DuPont employees, engineers who had helped develop and deploy the chloride process factories that DuPont could build in the US and other countries. Who had left the company unhappy and with their boxes of stuff. And with those, Liew started in the Mission, San Francisco, started a little storefront office where he’d like processed that information and sold it to the Chinese.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow does DuPont figure this out? And then how does the FBI start to stitch together the case?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nDuPont was cagey with how they figured it out. Even with the FBI. Or the FBI was cagey with me about how DuPont had told them. They figured DuPont has its own internal security. They’re very worried about this kind of stuff but they found out somehow and they said to the FBI, we think it’s this guy. And the FBI started surveillance and looked into both the people who Liew was working with on the east coast in Delaware, his office here, and eventually got enough evidence to say we are pretty sure that he’s the guy and we’re pretty sure that he’s about to have a meeting with his Chinese contacts on given day. And we’re pretty sure that they’re staying in a crummy hotel in Alameda. And they, in conjunction with a relatively new US attorney in San Francisco who really wanted to get some action out of this office, figured out how to mount a bi-coastal multi-place exercise search warrants on everybody all at once, hundreds of agents deployed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd I mean, is this the first case sort of executed in the Espionage Act?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nYeah. It was the first case prosecuted under the Economic Espionage Act.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And then, so what was the result? Was he convicted?', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nHe was convicted and is still in prison. They never found the money. The money that the Chinese government turned out had paid Walter and his family. And China has an active chloride process, titanium dioxide processing business now. Because they had this kind of crummier ore, and no way to make it into titanium dioxide. And now they do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause of Walter Liew.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nPerhaps.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPerhaps. Or maybe they figured it out on their own.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nMaybe. And yes, for a pigment, for a color. To be able to make a color.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd I just love the whole premise of the Vantablack story and this story. What I love about it is the idea of color as technology. I think that’s a strange notion to people.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nI think it’s a strange notion too. But let me ‘yes and’ you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nIt’s always been technology.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSure.', 'Adam Rogers:', '\\nThere’s the experience that a living thing will have of a colored world, of a world of color. Because a lot of the things that are alive on the planet have ways of interacting with the physics of the electromagnetic spectrum that include the part of it that we call visible. Because for us it’s the visible part. But there’s a moment in human history where we take, it’s probably iron ore, it’s probably ochre, right? Take this rock, crunch it up, mix it with trabecular fat from some animal’s backbone and smear it a home K wall or smear it on a thing that we make, not just to protect it against mosquitoes, which is possibly a thing that it does, not just to glue together the heft of an ax, which is another thing that may be ochre pulp does, to make a design. To evoke something. Probably red, although it might’ve been black and it might’ve been white. Whites the thing that doesn’t last as long as others. So it’s hard to know. And at that moment, our interaction with the colored universe becomes one of technic as well. It becomes a technological interaction.']], ['The Worst Video Game Ever', '01.28.20', 'Episode 387', ['Roman Mars: This is 99% Invisible.

The company was called Atari. Atari made many good games, until one day, in 1982, it made a bad one. A really bad one. A game so bad it has been called “the worst video game of all time.”', 'Lizzie Peabody: The video game was, “E.T.: The Extraterrestrial.” According to the myth, it was so bad, it put Atari out of business.

Did you believe that there were games buried in the desert?', 'Howard Scott Warshaw: I never believed that. Why would a company that’s strapped financially and is really failing and having a lot of trouble staying afloat, why would they spend extra money to go into the desert and bury, uh, something that supposedly is so worthless?

Um, people were utterly confused by what it was.', 'Lizzie Peabody: Well, adults may have been confused, but kids got it immediately. Because, for such cutting-edge technology, Atari was easy to use. There was a simple console that plugged into your TV and it was controlled by a joystick with a single red button.

Well, a lot of those third-party games were bad too.', 'Arthur Daemmrich: And so, Atari’s name gets associated with some really bad games that nobody really likes and that aren’t selling well.', 'Lizzie Peabody: What’s more, by 1983, programmers had reached the Atari console’s limits for memory and graphics.

But, it basically wiped out sales of home game sets.', 'Lizzie Peabody: The history books call it, “The Video Game Crash of 1983.” American video game sales dropped by over 90% from 1982 to 1986. No new game systems were introduced, and hardly any new games were created at all, until the late ‘80s. That’s when Japanese game companies Nintendo and Sega brought their consoles, and their famous characters, to the United States. But It would be nearly two decades before another American-made console would return to the market in any significant way, with Microsoft’s Xbox in 2001.', 'Arthur Daemmrich: So, there’s no question that when you have an economic downturn, you have a catastrophe, a natural disaster, there’s an effort to put a face on it.

Because “E.T. The Video Game” tells the story of something bigger than its own dirt-crusted case. It’s about the rise and fall of the company that pioneered video gaming in America; and although it’s not very old, it hints at the digital revolution that followed. It’s a piece of American history.', 'Drew Robarge: Uh, I was just afraid that if I didn’t act now, like, probably nobody else would have realized the significance of it.

My cargo: a load of imported watermelons. They had sailed on a container ship from Guatemala to South Florida where they were transferred by forklift onto big trucks driven by folks like me.

Traffic came to a screeching halt at the junction of I-75 and I-640. I got stopped in time, but the trucker behind me? Well, not so much. Boom. Shoot! Rear-ended. I took a minute to collect myself and walked to the back of the trailer to check first on the other driver. He said he was okay. Then I opened the vent hatch to check my load. What seconds before had been a perfectly picked personal watermelon was now prolapsing through its ruptured rind, down the crumpled exterior of what had once been the trailer’s stainless steel door and on to my trembling hand.

If you want to know what’s going on in the trucking world, this is a good place to start, but first, let’s cover some basics. There are 4.2 million Americans who hold a CDL. That’s a commercial driver’s license. A CDL allows us to drive a vehicle weighing over 26,000 pounds. Together, we move 70% of all domestic freight. Think of it, everything you see at the store, everything you buy online moves by truck at some point. Add it all up, we’re talking about a $700 billion industry, moving literally 55 billion pounds of stuff every day.

So on our first day at MATS, we find ourselves at the vintage maroon Peterbilt…', 'Mike Landis:', '\\n“I guess that’ll work. Is that all right?”', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\n… of someone who’s been at the center of so much of the protest.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nYeah, so my name’s Mike Landis from Lititz, Pennsylvania, a little Amish country town in Lancaster County. I got into trucking right out of high school pretty much. I got my CDL after I graduated. First time I got behind the wheel at the driving school at the local VoTech, it was all downhill from there.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nE-Logs are all about how truckers record their driving and working hours.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nSo yeah, we have what they call our hours of service, which is once you come on duty, you’re allowed 14 hours of working time. 11 of that 14 can be driving, but then you have to take 10 hours off before you can go back to work.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nSo every day you get 14 hours on duty and you have to take 10 hours off.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nProblem with that is, is that once you start your day, your clock for the day doesn’t stop.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nNow in the past, those hours were recorded in paper logbooks. Every driver kept a set of books in the cab, recorded their time with a pen on a four-line grid, and made that log available to inspectors and state patrol. Basically, you regulated yourself.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nSo to me, that’s important, because I was taught the old way of trucking. You do what you got to do to get the job done, but you sleep when you’re tired and you truck when you’re awake.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nIf you took a quick nap in your shift or ran a little over the time limit, you could juggle that, clerically, I mean.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nYou don’t turn into a zombie just because you’re five minutes past your time and fall asleep and drive off the side of the road.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nThat is, you could juggle it, until the electronic logging device.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nAnd basically what that does is it hooks into the computer on the motor of the truck and it records everything you do. How hard you’re on the throttle, how hard you’re on the brake, if you’re moving, if you’re stopped, your speed, the whole nine yards. It counts down every second of your day. So whereas before on a paper logbook, if you’re five minutes past your time pulling into the truck stop, nobody knew the difference. No harm, no foul. But now, I mean, I’ve seen people backed halfway in a parking spot and truck stops already because if they finished backing up their ELD is going to put them in violation to go another 50 feet to back the truck up into a parking spot.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nYeah. You hear stories like this all the time. Trucks beached like whales and the most godawful places because their drivers ran out of hours. You’ve probably seen those trucks yourself. That’s because, in December 2017, a new mandate came into effect requiring virtually all trucks on the road to run an electronic log.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nAnd to me, it’s a slap in the face. Driving a truck at 18 years old, I’m now 33, closing in on 2 million miles, I have a clean driving record. To me, that all comes down to the way I was taught. That comes down to the responsibility of knowing you’re operating an 80,000-pound machine, and the fact that they’re going to tell me that I need this thing in my truck to keep me safe on the road doesn’t sit well with me at all.', 'Man:', '\\n“Really, I hear you loud and clear. We do these Ohio-Texas-Florida triangles a lot. Denise’s stepmother is dying, she’s in a Louisiana nursing home, and we want to see her. She’s days away from dying, literally days away from dying, and I’m on an ELD. We stopped to see her and essentially we’ve got to say our goodbyes to her in about 45 minutes because our 14-hour clock is ticking. And I just had this moment of complete clarity that something’s got to give.”', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nYeah. And there’s a lot of people that will say, “Hey, that’s not true. They don’t force you to drive tired. They don’t force you to not take a shower, yada, yada, yada.” Well, I mean, you’re right. The thing doesn’t reach up and grab me and tell me I need to keep trucking, but the sad reality is, is they kind of do.”', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nNow, I should say here that Mike does not run an E-Log.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nThe reason my truck don’t need one is because the cutoff date is 2000 and newer need them and ’99 and older do not.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nSo his ’99 Peterbilt is just too old to connect to a computer. But Mike has done more than just to avoid the new regulation. He’s actually fighting it.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nSo we started the United States Transportation Alliance and the unique thing about us is that all of us are drivers that met through doing protest type stuff for the industry, and nobody out here that is making these rules or regulations, or pushing for rules or regulations have ever sat behind the wheel for any amount of time, and definitely not anytime recently. So when we go to DC and we go every month right now, we park our trucks, we meet with congressmen, and senators, and FMCSA.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nThat’s the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nTruckload carriers, we’ve met with the Teamsters. It’s been a pretty good thing and we were fortunate enough to help with the hours of service that are supposed to be changed. I’m actually expecting an announcement here at MATS for that.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nIn fact, the keynote speaker for the weekend is none other than Elaine Chao, the United States Secretary of Transportation.', 'Mike Landis:', '\\nSo we’re hoping that it has to do something with that. I realize things change with the times, and technology goes, and this, that and the other thing, but trucking is still trucking. And I chose, me personally, I chose to drive a truck because I grew up around trucks and I love trucks. And for me, it sounds kind of corny, but the other week I was invited to a concert by someone that we know, backstage and stuff. Afterwards we were hanging out and watching this guy up on stage, you could tell he was just in his zone. And I said, “The best way I could describe watching you on stage is like me riding across the California or Arizona desert with the truck pressed out, and the moonlit, and the chicken lights on, and just pipe singing and cruising.” And some people are like, “What? I don’t get it. You’re just driving a truck down the road.” And I’m like, “Yeah, but to me, it’s more than just driving a truck down the road, it’s the freedom of it, and that’s kind of being taken away is what the bad part is. If we don’t do anything to help fight this stuff, guys like me are going to be gone.', 'Paul Marhoefer:', '\\nAfter the break, we’ll hear that big announcement from Elaine Chao, but first, we venture out onto the parking lot at MATS. We’ll hear why this E-Log thing is such a big deal, and I’ll tell you what gave for me and how ELD has led, at least indirectly, to the making of this podcast.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou’re listening to “Over the Road” on 99% Invisible.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars: Here again is “Over the Road.”', 'Todd Dills:', '\\nHey folks, Todd Dills here.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat if I told you that there was a piece of technology that could do away with traffic jams, make cities more equitable and help us solve climate change? You might think about driverless cars or hyperloops or any of the other new transportation technologies that get lots of hype these days. But my guest on the show this week has written a whole book about a much older, much less sexy piece of machinery, one that he thinks could be the key to making our cities more sustainable, more livable and more fair. Be humble. Omnibus. We just call it a bus now.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSteven Higashide is a transit expert, bus champion, and author of a new book called “Better Buses, Better Cities.” And the central thesis of the book is that buses have the power to remake our cities for the better. But he says, if we want the bus to reach its potential, we’re going to have to make the experience of riding one a lot more pleasant.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nAmericans take 4.7 billion trips a year on the bus. But so many of those trips are miserable. They’re slow, they’re circuitous. You’re standing on the side of the road, sometimes not even with a sidewalk or a shelter. So it’s really a miserable experience. And yet public transit is the most efficient way to move people around. It’s essential if we are going to defeat climate change.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo why is the bus a key to the issue of climate change and what is its role as an environmental technology as much as the transit technology?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSo transportation is now the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US and so that means, on the one hand, it does mean that we have to look at electrifying automobiles. But at the same time, when you look at climate modeling, whether that’s at a municipal level, state level, or national level, you just see that electrification is not going to be enough to meet our climate goals. And that means we have to build cities and neighborhoods where people don’t have to drive as often. And they have to be able to make shorter trips. And so public transit plays a huge role in that and buses play a really essential role in that as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCan you talk a little bit about how efficient buses can be in terms of moving the most number of people around a city and what are the environmental impacts of that?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSo the typical lane of general-purpose traffic in the city – a typical car lane – can carry perhaps a thousand to 2000 people an hour. If you have a bus-only lane that jumps up to four to 8,000 people per hour. So that’s far more efficient. And if you are giving over more of the street to transit and creating a transitway, now we’re talking 10 to 25,000 people per hour. And it’s really that fundamental geometry which makes transit so essential to cities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think when most people think of a future that’s a more green future, they think of wind farms and solar arrays. They don’t necessarily think of a bus.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nYeah, I mean the bus is very overlooked, but I think that if more people went to cities where bus service was convenient, it’d be pretty eye-opening. I personally was radicalized by taking the bus in London where it seemed like practically every trip I wanted to make, the fastest way to do it was via bus. And sometimes that would be two or even three buses. But the transfers were so convenient. The service was so frequent that I really experienced it as a seamless thing. And you know, maybe that’s a little bit of the rose-colored eyes of someone who is visiting. I know people in London are going to have their complaints about transit. It’s actually really hard to praise transit anywhere because local people know that there are always a lot of problems. But still, it was an eye-opening experience.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nWe don’t have a huge number of good examples in the US so I think it’s a little hard for Americans to understand. But I’ve had this experience also on some of the buses in Toronto where I open my phone to look at whether I should bike or take Uber or take the bus and so many of the trips there I opened my phone up and taking the bus was faster than Uber, which is so different from when I’m trying to get around in US cities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo why haven’t we embraced the bus in the United States?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nI think there are a few reasons for that. The first is that in the US I think often there is this obsession with technology and this idea that we are going to innovate our way out of traffic. And you see that when you see the amount of hype there is for driverless vehicles or Hyperloop. You know Elon Musk proposed a Hyperloop for Chicago that was going to carry 2000 people an hour, which is actually much less than you can carry in a regular bus. And then a lot of it comes down to political power and the fact that most people who ride buses in the US today are lower income. They are people of color. These are folks who have always been, to a large extent, shut out of the political system and a lot of what it takes to make transit better involves organizing those riders and building a new kind of transportation politics.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd there also seems to be a bit of an effort to change perception. Like if you watch a movie and something bad happens to a protagonist and they lose a job or something bad happens to them, the next scene might be them on a bus and it’s like a defeat almost.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nIn US media, there’s this real class valence to buses. In the show “Atlanta”, one of the early scenes is the main protagonist, on the bus, sort of complaining that his life hasn’t gone the way that he wanted it to. And there’s this real association between the bus and not making it. And it’s funny how much that doesn’t exist when you look at popular media in Asia or the UK where the bus is just like a park or a sidewalk. There are a lot of scenes with buses that don’t seem to have any special significance because the bus is just part of the ordinary fabric of life and it doesn’t have some broader connotation and in a lot of ways that’s where we need to get in the US, where the bus is just something that lots of people use when it happens to work out for them. And because we’ve designed buses well, it works out well for people in a much wider set of circumstances.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat do you think is the most direct way to improve that perception of the bus and make people want to ride it?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThe most direct way to improve the perception of buses is just to make the buses themselves better.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nBecause you make buses better and more people start riding. More people start riding, that changes the perception of the bus. It creates the political energy to improve the bus even more and it’s this sort of virtuous cycle. And so I really think it doesn’t start with marketing or communications or some new framing. It starts with actually creating a product that you can sell to people with a straight face.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf the way to get more people to ride the bus is to make the bus service better, then city planners would do well to read Steven’s book. It’s basically a manual for how to improve bus systems. Drawing from examples from cities around the country where design decisions made riding the bus better for everyone. Steven says that one of the most fundamental things you can do to improve bus service is just to make the bus run more frequently.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThere’s this saying that the transit planner Jared Walker often uses, which is that “frequency is freedom”. Imagine if you own a car and there’s like this giant wall behind the car that only opens once an hour and that’s the only time that you can leave your house and go driving. That’s basically what it’s like if you live near an hourly bus route and it’s not much better if you live near a half-hourly bus route. It’s only when you get to this stage where you have service every 15 minutes, every 10 minutes, every five minutes, that there’s this real sense of freedom that you’re not planning your life around someone else’s schedule anymore. You can just show up whenever you want and feel confident that the bus is going to be there pretty soon. So frequency creates a sort of seamlessness and a kind of freedom that is really important and that frequency is also really important to make networks work.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nIt’s not really possible to give every single person a door-to-door ride on a bus. That’s sort of the opposite of transit. Transit is taking lots of people from roughly the same place to roughly similar destinations. And one of the ways that you do that really effectively in a network is by creating a grid, by creating frequent connections, where you have to have the confidence that if you get on a bus and you get off somewhere else to transfer, that’s going to be a pretty seamless transfer. You don’t want to have to worry that you’re going to have to get off at some intersection and then be standing around for 25 minutes in who knows what sort of environment. So that’s what makes frequent service so important.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so step one is just to make the bus more frequent. That makes sense. And in the book, step two is also pretty intuitive and that’s to make the bus go faster. Now obviously we’re not talking about giving the bus a stronger engine or making sure the bus drivers speed stop to stop. But you’re talking about freeing the bus from traffic. So how can planners do that?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nYeah, there’s quite a varied toolkit that cities and transit agencies have when they want to speed up the bus. Some very small things like how you place the bus stop makes a big difference. For example, if the bus stop is in front of the traffic light, that is going to tend to slow the bus down because it’s more likely that the bus is going to get caught by a red light. Whereas if you put the bus stop after the traffic light, that tends to be faster. Another thing that makes a big difference is how far apart bus stops are from each other, which I think is pretty intuitive. And then there’s even how riders get on the bus. The general rule of thumb in the US is that people have to line up in this pretty long line, often at the front of the bus and board one by one.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nAnd on busy routes, what transit agencies should be doing is all-door boarding where you can get on at any door. Maybe you tap your card at a reader on the back of the bus and that can cut the delay down from five seconds a person to more like two seconds a person, which really adds up when you’re talking about 20 people getting on at a given stop. And then what we really need in the most congested areas of our cities are bus-only lanes or even bus-only streets, which you’re starting to see in places like New York City and San Francisco and Seattle, where at the busiest times, private automobiles are more or less banned and buses get the right of way.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo in terms of bus-only streets, just recently here in the Bay area, San Francisco banned private cars on Market Street and that’s still brand new, but I know they did something similar in Manhattan.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCan you describe that effort?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nIn the last few months, New York City has essentially banned cars on 14th street and this is an enormous advertisement for the bus and it’s an enormous advertisement for what cities can be like when we prioritize transit and don’t give over every bit of street space to the private car. If you walk around 14th Street today and see the bus wait in action, what’s amazing is not only is the transit fast, but the neighborhood is so much nicer. It’s so much quieter without all the cars. You can see ambulances have a clear shot and aren’t getting stuck in traffic. Trucks are allowed on this transitway, so it’s actually very convenient for the businesses that are on this corridor and people feel safe and empowered to cross the street basically anywhere because there’s so much less traffic. So it’s a much more pleasant place to be and we can create more neighborhoods like that when we move the car to the margins and have great transit in its place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs there always this antagonistic relationship between cars and bus systems?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nI do think that there has been and will continue to be tension between cars and the city because, fundamentally, you cannot scale up an automobile-based system of transportation and fit it into a city and have it work for everyone. In the early 20th century, I think a lot of people realized that the car was doing great harm to the fabric of cities. And there’s a lot of important history to read about the ways in which, for example, public opinion was really against automobiles and the violence that they brought into cities. I think we have to keep in mind, sometimes urbanists talk with a little bit of hyperbole about banning cars, which I think is very appropriate right now in specific neighborhoods. But we have to reckon with the fact that in a lot of the sprawling US, transit just doesn’t get you the same access to jobs and opportunities that cars do. And the solution to that is really scaling up and creating great transit. But I do think that there is some tension there and we do have to find ways to roll back the dominance of the automobile in our cities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think it’s interesting to think about the entire network that hooks into the bus, and one of the things you mentioned is that you also have to make the experience of getting to and from the bus easier and integrate that into the system that we’re talking about. So how does that play a role in creating a vibrant and functional bus system?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThe walking experience really matters when it comes to transit. I mean most people are walking on at least one end of their trip. And so the pedestrian experience really is the transit experience, and you can provide someone with a bus that is frequent and fast and reliable, but if their experience when they get off the bus is that they have to cross an eight-lane road and there’s not a sidewalk and there’s nowhere to wait, they’re not going to experience that as a great transit experience.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSo this is really important and it also is hard and frustrating because almost always the entity that controls sidewalks and the walking experience is different from the government agency that is providing bus service. So there’s a lot of work that has to happen to develop those relationships, to create some sort of regular process. Walkability is a huge problem in America. You go to Austin, Nashville, Denver, these are all places that have like $1 billion backlog in sidewalks. Where huge amounts of the street network don’t have sidewalks. And even in places like Philadelphia and New York, you see these huge lawsuits because curb ramps aren’t sufficient for people. So I really think walkability is this urban crisis, which we don’t talk about that much and it definitely has an impact on public transit.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo another way to improve bus service is to make it more equitable and safe. So how do you go about making it so that everyone feels comfortable riding the bus?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nI think a lot of times transit agencies look at survey data showing that people are worried about their personal safety on transit, which is a major reason why people don’t ride or a major reason why people stop riding. But transit agencies see that safety is a concern and often they very quickly go to policing as the answer. And that is one solution that makes some riders feel safe. But, it can also make riders feel less safe and you don’t want to create an environment where people feel like by getting on transit could have implications for their immigration status or it could lead to them being embroiled in the criminal justice system. And there are a lot of aspects of safety, whether that’s lighting, station design, human presence, which may or may not be law enforcement.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThese are really things where conversations have to happen at the community level, where you have to have this conversation about what is the community definition of safety and sort of not just assume what the answer is. And then I also think when it comes to equity, fares are really important. How we pay for transit, how much, and whether people are really being treated equally. And let me just give a couple of examples.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSo a lot of transit agencies, it actually turns out that wealthier transit riders pay less because there’s a discount for a monthly pass. Whereas low-income riders can’t afford to pay for that monthly pass upfront. So instead they’re paying 2.50 every time they get on and it adds up to much more than the cost of the monthly pass over time. So one thing that a few transit agencies have started doing is something called fare capping where, if you’re paying by the ride, once you get to that level where it’s at the same level as the monthly pass, all your rides are free for the rest of the month after that. So it’s like no one ends up paying more than the cost of that monthly pass.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou mentioned one of the things about the frequency is everyone getting on all the doors available. And I think this leads to people thinking about fare evasion and is fare evasion really a problem? Part of my brain thinks that this cannot possibly be a problem, like it really costs that much or causes that big of a problem. What is your take on that and how it fits in with the stuff you’ve been thinking about?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSure. I mean I think it’s really important to take a customer-focused approach to fare evasion. When you look at bus fare evasion, you have to confront the fact that in most places it’s actually kind of hard to pay for the bus. If you pay in cash on some systems, you have to pay via exact change. It can be very unclear where to buy a transit pass. When researchers looked at this in Washington DC, they found that the neighborhoods where rates of fare evasion were the highest were places where there was a lot of poverty and also no store where transit passes were sold. This really tells us a couple of things. First that if you criminalize fare evasion, to some extent you are criminalizing poverty, which isn’t equitable and you also oftentimes are punishing people for the shortcomings of your own user experience.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nIt should be the case that if you want to load your transit pass, it should be really obvious where to do that. Whether that’s on an app, whether that’s at a convenience store, it should be really obvious, but in most places, it isn’t. And I think you also have to ask yourself if people aren’t paying the fare because they literally can’t afford it. It’s not like transit agencies are missing out on huge amounts of revenue. If you crackdown, that just means people aren’t going to ride and it means that they’re not going to get to work or to healthcare or make the trips that they need to make.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMore about making cities better by having better buses, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the things that struck me when talking to Steven is that we have the technology we need to make our cities more livable and more sustainable, the problem is that we just aren’t making the best use of that technology.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nWe talk so much about technological innovation in transportation, when the real innovation that is needed is innovation in governance or innovation in the public process so that we can build the transit projects much more quickly. One of the things that I write about in the book is the unfortunate fact that a lot of bus lane projects are designed in a way that is like a highway megaproject with multiple rounds of design and dozens of public meetings and you end up with a situation where it can take six or eight or in some cases even 10 years to put a bus lane on the street. And we just don’t have that time if we want our cities to be sustainable.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThere’s a lot of innovation that can happen in the public process to make these projects happen more quickly. And in fact, cities like Boston and now Washington DC and other places are adopting something called ‘tactical transit,’ where they will put some cones on the street or just paint the street and test out a bus lane and measure the actual performance and survey riders. And the whole process takes maybe a few weeks or a few months instead of multiple years.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. That seems to be like one of the great advantages of the bus is that as a design solution, it’s quite flexible, it’s not on rails. It has all the good things that a transit system has. It has lots of capacity for people, but if you need it to turn the corner of one block before the route that you’ve done for the past 10 years, the driver just turns the wheel, it’s a matter of just telling the driver to do it and letting everyone know. It seems like a designer’s dream to have that type of ability to iterate and be flexible.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nYeah. A lot of what we have to do in cities is actually realize that promise. Planners talk about the bus being flexible, but then you look at Columbus not redesigning the bus network in 40 years and you ask yourself, “Well, how flexible is it really?” In the US, I feel like you see a lot of business boosters and economic development advocates call for world-class transit and what they mean is that they want a streetcar or something. And then when you actually go and look at world-class transit networks, it’s robust bus service that then feeds into rail, but buses are sort of like the capillaries of the transit system reaching out to every place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat is the cost of us not investing in the bus system?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nThe cost of cities not investing in buses is deepening in equality. In new Orleans for example, for folks who live in New Orleans and have access to a car, you can access 80-90% of jobs in the city within a half hour. If you are walking and taking transit that declines to 10%, 15%, 20%. It’s such a smaller life. And if cities don’t invest in buses, if they don’t invest in transit, they really are pushing particularly low-income households into this really hard place where they feel compelled to buy a car because that’s the only way to get access to opportunity, but that car ends up being a financial trap of its own. We are at a point in the US where automobile debt is at the highest levels recorded in history and it’s just not financially sustainable, so there are better ways and the bus is a huge part of it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd even to the extent that because the bus can be so limited, it limits people’s ability to participate in democracy.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nIn the book, I cite some work that’s been done by Professor Otto, at CUNY, at the City University of New York, and he relates this story where he was talking with some folks on the bus in the Hudson Valley here in New York and there are these plans to change the bus system there and folks on the bus are talking amongst themselves as to whether the changes are going to be good for them and it’s this really rich discussion. So the bus driver says, “Oh, you guys really have some good ideas. You should go to city hall and let them know what you have to say.” And the bus riders just dismiss this immediately, because the buses stop running at a time where if they go to city hall and testify, they’re not going to be able to get back home because the buses aren’t running anymore. And so it’s not just access to jobs that we have to think about, it’s access to civic participation, it’s access to food, it’s access to church, it’s access to libraries, it’s access to all the things that we really need to live our full lives. That’s really what’s at stake here when we talk about buses and public transit.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo why don’t we finish up by talking about Houston, one of the cities you profiled in the book. And what struck me about this case study is that the city really dreamed big and really went for it. Can you describe Houston’s approach and how it differs from the way cities usually do things?', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nSure. So the typical way that bus routes change is sort of a tweak here and a tweak there, which sort of adds up over the years, sometimes into these routes that squiggle all over the place and there’s not a single person who can really tell you why. What was really radical about the approach taken in Houston, which has been emulated in many other cities at this point, is that they designed the network from scratch. They sort of realized that the bus network had become less and less relevant to people and in a lot of ways hadn’t fundamentally changed in decades so it wasn’t really something that was worth building on. So instead they asked if we were designing this from scratch based on what we know today about how demographics are changing, about where the job centers are in Houston today, what would that system look like? And so they drew it that way and the result was a system that put a million additional jobs and a million additional households within walking distance of frequent transit. It’s really quite an accomplishment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat seems like such an accomplishment that more people should know about it, but all I tend to read about in terms of transportation stories are new fancy things and just new technologies.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nI think that there’s a secret reason why a lot of people in the transportation space focus on technological innovation and that’s because they’re shying away from their own responsibility and they’re hoping that the private market is going to solve the problem, but what private transportation companies have given us are boutique services for the well-off and what we need is affordable widespread transit and that requires public champions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, and also it requires public champions and also an acceptance that it’s never done. I feel like there’s this idea that there’s this technological Holy Grail which will solve the problem and therefore, then the problem is solved. Whereas this isn’t a problem like that. This is just a problem of maintenance and care and thinking about the city and what your constituency is. It just seems like it’s a different mindset than the Silicon Valley mindset.', 'Steven Higashide:', '\\nYeah, I think that’s a great point. Cities are changing and transit systems have to adapt to meet that and I think a lot of what I write about in the book, a lot of what’s really important is actually the role of the public sector and creating public agencies that are strong and responsive and have the capacity to be able to do something, like build a pipeline of projects, or to plan and implement bus priority projects across the city, or to do public engagement in a way that is real and not check the box and work very closely with neighborhood-based organizations. These all require hiring people and hiring people with skills and undoing this hollowing out of the public sector that I think exists in a lot of places. I think we have to be open to what might seem to some to be radical, but which I don’t think it’s radical at all to call for tripling the amount of bus service or quadrupling the amount of bus service that we provide in most cities. I think the experience elsewhere shows that we could do that and people would use it.']], ['Shade', '01.14.20', 'Episode 385', ['Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is 99% Invisible.

This is the fight of our lives.”', 'News Anchor:', '\\n“Mayor Eric Garcetti in South Los Angeles today, rolling out key elements of his Cool Streets Program.”', 'Eric Garcetti:', '\\n“This is the first of five neighborhoods across the city where we’re rolling out new features that’ll help us lower our temperatures.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe city is trying lots of things to cool down temperatures like painting sidewalks white. But the easiest way to solve this problem is shade, just creating shade. Lots of neighborhoods in LA don’t have tree coverage or high rise buildings, and because of city bylaws, it’s really difficult to build features like shade sails or canopies. Journalist Sam Bloch has spent a lot of time looking into shade so I sat down to talk with him about why shade is actually a matter of life or death for people living in really sunny places.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo you used to live in Los Angeles and what did you notice about Los Angeles when you started walking around the city?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nWhat did I notice? I noticed that there was no one around. I noticed that the people who were around would have to position themselves in such a way to protect themselves from the sunlight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat do you mean?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nI noticed people waiting for the buses behind telephone poles, and I noticed people waiting behind the people waiting behind telephone poles because there was only that small sliver of shade that people were protected from the sunlight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhy is shade so important?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nLos Angeles, like almost every city in the world, is heating up. There are some scientists who I speak to who have found that in hot, dry, arid environments like Los Angeles, but also Phoenix, that shade is the most important factor when it comes to human comfort – more than air temperature, more than humidity, more than wind speed, and there’s a close relationship between human thermal comfort and mortality and illness and heat stroke. If you don’t have shade, if you’re not protected from the sun, you can become dizzy, you can become disoriented, you can become confused, lethargic, dehydrated. If you are obese or elderly or pregnant, that can tip into more dangerous things like heart attack or organ failure.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so what is the magnitude of the problem in LA?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nThere are a few different ways of thinking about it. We can talk about shade in terms of tree canopy, which is a very serious problem. Los Angeles has terribly unequal tree canopy and by tree canopy I just mean coverage. Let’s say you’re an outer space looking down on LA, you’ll see parts of the city that are covered in green, and you’ll see parts of the city that are not, that are baking in asphalt, and those, to a tee, follow lines of wealth. It’s a problem with tree canopy. It’s a problem in terms of the built urban form. Los Angeles is notoriously anti-density. Los Angeles has this image of itself as not being New York City. In fact, being the anti-New York City. So sunlight and open space is a part of the culture, and that’s not necessarily a problem, but it becomes a problem when you can’t escape it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So there are no tall buildings to provide some measure of shade?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nI wouldn’t go as far as to say there are no tall buildings. However, there are a few tall buildings-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd they are spaced pretty far apart.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nCorrect. They’re located in certain height districts, Downtown being one of them. And even some areas that city planners have designated to be taller neighborhoods. Even today, there’s still fought and contested by neighborhood activists.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’ve seen old pictures and I get a sense that Los Angeles used to be greener, like there was a lot of shade. So tell me how the city was designed and how it developed into this.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nSo was Los Angeles was a Prairie. If you look at photos of LA from 150 years ago, it’s all grasslands. And when it was settled by the Spanish, downtown – which was the original settlement – was laid out according to the ‘Law of the Indies’. The city would roughly conform to a 45-degree angle, so you could have sunlight in the winter and shade and shadow in the summer.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo explain the Law of the Indies. What does this mean?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nThe Law of the Indies means build your cities at 45 degrees basically – completely unlike the way we think of most American cities, which have this North-South-East-West, very rigid grid. So you have these original settlements that are laid out in such a way as to be able to create shadow when you need it and also to bestow sunlight also when you need it. Spanish architecture tends to have a very strong sense of natural comfort, so you’ll see a lot of these kinds of missions and adobes that have these internal courtyards that are shaded, you’ll have covered walkways, paseos, and even today you’ll see a lot of this in Spanish revival architecture or outdoor malls that have goofy Spanish-ish names.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nLos Angeles was also in a way a dusty old west town. So you think about these covered boardwalks, you think about large canvas awnings that are cooling people who are living outside and also cooling indoors, which at the time didn’t have air conditioning. And another way that Los Angeles tried to stay cool was through rich, beautiful, flamboyant, not just tree canopy, but a syncretic overwhelming variety of exotic flora and fauna.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo during this period, there was a recognition of the environment and how to be comfortable inside of it. And when did that go wrong?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nFunny that you put it that way. Things started to go wrong after cheap electricity came down to Los Angeles with the completion of what’s now called the Hoover Dam. So you start to see the city rebuild itself and the new development becomes like we see today. You have controlled air conditioning, you have the automobile which comes to dominate the city in the 30s in the 40s, and with the automobile, you just have a whole new way of seeing the city.', 'Archival Clip:', '\\n“The names of the streets are household words translated into magic. Fabulous stacks of freeways, tremendous tone-wise.”', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nThe city started to think about how to market itself and how to make itself seem more attractive to outsiders. And this is where you get palm trees. Palm trees one essayist said ‘were about as useful for shade as a telephone pole’. She hated them, but the city was enamored of them. And interestingly, you have different philanthropists and celebrities starting to think about trees as being a public good, but the palm tree, in particular, being one that doesn’t just message LA as a semi-tropical paradise, but also as Mary Pickford said, it’s very good for window shopping from the seat of your car because the tree trunks aren’t that robust. So if you’re driving down some Boulevard, you can see all the great stuff because the palm tree is so narrow.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nSo Los Angeles was also rezoned in the 1930s to become a single-family city. Los Angeles in order to – not pacify, not suck up – but to remake itself in the image of the FHA, decided that all new single-family homes had to come with a front and a side yard. So you start to create a lot of space around them. Los Angeles really starts to hate the idea of density.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so when you have this type of sprawling, not very dense city, how was the shade distributed?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nUnevenly. Shade is distributed to people who can afford it. If you go into these neighborhoods that were laid out to be wealthy residential enclaves, you have very wide sidewalks, and the strip of grass where you can tree plant, which is called the parkway becomes four or five, maybe even 10 feet wide. And when you have these wider parkways, you have a greater space to plant a bigger, thicker leafier tree.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo the Parkway is the area between the sidewalk and the road, and those can be pretty wide and, therefore, have trees with them?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nCorrect. In other neighborhoods that have been redlined, that were designed as worker housing that were meant to jam people in together, you don’t have these kinds of wide residential sidewalks, instead of what you have are very narrow sidewalks because these neighborhoods are designed to facilitate automobile passage. So if you have a narrow sidewalk, you don’t really have the space to plant a thick leafy tree. Furthermore, it’s been incumbent upon property owners and renters to maintain this semi-public space of the parkway. You would think that in a city, whatever is on the sidewalk, whatever is outside of the property line would be managed by the city. That is not historically been the case in Los Angeles. It’s been incumbent upon property owners to water trees to maturity and to maintain them. If there’s a tree there, it’s because someone has taken it upon themselves to water it to maturity and to care for it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo each part of that process, the design of where the sidewalk is relative to the street, the fact that a person of wealth could plant and maintain a tree, all of these things cause more uneven distribution of shade trees.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nThat’s right. And I would also add that in some neighborhoods, I’m thinking about a neighborhood called Hancock Park, which is a flat neighborhood, landlocked in the center of the city. There is nothing about it that naturally lends itself to being a lush verdant tree festooned paradise. But the neighborhood was developed as an exclusive wealthy residential enclave and when that happened, the power lines were undergrounded. There is nothing in the way. It is designed specifically to allow for tree growth. This is not the case in most of Los Angeles.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo because of this lack of shade trees, there’ve been efforts to build in shade, especially around bus shelters. But it’s been incredibly hard according to your reporting. So like in your article you talk about one bus shelter at Glassell Park. Could you tell me about that and why it was so hard to put shade there?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nIt was hard because shade is a tripwire. In the instance of the Glassell Park Transit Island, you had a concerned neighborhood resident and a neighborhood activist or maybe you’ll call them a homeowner who wanted to throw just a simple bus shelter over a space where she saw people naturally congregating. She ended up talking to an architect who said, let’s not do a regular bus shelter. Let’s throw some big shade sails in here. And when that happens, you have to start thinking about how are we going to fix these shade sails to the ground. And when that happens, you have to start thinking about what’s underneath the ground. And you have water mains, you have underground utilities. In order to upgrade a sidewalk or a Transit Island, you then have to start honoring newer regulations like the Americans with disabilities act. So then you have to start making curb cuts to make it wheelchair accessible. So you have to take care of all these other things before you can decide to do this very lightweight, sort of low-res fix.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe enemies of shade are not always bad guys. In this case, ADA compliance is not a bad guy.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nNo.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike curb cuts, not a bad guy. All these things are not bad. It’s not just sort of around sidewalks. LA doesn’t have a lot of shading in city parks either. So why is that? Why was this never considered valuable?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nI wouldn’t go as so far as to say it was never considered valuable because I’m thinking about a park downtown called Pershing Square that up until the 1950s was a tropical paradise. It was incredibly shady. It was meant for people to kind of hang out and shoot the breeze and after awhile the business elite in the neighborhood decided first of all to install underground parking, which gets rid of the whole root system so you can no longer plant thicker, denser tree canopy and part of the reason why Pershing Square was redeveloped in short of its tree canopy is because Los Angeles is a city where residents are worried about crime, a city where residents are worried about homelessness. As I was working on this story, I came across multiple instances where LAPD had installed pole cameras in parks or in public housing projects. And I had been told about something called crime prevention through environmental design, which is this idea that we need to have increased visibility in public spaces. And you can go on Google Street View and go back five, six, seven years and you can see over time when a pole camera goes up, a mature street tree goes down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo there’s all these selective pressures where other things are just more important like whether it’s, I would call it somewhat the illusion of crime prevention-', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nCorrect. No one told me that it actually prevents crime. What this detective told me was that it helps the police catch and prosecute criminals. Not that it stops them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And then this preference for this underground parking, which makes a shallow ground, which therefore you can only have trees that have ball root systems like palm trees. It just seems like everything is working against it, especially in this city. And so how do you think about how to balance these different factors and their value in an urban setting?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nGreat question. There are a few ways to think about this. I mentioned that in Los Angeles, it’s homeowners and residents who are responsible for the maintenance and cultivation of street trees. Why does it have to be that way? Why doesn’t the city decide that a public urban forest, why isn’t that a value? You might also think about the question of density. I spoke to an architect and what he told me is that maximizing floor space is the name of the game, which means if you only have so much space to work with, which developer is going to say, “Let’s actually carve out some of our floor space to make an arcade or a Portico.” That’s a tough sell. So why doesn’t the city properly incentivize developers to create these sort of semi-public shaded environments behind the property line that are contiguous with the sidewalk?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what about just placing trees? I mean, what is LA doing about just adding to the canopy in general?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nThe city is trying to plant more trees. The city has a goal of planting 90,000 trees in the next few years. I am not sufficiently convinced that the city recognizes the infrastructural challenge to planting 90,000 trees because as we’ve been talking about, the space in which you can plant a tree is limited when you have things like a narrow sidewalk or overhead power lines or even regulations that limit or prohibit the planting of a street tree within 45 feet of a driveway, which let’s be real, that’s practically all of Los Angeles. That makes me think that the city is not understanding the complete wholesale re-imagining of the street that’s needed in order to plant 90,000 trees.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’ve talked a lot about informal urbanism in this show and sort of interventions. People could install umbrellas and canopies without permission to fix this kind of problem just in their own neighborhood. Did you find evidence of people doing this and what is the reaction when this happens?', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nPeople do it all the time. Particularly I will add in Latino neighborhoods. There’s an urbanist named James Rojas who writes about Latino Urbanism. And he has a pretty compelling theory that Latino residents of Los Angeles know how to use the shade and he leads these wonderful walking tours where he’ll point out shade sails that have been connected between two garages and an alleyway for kids to play in because it’s more comfortable under the shade. Or he’ll point out these elaborate front yards where you have blue poly tarps just strung across a space. Or maybe I’m exotic trees that are sort of overflowing into the street.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, that sounds great to me, but I get the impression that the city doesn’t always see things the same way.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nWhat I did find is that in the private realm, those things are tolerated when they step into the public and when they step onto the sidewalk, things become more complicated. I write about a grassroots shade shelter on Figueroa and Avenue 26 in the Cypress Park neighborhood near the LA River. And a barber named Tony Cornado would not admit that it was he who made this really great, fantastic shade shelter made out of like an I-beam and a great tarp and a couple of bus benches. But he told me that he recognized the need for people when they’re waiting for the bus just to have some protection. Tony or someone had to take down this grassroots bus shelter because it was an obstruction in the public right of way. The city processes 16,000 obstructions in the public right of way every year. If property owners, if residents, did not fear that the city would come after them, threatening them with fines, perhaps we would see more grassroots urbanism.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think it’s pretty surprising to think of shade as a political inequity issue. I think it surprises a lot of people. Tell me about your awakening of this and convincing people of it and just make your best case for what it is that you want people to think about when they think about shade in a city.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nShade in a city is to me respect for people who can’t afford to duck into an air-conditioned cafe or a lift when it gets too hot. Shade is to me, an understanding that the world is changing and we want to protect citizens, the most vulnerable citizens who can’t protect themselves, and it’s also just nicer to be in the shade. It’s cooler in the shade. I always walk on the shady side of the street. It’s easier to see in the shade. You know, I spoke to a scientist who said that direct sunlight is the kind of light that you have when you perform oral surgery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s not pleasant.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nNo. Dappled light is more like reading a book. So I want my city to help me read a book. I don’t want to perform oral surgery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Thanks for coming in. I appreciate that.', 'Sam Bloch:', '\\nYeah. Thanks for having me, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSam Bloch’s article called ‘Shade’ appeared in Places Journal.']], ['The Weather Machine', '03.03.20', 'Episode 392', ['Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAndrew Blum is a journalist who writes about some of the biggest infrastructure projects in the world. His specialty is revealing how systems we think of as intangible, like the internet, are actually made up of very real stuff. The internet relies on cables and wires and data centers which are maintained by actual people who keep the whole thing running. A few years back, Andrew got interested in the weather forecast. It’s this mundane everyday service, that like the internet, is made possible by a vast and interconnected global machine that took decades to build. This system is a huge scientific project, but it’s also a diplomatic one. The atmosphere crosses all political boundaries. And so, knowing the weather requires international collaboration. As weather becomes more extreme, the forecast becomes increasingly important. But ironically because of its growing value, there are now forces threatening to undermine the global system that makes it possible. It is fascinating stuff. I talked to Andrew about his book, ‘The Weather Machine,’ and he told me that he first got interested in the forecast back in 2012.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nIt was a kind of busy season for me. My first book had come out, my dog had died, my son was born. It all kind of happened at once and there was a weekend afternoon, a kind of Sunday in October when I had my kind of newborn in one hand and my phone in the other. And I was on Twitter and all of a sudden the meteorologist who I followed kind of went into a tizzy. They all just kind of erupted all at once based on the output of a weather model. And what they were seeing was a storm that they had kind of been watching out in the Atlantic and the Southern Atlantic, but suddenly it was going to turn left towards New York where I live.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd it was remarkable because this was eight days ahead. This was a big storm, potentially. And they all kind of trusted the output of this model. They weren’t saying this is definitely going to happen, but it was so far ahead of sort of what I understood as the work of meteorologists, especially kind of hurricane forecasters.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this storm that you could kind of see eight days out eventually became Hurricane Sandy.', 'News Report:', '\\n“It is chaos along the Jersey shore.”', 'News Report:', '\\n“The superstorm already stretching across one-third of this country from Florida to Canada.”', 'News Report:', '\\n“I came to ABC News, I covered New York weather for 25 years. I have never seen water in lower Manhattan. There is water now on the streets in lower Manhattan.”', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nI mean the overall feeling when the storm actually came was that our kind of luck had run out, that New York city had sort of finally begun to reckon with what the storms of the future might be like. With the subways flooded and shut down, nobody did anything for that week. Along the coast, it was months and years and if you live on the L train, that’s still being fixed. These are, the consequence of it was really clear, I mean 147 people were killed. But when it came, for me it was a recognition that, that forecast eight days ago was right, that an eight-day forecast is not stuff of science fiction, but had just happened in the most consequential way.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the real difference here between the idea of knowing a thing that’s coming in the way that knowing a cold front is coming or knowing that a tornado is coming is that Hurricane Sandy didn’t exist eight days before. It was just particles in the atmosphere moving around. And it was a mathematical model that predicted that it would form into this thing that would affect people so dramatically.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nI mean, the experience of Sandy made me want to know not only what the weather models were, but where they came from, sort of who built them, how they had evolved over time. I recognize them as this kind of complex global infrastructure, but as is often the case with complex global infrastructures, their authorship was really vague and longstanding.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And so you’ve spent a lot of time thinking about physical infrastructure and there’s something about the weather forecast then it kind of has this vibe of it’s about mathematical models and in physics and stuff in the air, but it still really is rooted in infrastructure. It kind of dovetailed with the thing that you already care about. So what does the modern weather machine actually physically look like?', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWell, to kind of see it like that, you kind of have to have this hallucination about of a sort of planetary scale. It’s made up of so many kind of tens of thousands of tiny, tiny little pieces. I always like when you’re flying out of LaGuardia Airport in New York, if you’re lucky, you kind of pass by the weather station there by the runway and it looks like a kind of jumble of equipment and that’s one piece of the weather machine. When we see satellite pictures, the kind of familiar weather satellites, that’s kind of another piece of the weather machine. And then that’s repeated, tens of thousands of times all over the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So as you started looking at the history of the weather forecast and how it started, you found that it was actually a revolution in telecommunications that made the first weather forecast possible. So tell me why the development of the telegraph was important for understanding the weather.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nIt’s really about having this picture of the earth across space. We have maps, that’s the kind of one way of imagining the earth. But until you can communicate instantaneously across distance, basically until you have the telegraph and then all of the communications technology that comes after it, you can’t really know what’s happening simultaneously in many places all at once.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd it turns out the kind of first step towards knowing what the weather is going to be in one place at many times is knowing what the weather is at one time in many places. That’s the kind of key to it. And so you end up as soon as the telegraph is invented and as soon as there’s a kind of rudimentary telegraph network, the telegraph operators begin sending messages to each other about the weather conditions and they quickly realized that especially in the U.S., the weather is often moving from West to East and they can give some advance notice of what’s going to happen that afternoon based on if you’re in New York, what it’s doing in Ohio. And that kind of basic sense that you could move faster than the clouds, that the news could move faster than the clouds, begins to open up this idea of a kind of holistic view of the planet. Suddenly you can kind of imagine yourself looking down not just on a map as a political idea, but really live, seeing how the weather is changing over space.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so in the 1840s, the Smithsonian Institute takes this sort of grand theoretical idea and turns it into an actual map, which is a kind of beautiful, quirky analog, fun thing that I loved your description of. Could you describe the map and how it functioned?', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nYeah, as with any corporate or government headquarters, when they built their new building, the centerpiece in the lobby of the Smithsonian Institution on the Mall in Washington was a big map of the fledgling United States up on the wall, pre-Civil War 1840s. And whenever they got a report in from their Smithsonian observers, they’re kind of brand new network of weather observers, they would put a little paper disc up at the disc, would have the temperature, it would have a different color for the weather. So white for fair weather, black for rain, brown for clouds, blue for snow. And so when you arrived at the Smithsonian, you could look up at the wall and you could see what the weather was across the country and you could begin to have that first inference of the weather of the future, the forecast based on how those patterns might be changing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So then we get to the 1870s when there’s an international coalition forming to expand the weather forecast. And people are starting to think about how to collect and share weather data more widely.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nI mean from the beginnings of essentially international networks of any kind – in the 1870s, you have international telegraph networks, the postal union is formed, you have the meteor convention – there’s this really this kind of vogue for standardization. And a big part of that is the recognition that if you have brand new national weather services, they need a common language for communicating their observations with each other. And we’re each going to maybe make our own forecasts, but certainly knowing what the sky is in your country is useful to my country. And that kind of basic sense of meteorology is a common good of the Earth’s atmosphere as continuous. It really becomes part of meteorological culture from the beginning. They are very good from a very early stage at cooperating with each other.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so it becomes as much of a diplomatic project as a scientific one.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nYeah, yeah. Absolutely.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo how do people go from gathering data about the weather to actually doing something about it? Where do they actually start to look into the future of what was to come?', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWell, the first person who kind of codified the process that has become the weather models as we know them today was a Norwegian meteorologist named Vilhelm Bjerknes. And it was in the 1890s that he first began to play around with the idea that you could treat the weather forecast as a hypothesis, as a kind of mathematical hypothesis, that if you could calculate the weather, if you could calculate the evolution of the atmosphere (its temperature, its pressure, its wind direction) and you could do that mathematically, then you could be quite sure the next day if you were right or wrong. And if you were wrong, you could begin to refine your equations and then do it again the next day. Or you could even go back and use the previous days observations and calculate it again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. But the mathematical models, how complex are they and how far in the future can he really look at this point?', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWell, his basic equations, which are now kind of known in meteorology, is the ‘primitive equations,’ which I kind of love. His basic equations were right, but he couldn’t solve them. He neither had enough observations, especially at different levels of altitude and high up into the atmosphere, nor could he solve the differential equations required to sort of solve his own equations. He couldn’t actually plug the numbers in. So theoretically he was mostly right. And in fact, the primitive equations are still at the root of the weather models. They’re deep in there. They have evolved dramatically, but they’re still there. They’re still relevant. But practically he got nowhere. He neither had enough to put into his math nor was he able to actually calculate what came out.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So then people began to imagine these ways to get around this issue of the computation. So a mathematician named Louis Fry Richardson had this crazy idea that I want you to tell us about.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nYeah, so Bjerknes writes his paper in 1904. He says that we can predict the weather using math and physics. And about 10 years later Lewis Fry Richardson, an English mathematician, comes to it and says, well I think I might actually give this a try. And he actually uses a set of observations that Bjerknes himself would organize the collection of from a single day above Europe. And he begins this sort of furious six-week process of actually calculating that into a weather forecast. And he does it while he’s working as an ambulance driver on the Western Front during World War One.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nHe was a Quaker so he wouldn’t fight, but he drove an ambulance. And so he talks about going back to his billet and sort of running the calculations with his slide rule and spending six weeks on this sort of single afternoon’s forecast, which famously and spectacularly was wrong, sort of famous errors in meteorology. But he was convinced that if he had better observations and if he had a greater ability to actually make these calculations, you could have a useful forecast.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd he comes to the idea that what it would really take would be 64,000 computers, which is to say, 64,000 humans (human computers) arranged in a stadium and there would be a conductor in the middle who would shine a light on them if they were going too fast or too slow and they would write their calculations and then pass it to the person next to them. And with 64,000 people, you could go fast enough to have a useful weather forecast, which is to say a forecast that is completed before the weather actually arrives.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn one day.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nI mean that’s the thing, you can have a very detailed forecast, but it’s useless if the future comes before your calculations. He also somewhat amazingly predicts like the Google campus. He thinks that like his 64,000 computers should have like ball fields and cafeterias and entertainments and things like that. And he also predicts the kind of steampunk aesthetic as well. He describes these offices with like, levers and desks and things that rise up on to roof decks. And basically what Facebook is in Menlo Park today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so funny. So we have these people thinking in these big ways about the weather and how to forecast it and we have these couple of limitations that they’re budding up against. One is computational limitation. The other one is kind of data limitation, like access to measuring these points. So how is weather forecasting moving forward in the rest of the world and what were they doing to come up with what was going to happen in the future.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWhen Richardson and Bjerknes, when their project essentially fails, there’s this kind of amazing and pretty successful basically 40-year history of meteorology that actually makes a lot of progress where the weather forecast gets better and useful and helps with early aviation. Most famously, the forecast for D-day was a solid two-day forecast that allowed the allies to postpone their invasion. It’s sort of always pointed out as this kind of forecast that changed the course of history, but none of it had anything to do with these calculations.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s sort of the equivalent of like looking at a cloud or a cold front and just seeing it go across the country and it has not a lot of math in it but as a lot of just like history and past precedent and stuff that lets you predict what’s going to happen in the future.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. And it wasn’t until the post-war era when you have the beginnings of space flight and the beginnings of real computing that the idea of actually functionally creating a weather forecast based on mathematical analysis of the atmosphere becomes possible again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo after the war we sort of get into the ’50s and ’60s and there’s a big breakthrough. So new technologies emerge and there’s the political will to build this whole earth map and make it really, really good. So tell us what happens in the ’60s that makes Bjerknes’s dream of calculating the weather finally come true.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nThe most important thing is you have this kind of love affair with the earth, with the earth as a planet. You suddenly have this collective societal vision of what the earth will look like from space. You have all this science fiction, you have the first people orbiting the earth and everyone’s sort of imagining what it is like to look back. And as soon as you kind of have that in the popular imagination, the idea of a map of the complete atmosphere becomes real.', 'John F. Kennedy :', '\\n“We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.”', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nThere’s this incredible moment in 1961 right after the Soviets first launch Sputnik, where Kennedy gives a speech where he says, we must put a man on the moon before the decade is out.', 'John F. Kennedy :', '\\n“… provide funds which are needed to meet the following national goals. First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.”', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd that’s point number one. And it turns out point number three is $75 million for weather satellites.', 'John F. Kennedy :', '\\n“… will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation. Let it be clear…”', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAs familiar as that man in the moon line is, the line about weather satellites comes like 30 seconds later. And for Kennedy, the global view of this was kind of part of the larger project of the triumph of American ideals around the globe otherwise. So you have this sort of moment where all of the kind of Imperial ideas of kind of American view of the globe and an American dominance of the globe become wrapped up in a view of the atmosphere for scientific good, for meteorological good, for this sort of what we now think of as this banal project of creating better weather forecasts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo JFK’s vision came true in many ways. Throughout the ’60s and ’70s, a lot of satellites went up into space both for military surveillance and for weather forecasting. And as the weather machine grew, a worldwide alliance developed between nations. They figured out how to share data and how to maintain the infrastructure that they’d collectively built. The main part of the UN that now deals with weather is called the World Meteorological Organization. And they get together every four years to talk about policy. And Andrew went to one of these gatherings.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nIn 2015 in Geneva, the World Meteorological Congress is the big event every four years and it’s the world’s weather diplomats coming together and sort of methodically kind of hashing through their issues and then breaking for receptions, which is the diplomatic word for ‘party’ as it turns out. It’s mostly very specific and technical. But the dynamic between the countries that essentially run supercomputers and the countries that don’t was increasingly apparent. And not surprisingly, the effects of climate change are sort of more pronounced for less wealthy countries, which are also the countries that don’t fly weather satellites and run weather supercomputers. So there was really a sense that they were all in it together, that this was a kind of thing that governments did. And there was a 150-year tradition of governments around the world sharing their data with each other, sharing their forecast with each other. And especially now when storms are more powerful, when the effects of those storms are more pronounced, when there is the sort of growing threat of what will happen with the weather in the future, it was very clear that that cooperation was needed now more than ever.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s this whole notion the weather machines is this global project that’s carried out by governments, that’s done for the public good, but increasingly private companies are getting into the weather forecasting business. So tell us about that and how this is interacting with the sort of global project that’s been going on for decades and decades.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWell, there has been the assumption, essentially since the birth of satellites and computers, that supercomputers and satellites are things that governments do. They’re too expensive for private companies to do. If you have a weather service and you need a $30 million computer, that’s going to be something that a government buys and it’s going to be in service not only to its citizens but to the entire world. But a couple of current are colliding. I mean one you have the sort of rise of private space flight. You have the kind of Space X’s of the world and you have private space observation companies. You have more severe weather and more money at stake to predict that weather and you have a rise in the recognition of big data and what we can do with data and how important it is to sort of understand the world using big data. And so you end up now with the idea that private weather forecasting is probably a pretty good business. And so after 150-year tradition of weather forecasting being something that governments do for their citizens, there’s now a bit of a gold rush where companies can run their own weather models, can fly their own weather satellites, can collect their own weather observations and provide a private forecast that is a value that exceeds the usefulness of the publicly available forecasts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd how do you think about that as someone who’s seen the long view of the weather machine, it turning towards privatization? What do you think are the complications like now and maybe the complications in the future?', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWell, I mean the first thing that I saw was the real angst among the sort of ‘dyed in the wool’ government meteorologists over what this meant for the long tradition of government weather services protecting life and property, and that being something that governments do for their citizens. But, of course, from a technical standpoint, you have the possibility of even better weather forecasts. And so there’s certainly a kind of technological thrill with the idea that this could be improved, but it’s not hard to recognize the kind of global inequality suddenly appearing in the technology of the weather forecast itself. And this real exacerbation of the effects of climate change, when you have hurricane forecasts accessible to the rich before they are accessible to the poor, and when of course they will affect the most vulnerable more directly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe get to the sort of the crux of this, which is at this moment, being aware of the new extremes when it comes to our climate is more important than ever. We’re at this moment where privatization and preparatory data and models could break that apart.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd it wouldn’t take much is the sort of strange thing. All the weather observations that are collected by the U.S. Government are put kind of right in the global bucket. And in exchange, we get all the world’s weather observations back. And if, for example, the National Weather Service decides to buy private satellite observations for one category and that company says, ‘no, you can’t share that,’ and that spigot is it is turned off, the possibility that other – start with European countries – will say, ‘well if you’re not giving us that data, we’re not giving you our data.’ And within two or three days, the entire system falls apart. And it’s not as if, we only need observations over the United States for forecasts over the United States. As soon as you’re past three or four days, you need that entire global view. And all of the weather models are kind of built on that holistic global view. And so the idea that this is within our borders, that this is a kind of local issue, that it isn’t entirely international interdependent, is preposterous. And, of course, it’s deep in the kind of global order that the U.S. built up in the second half of the 20th century. It is the kind of American ideal of leading the world with technology and cooperation. And at the moment, and not only in the Trump era but really over the last 10 years, particularly with the kind of new technological dominance of the U.S., with the Googles and Facebooks of the world, that the idea of this sort of proprietariness of this data as something that is deep in the heart of our system becomes more consequential in the way that we put together weather forecasts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think one of the things that’s fascinating about all this and all the work that you’ve done and my thinking on it that has evolved since reading your book, is this weird mixing of the idea of weather and knowing the weather being so kind of the now and every day and how much it’s about little tiny decisions about whether you bring an umbrella and also about hurricanes. It kind of gets your mind reeling in this very strange way about the human desire to know what’s coming.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nYeah. This book took me several years to write. And in the course of writing it, my older child, my daughter, went from kind of a toddler to like a proper elementary school student. And at the beginning, I would be working on this and she would say, what’s it going to be tomorrow? Like that would be kind of her last words before going to sleep. She meant like what are we doing. But I would be like, oh, how do you consider the future? What does it mean that the sky is coming this way and I’m sort of rooted in place in time and how is this going on? And so I kind of heard it as like what’s the weather going to be tomorrow? And that sort of contrast between, my watch is going to tell me what the weather’s going to be tomorrow and that’s just super easy and no worries. And then the existential dread of what’s it going to be tomorrow was right there with it. It’s the most banal thing. It is the ultimate small talk.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nAnd yet it’s also, of course, the core of our existential planetary dread, and this is in some ways the sort of parable of climate change as well. We can be pretty sure about what’s going to happen and the ability to change it or to do something about it is completely independent of that foresight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn other words, we have the information. We can effectively see into the future. But what we do with that information and how it is used for planning and preparation is up to us. To find out more about Andrew Blum’s book, ‘The Weather Machine,’ go to 99pi.org. We’re going to visit a tiny island in the North Atlantic that’s a tiny cog and the gigantic weather machine, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the most fascinating things about the entire system used to protect the weather is how reliant it is on space-age satellites orbiting the earth, and hundreds of more humble weather stations located on the land. Both technologies are needed to inform our global view because the weather machine is so vast and made of so many parts, no one thing exemplifies at all, but I asked Andrew Blum if he could zoom in on one of his favorite places that’s essential to the whole data gathering apparatus.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nWhen you try to kind of peel open the weather machine and see what it’s made of, you end up with this kind of challenge of choosing a single place to represent all the places, which of course is kind of impossible. You know, it is the nature of places that they are all different. They all occupy a kind of different spot on the map, partly because of Bjerknes and partly because of this Norwegian meteorological tradition. I latched on to Norway’s system of weather observation, and in fact, I fell completely in love with this island called Jan Mayen that’s this Arctic Island way off, you know, kind of towards Greenland that only has a weather station on it with like an army crew. They get serviced a few times a year and like a couple of Huskies, and it sounds like this really kind of incredible wild place, which needless to say, you can’t go there. Like if you go, you have to like go for three months.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nSo I kind of abandoned that dream of actually visiting this weather station, but found instead a place called Utsira which is a sort of small Island off the coast of Norway. And when I say off the coast of Norway, I mean, it’s like a 25-minute ferry ride, like, you know, no big deal. It runs a few times a day, but because of its location in the North Sea, it has been an important weather observation point, basically for 150 years. And so you have a very early telegraph line there and you have a single spot kind of up on the top of the hill in the center of the island that consistently has been the point where the Norwegian weather service has observed the weather.', '\\nIt’s a very windy place. Utsira is known for its birding and for its winds. And when you’re there, you realize, I realized what it meant for the kind of wind to be rushing by this single point. And I realized that that’s kind of what wind is. You know, wind is the passage of the atmosphere past a single spot. And you know, that has to then be tied back into the kind of global computational system. You know, you need to sort of send word back to Oslo and Oslo needs to send word back to Frankfurt where the sort of European collector is, and then that gets sent to Virginia. And the entire thing kind of gets networked together into typing in, you know, “Utsira” on Google, and then the temperature shows up. But all of those things have to fit together, and that system has to be deliberately designed and the kind of design of that system goes back to the middle of the 19th century with a sort of first recognition that not only was it useful to know what the weather was and other places, but it was suddenly technologically possible to get that news pretty speedily.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And it’s gathered by a human or tended to by humans.', 'Andrew Blum:', '\\nIt’s tended to by a human. Yeah. He runs the restaurant and he does the weather observations, so it’s four times a day. He goes on his back stoop and he has a cigarette and he kind of looks at the sky and then he goes to his computer and he logs in and he, in the kind of Norwegian weather services dropdown menus, he sort of does a qualitative analysis of what the clouds are according to the sort of rules that he’s been taught. And that gets them sort of put in the whole way. And the same thing happens in every airport in the country. Every major airport has a round-the-clock weather observer. Some person who’s like in an office somewhere on the grounds of the airport who, you know, once an hour is checking the observations that the automated system has made to make sure the system’s working and if the clouds are slightly different than the ceilometer the cloud observing machine can read, to correct those.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAndrew Blum is the author of “The Weather Machine,” a journey inside the forecast.', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Delaney Hall, mix and tech production by Sharif Youssef, music by Sean Real.

I was going to go to work and I’ve only been awake for like half an hour or something, so I was still a bit woozy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPeter lives in Dresden, Germany, where he works in elder care visiting clients at their homes and to do that, he usually takes the bus, but that morning he noticed something unusual as he boarded.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nWhen I got on the bus, I see that the bus driver had put up a sign inside of the bus that said in German ‘Diesen Bus Steuert ein Deutscher Fahrer,’ which means: ‘This bus is driven by a German driver.’', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nA homemade sign saying ‘this bus is driven by a German driver,’ was not the kind of thing Peter was used to seeing on his daily commute.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s reporter Kevin Caners.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBut to Peter, the driver’s message was pretty clear.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nI can only interpret that the person who put up the sign would have said.

You can talk to me in German because I am one of the good ones and not a foreigner.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut what really drove the message of this sign home was not just the words but the typeface they were printed in.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nA typeface from a larger family of typefaces once used throughout Germany and commonly referred to as Fraktur.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn which in English goes by a different name, blackletter.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBlackletter is the type of old-timey Gothic typeface that you often see used for the bold front titles of newspapers like the ‘New York Times’ or ‘Washington Post.’ You might also see it on tattoos or the T-shirts of heavy metal bands. Put it on a page and it brings to mind the time of castles, knights and feather quills.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut for many people, especially in Europe, blackletter is most closely associated with one thing. It’s the Nazi font.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nI’m not that good with history and stuff, but what I know is that the font that was used by Nazi Germany, really, really, looks the same way as this.', 'Archival Tape:', '\\n“October of 1938, Adolf Hitler made his triumphant entrance into Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland. Just days earlier, the world was at the brink of war and in France and Great Britain reluctantly signed on to the Munich Pact.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you’ve ever caught even one minute of the ‘History Channel’ or really any documentary about World War II, you have seen this typeface on Nazi posters, on Nazi office buildings, on Nazi roadwork signs, usually saying something like ‘Verboten’ with a big exclamation mark.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nToday in Germany, blackletter typefaces are frequently used by Neo-Nazi groups and for many Germans, they bring to mind the dark times of the country’s fascist past.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich is why it was pretty clear to Peter and the other passengers on the bus what was going on with this bus driver’s sign.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nThe message by itself is not welcoming and has this nationalist tone, but the font choice adds to that.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nFlorian Hardwig is a graphic designer in Berlin and the editor of a website called, ‘Fonts in Us.’ He says that in Germany when it’s not being used on a band tee or masthead, blackletter has a very specific set of connotations.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nThe blackletter typefaces as a genre have been associated with German nationalism for a long time and everybody who sees them today knows that it’s not a standard choice. It sends a signal emphasizing the ‘Germanness.’', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nEven if it was in a neutral font, it would still have been a problematic thing, but it’s kind of like the cherry on top. The one thing that really drives the point home.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe sign that Peter saw that day would end up causing a big stir in Germany and get folded into an ongoing debate surrounding racism, nationalism, and culture. A debate in which the use of blackletter often serves as a kind of symbolic dividing line.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nToday, depending on one’s perspective, blackletter can either represent German culture’s rich and proud heritage or alternatively symbolize everything that’s wrong with it. But to understand how people’s feelings about a simple typeface got to this point, we need to go back to the moment of its birth.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause once upon a time in that bygone era of knights and castles and feather quills, blackletter wasn’t limited to Germany. It wasn’t even Germanic. Instead, it was used all across Europe.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBlackletter may seem incredibly ornate like it was created for the sole purpose of turning letterforms into little individual flourishes of art. It definitely does not seem like a common means of communication.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut back in the Middle Ages, blackletter with its angular forms was actually considered practical, especially for monastic scribes copying out entire books by hand.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nBlackletter initially developed in the Middle Ages because forms that had these kinds of angles were easier to write more rhythmically and correctly then rounded forms.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nDan Reynolds is an American type designer and historian who has been living in Germany for the last two decades and he says that today we’re used to typefaces with perfectly rounded curves. Think of our O’s, U’s, P’s and C’s. But while these shapes look easy enough to draw, if you’re using a quill to draw out thousands of them, page after page, they’re not.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then just as now, readers valued standardization in the text. Every letter, even the rounded ones had to look exactly the same, but it was hard for a monk copying out a long text to draw consistently perfect circles.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nSo blackletter writing styles probably arose so that the products would be more even in their appearance and probably also faster to produce.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you were a scribe, it was a lot easier to produce all those O’s and U’s and C’s out of a series of short straight lines.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nThe technique of using straight lines instead of perfectly rounded curves gave the letters a fragmented appearance, which is actually how Germany’s most common form of blackletter type would get its name, Fraktur.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nThat’s the Latin term for ‘broken’ because the letterforms have these broken angle curves.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBlackletter was first developed in France in the 12th century, but within a few hundred years it had become standard throughout Europe. It wasn’t even really a stylistic choice. It was just what words looked like and went unquestioned.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nThat was what people thought of when they thought of writing, when they thought of text.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nSusan Reed is head of Germanic studies at the British Library and she says that blackletter became so ingrained in the culture that even after it stopped being needed, people kept using it.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nAnd so when the printing press was introduced, most of the early typefaces were some variety of blackletter typeface.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs with so many big leaps in technology, the printing press started off by borrowing heavily on the design conventions that came before it, even though the new operating principles made those conventions unnecessary.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nEven Gutenberg, the man who developed the first popular printing presses was no exception. He went for a Textura, a narrow, very angular blackletter typeface that was also used by scribes at that time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt first, the printing press appeared to only further cement blackletter status as Europe’s dominant form of writing, but soon it would be challenged by a very different kind of typeface, Roman. Kind of rolls off the tongue.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd trust me, you’ve definitely seen Roman type before too.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nIt’s the style of letter that’s associated with Imperial Rome.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut just like the letters chiseled onto the side of an ancient marble column, Roman letters are sparer and more vertical than their blackletter counterparts. You’d also probably find them a lot easier to read and there’s a reason for that.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nThe letters are instantly recognizable as they look like the letters that we’ve been reading our entire lives.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nToday, almost all major Western typefaces are Roman, from Times New Roman to Arial. Every time you open up Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you’re using Roman type. It’s our era’s blackletter. It’s just what writing looks like.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nYes. I mean it’s a strange thing. People sort of ask, why Fraktur became the default typeface in Germany and I always almost want to flip the question on its head and say, why did Roman become the default everywhere else when most printing started in blackletter type?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRoman script might have stayed lost to history, but right around the same time, Gutenberg was printing blackletter bibles in Germany, something else was happening in Italy. Renaissance scholars were rediscovering ancient Roman texts.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nYou had this rediscovery and the renaissance of classical literature and the classical world and classical letterforms were being brought back.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nCommitted to bringing back the culture and wisdom of antiquity, Italian scholars began consciously developing their own Roman-style letters, which drew heavily on the classical forms they encountered.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nAnd so when they started printing classical texts, then they started using those as well.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAt first, Roman type was used strictly for texts written in Latin, the language of antiquity and the church, but pretty quickly and for reasons that remain a little hazy, Roman type broke out of its Latin cage and kind of took over.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy the end of the 16th century, Roman type had become common in the written vernacular languages of France and Spain. England followed suit in the 17th century. The Netherlands and Sweden in the 18th.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIt had become the very same thing that blackletter had been before, ubiquitous and unquestioned.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even as Roman became the Western world’s dominant form of writing, Germany and the German language stayed resolutely committed to blackletter. An island of broken script in a sea of curves.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd it’s mostly thanks to the bestselling author and the history of the German language, Martin Luther.', 'Monty Python Clip:', '\\n“The adventures of Martin Luther.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nLuther and the Protestant reformation he set in motion in Germany threw everything that had to do with Rome and the Catholic church into doubt.', 'Archival Tape:', '\\n“The partisan reformer whose reassessment of the role of individual in Christian belief shook the foundations of a post-feud Germany in the grip of the 16th century.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd in the process, he gave German as a written language, a big boost.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nLuther, by writing so much and trying to write to as broad as possible audience, really codified a lot of what written German was.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nLuther and other German Protestants were especially keen to distinguish German writing from the writing of Catholic Italy, which they saw as corrupt, even evil, and that included the church’s favorite typeface.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nSo there was an explicit casting of Roman type as being associated with the Pope and with Catholicism and things that were not German. And this was at least by the time Luther is getting to his bible editions, this is an explicit wish that they be set in German type and not in Roman type.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut there was one German typeface in particular which would end up being used more than any other, Fraktur.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nFraktur came to be seen as uniquely German, almost as if it were imbued with special dramatic values. So much so that people would eventually refer to all of German blackletter typefaces as Fraktur.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis association of Fraktur with all things good and Roman with all things bad became so strong that in some of Luther’s German Bible editions, unpleasant words like wrath and devil and punishment were set in a Roman typeface to distinguish it from the rest of the text, which stayed in Fraktur.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nLater, German texts would go even further, applying the rule if even part of a word was borrowed from another language.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nAnd you actually get these other wonderful things where there’s a foreign loan word, as say a Latin stem and German suffix, the Latin stem within the same word will be printed in Roman letters and then the ending in Fraktur.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nSo this is a clear break typographically on the page from Rome and just as there wasn’t going to be a reconciliation between Germany and Italy, there wasn’t going to be a typographic reconciliation either.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt first, blackletter remained popular in many parts of Protestant Europe, but one by one, the other Protestant countries began to give in to the temptations of Roman type until finally, Germany was the lone holdout.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIn part because, unlike the people in those other Protestant countries, Germany remained a fragmented jumble of smaller states until the late 1800s. So Fraktur came to be seen as one of the things holding German national identity together, especially in the 19th century when the country was invaded by Napoleon.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe occupying French had their Roman letters and the Germans had Fraktur.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nGermany as a nation without nationhood as a collection of small, quite fragmented states, needed these other symbols of national identity, and I think this is when Fraktur particularly becomes associated with Germany and the German language and German culture.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nMany came to believe that where there was no Fraktur, there was no Germany, including the mother of Germany’s greatest writer.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nGoethe’s mother, she actually described Roman letters as fatal, as if they’re almost sort of painful for her to read. I think that’s something that’s often quoted as evidence of this naturalness of Fraktur if Germany’s greatest writer’s mother approved of it.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIn 1871, when Germany finally unified, Fraktur became the official government typeface and Otto Von Bismarck, the first chancellor was such a staunch supporter that he said he would refuse to read any German book not set in German type.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut right around the time they finally got their own country, a growing contingent of Germans began to wonder if they really needed their own typeface.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nLiberal, cosmopolitan and future-facing, these Germans came to feel it was silly to keep using letterforms from the Middle Ages. They began pressing for Germany to drop its beloved Fraktur and move to Roman type.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nThere were people sort of in the spirit of progress and modernism who thought that this is crazy, we should be a more international country where we’re connected with our neighbors, we have business ties and cultural ties.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIncreasingly academic and scientific papers intended for foreign distribution were being printed in Roman type and as the world became more international, Roman type also started seeping in. It began to be taught in schools alongside Fraktur, and by 1891 about 40% of German books were being printed in Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut more conservative Germans pushed back. They insisted that blackletter was and should remain a cultural staple.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIn 1911, the German Reichstag actually held a vote on whether the country should switch over by having Roman replace Fraktur as the official typeface in German schools and government offices. But after a fierce debate, the legislation didn’t pass. German topography had reached a stalemate with neither side willing to budge.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEven by the end of the 1920s, in the era of telephones, radios, refrigerators, and jazz, traditional Fraktur street signs could be seen hanging next to art deco posters featuring sans serif Roman fonts.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nIt was a dual thing. If you look at photographs from the cityscape in the 1880s or 1890s, you would see both letterforms and maybe even more on Roman type because that was the style associated with commerce and advertising.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIt was as though there were two separate typographical realities representing two different Germanies.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFraktur would end up losing the struggle for Germany’s soul, but it wasn’t the liberal freedom-loving over-educated cosmopolitans who finally broke the impasse. Instead, it was the most ardent German nationalist of all time.', 'Archival Tape:', '\\n“The responsibility lies on the shoulders of one man, by his latest act of naked aggression, Hitler has committed a crime against the whole human race.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIn 1933, the Nazi party rose to power on a wave of German chauvinism.

All have been rebuffed by the leader of the German Nazis in his senseless criminal greed for power.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nFraktur was in, Roman was out.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nThere was a lot of push from certain areas within the government and within the party to use the moment in 1933 to ram this change through, to get rid of Roman type and really make everything be blackletter.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nDirectives were given in the interior ministry that said, from now on, they would use blackletter typewriters for everything. Many publishers changed over and the proportion of books and newspapers printed in Fraktur type grew substantially.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nAnd you see placards that tell Germans to be German, to think German, to even be German in their writing. And of course, these are in Fraktur.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere was just one problem. Adolf Hitler kind of hated Fraktur.', 'Adolf Hitler Speech:', '\\n[speaking in German]', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nSo in 1934, he actually made a speech in which he criticized the obsession with outward trappings of Germanness among which he included Gothic writing.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nThis gothic romanticism, Hitler says, is ill-suited to our age of iron glass and steel.', 'Adolf Hitler Speech (continued):', '\\n[speaking in German]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt wasn’t that Hitler wasn’t into traditional German values. He just didn’t think that should mean being old-fashioned.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nIt’s hard to have everyone living in the mountains, on farms with their cows and their sheep and their goats and also working in factories to build high-tech airplanes and rockets.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nAnd when the Olympics came to Berlin in 1936, he insisted that a lot of the publicity and the posters for that show it should be in Roman rather than Fraktur type. Because you were bringing the world to see the new Germany.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBesides, Hitler thought his fascist values shouldn’t just apply to Germans. The Third Reich was supposed to span the globe.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nHitler actually said that German was becoming the world language and within a hundred years everybody would be speaking German.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even Hitler’s delusions of grandeur had their limits. He knew that if he wanted to rule over the world, he would have to use a typeface the rest of the world could actually read.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd so in 1941, an edict was circulated to all publishers and printers on behalf of the furor himself decreeing that Roman type become the standard type throughout Germany.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEffective immediately. Neither Fraktur nor its cursive counterparts were to be taught in schools, used in government documents or appear on street signs. All magazines and newspapers were likewise expected to change over to the Roman script.', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nWhich was quite an extraordinary thing to do in the middle of a world war. It’s very expensive to just suddenly go over from one typeface to another universally.', 'Dan Reynolds:', '\\nAnd the explanation in a letter is that – shock, horror – they had found out that blackletter was actually a Jewish invention and that it had to be dropped immediately. This wasn’t true, but it was an unassailable argument. It was impossible to come back from that.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nFraktur didn’t finish everywhere overnight, but with the edict, it quickly fell out of use and it would never fully recover.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Nazis brought an end to blackletter’s 800 year run as a common form of writing. So it’s ironic that the typeface Hitler banned and personally disliked remained stubbornly associated with them.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nPerhaps it’s because the Nazis promoted Fraktur so heavily before changing course, but it’s also just because they were German nationalists and it was a traditional German typeface. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that they’ve found it hard to shake the connection.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEspecially telling was the edict itself. The one banning Fraktur. Although the memorandum was typed in Roman font, the Nazi letterhead at the top was printed in blackletter.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nBy 1945 when Germany was finally defeated, no one wanted anything to do with the “Nazi font.”', 'Susan Reed:', '\\nAnd by the 1950s it had pretty much died out. I think I saw some statistics that between 1951 and 1979 there was something like 34 books published in Fraktur in that whole period, so that’s quite astonishing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhether or not it’s okay to use blackletter today is a complicated question, especially in Germany. It depends on the context and it doesn’t always make sense.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nYeah. Fraktur on a restaurant sign or on a beer label is invisible and you can Fraktur mastheads on newspapers like ‘New York Times’ because that’s normal. That’s what we’re used to.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nConsumer items and commercial ventures that want to evoke a more innocent sense of tradition and quality often use blackletter without any trouble. The same goes for heavy metal bands and other people that want to play up its medieval or gothic qualities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut there are also contexts where its use is not innocent and can’t be forgiven has naive.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nWhen Peter Dörfell, the bus rider in Dresden, saw that sign, the one that said, “This bus is driven by a German driver.” It was printed in blackletter and Peter knew exactly what it was meant to communicate.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nLike if I were the person that was potentially targeted by potential Nazis, I would definitely take the next bus.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nIn fact, the sight of the sign and of the font was so alarming that there was no way he could just let it go.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nSo I was thinking to myself, what should I do? Should I talk to the guy? I didn’t know what to do, but then I thought, wait, this is an official public bus. I don’t think that’s even legal.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nWhen Peter got off the bus, he took a picture of the homemade sign on his phone and tweeted it at the Dresden Public Transit Authority asking essentially ‘what the hell is this?’', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nAnd they responded like really quickly, a half an hour later. And they were like, “Yeah, somebody already told us that. We don’t know how that could happen. We already took the sign down and the bus driver will not be driving today anymore.” So I was like, “All right, thanks for the quick answer. Good thing.” And I thought that was it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut a little later, a journalist messaged Peter on Twitter.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nAnd it’s like, “Hey, I’m with the press. Do you want to do an interview?” I’m kind of like, “Okay, sure.” And from there on it just kind of spiraled.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nThe story appeared on the local news. Then on the national news when the driver was let go, some German nationalists wrote tweets in the driver’s defense.', 'Peter Dörfell:', '\\nThen some right-wing politicians retweeted it. Then I got some hate mail. Ugh…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn the end, it took a couple of weeks for everything to die down. Although that doesn’t mean the larger issues swirling around Fraktur are anywhere near resolved.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAlt-right nationalism remains on the rise in Germany and especially since the refugee crisis, controversies surrounding the use of the typeface seem to be happening with more frequency. No mainstream conservative politician publicly uses Fraktur, but in 2017 a police anti-terror unit in the state of Saxony was sanctioned for using a logo on the interior of one of their specialized vehicles that featured a blackletter font.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMostly though the only people openly using Fraktur are Neo-Nazi groups promoting their hyper-traditional version of German nationalism. Apparently most of them still don’t realize that Hitler considered their favorite typeface hopelessly tacky and provincial.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd many nationalists don’t even understand which typeface it is they’re using. The Dresden bus driver, for example, may have thought his sign was in Fraktur. It was actually in Old English, a blackletter typeface that has no historical connection to Germany.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course, if Peter’s story about the bus driver and his blackletter sign demonstrates anything, it’s that no matter what the real historical facts are, Fraktur will never return to the mainstream. For better or worse, it’s going to keep on being the Nazi font.', 'Florian Hardwig:', '\\nThis long tradition of centuries of use is kind of forgotten and all we can see now are these 12 years of Nazis and yeah, you can’t change that. It has happened and that’s the way it is and it won’t come back.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even if they don’t think it should return to everyday use, those who study Fraktur don’t want to see it completely forgotten either.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nAnd perhaps no one more so than Hanno Blohm.', 'Hanno Blohm:', '\\n“Meinen Namen kennen Sie. Hanno Blohm Hanno Wilhelm Blohm bin ich genannt worden.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nHanno is a 76-year-old retired teacher and is the president of the Association for German Script and Language which is dedicated to preserving and improving people’s knowledge of Fraktur and other old writing styles.', 'Hanno Blohm:', '\\n“Und dass sie das so machen, zeigt nur, dass sie von der Geschichte unserer Sprache, unserer Schrift nichts wissen. Die wissen, dass nicht.”', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nHe says that the fact that Neo-Nazis used blackletter typefaces only shows that they know nothing about Germany’s history.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd much of this historical ignorance is for a deeply ironic reason. Most Germans have trouble reading older German documents precisely because they are in Fraktur.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nYou could probably read something printed in Fraktur, but even then only with a bit of effort and patience and handwritten Fraktur is much more difficult. It’s basically illegible for most people today. As a consequence, many of the books and letters and diaries of the past have become harder to connect with.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich is why one of the association’s main activities today and the one Hanno is most passionate about is teaching children how to read and write old German cursive.', 'Kevin Caners:', '\\nDuring our interview, he shows me some correspondence from the 19th century whose handwriting I can’t make heads or tails of and I say, “That looks hard.”', 'Hanno Blohm:', '\\n“Schreibschrift bis ins 19.

We have these arguments about buildings too. We’re talking about making federal buildings beautiful again after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs we were producing the story of Fraktur and its starring role in this centuries-long drama of German nationalism, a contemporary story hit the news that was also at the intersection of design and nationalism. In this case, the story was about the architecture of US federal buildings. On February 4th, 2020, ‘Architectural Record’ published a story commenting on a draft of an executive order that they got a hold of that called for the White House to adopt federal guidelines to ensure that “the classical architectural style shall be the preferred and default style,” when it came to new and upgraded federal buildings.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe order was authored by a group called the National Civic Art Society and it was titled ‘Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again,’ in case you were at all confused as to the audience that this particular order was pandering to. Our friend, the architecture critic, and celebrated McMansion skeptic Kate Wagner wrote a column in ‘The New Republic’ about it and I called her up to talk about it. The first thing I did was ask her what the authors of this order mean when they say that all federal buildings should it be in the classical architectural style.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nSo it’s kind of funny. Their idea of what classicism is basically just anything inspired by Greek and Roman architecture, but also 19th-century Victorian kitsch is fine too. Because they included the Eisenhower building, which is this ridiculous second empire building with a million columns. And I hate it so much and it’s so ugly, but they were like, “This is great architecture.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell for the record, I kind of like the Eisenhower building – it’s pretty fussy and very French – but the point is that when people extol the greatness of classical architecture, they’re basically talking about columns.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nYep. They’re basically talking about columns.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis broad advocacy for classical architecture is in opposition to more modernist or brutalist styles.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nThey believe that modernism is degenerate and it’s ruining everything and people hate it. And we need to free people from modernism because it’s not the architecture of the people or whatever, which is of course ridiculous. How many people go to see Fallingwater literally every year? I don’t know.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this proposed order is a 180-degree reversal to a seminal document written in 1962 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan called ‘Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture’ that explicitly stated, “Design must flow from the architectural profession to the government and not vice versa.”', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nYeah, so there was basically a mandate in that document that said an official architectural style must be avoided and that federal buildings and new buildings should be exemplary of the time in which they are built, the opposite in spirit to the proposed executive order.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe architecture community reacted very strongly to this proposal, and I should stress here that this is not an official proposal from the White House. It’s a draft of a proposal that one influential group hopes the White House will adopt, but people have taken it very seriously. The American Institute of Architects released this statement, “The AIA strongly opposes uniform style mandates for federal architecture. Architecture should be designed for the specific communities that it serves, reflecting our rich nations, diverse places, thought, culture and climates. Architects are committed to honoring our past as well as reflecting our future progress, protecting the freedom of thought and expression that are essential to democracy.” Beyond the codification of one federal style, the architecture community objected to one aspect of the order in particular.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nThis order would allow Trump to create a “president’s committee for the re-beautification of federal architecture,” which is such a trolley name, and which would enforce this classical design mandate. And this panel would exclude, “artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, members of the building industry or any other members of the public that are affiliated with any interest group or organization involved in architecture.” So basically anyone who works in architecture, has anything to do with architecture is not allowed to comment on architecture in this panel. So of course, everyone is mad. The AIA is mad, the preservationists are mad. Kate Wagner, the architecture critic is mad.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe objection from the architectural community, including yourself, is not an objection to classical architecture, right?', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nNo classical architecture is great. Ever since architecture has existed, there have been architectural revivals of past styles. I mean it is a debate that frames the history of architecture and the debate is commonly known as the ancients versus the moderns.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd that debate is like a healthy debate.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nIt’s a healthy debate.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s part of architecture, it’s part of culture.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nYeah, exactly. When do we look towards the past for architectural ideas, and when do we push forward through various integrations of those ideas together in a sort of eclectic mash, or furthering technological progress. I mean it’s one of the classic debates of architecture. But the thing is, is that classicism is… I mean, classical buildings are beautiful, obviously, and it’s important that architects be trained in classicism, and it’s important that a lot of architects go on to study classicism and to practice building classical buildings. Because we always need people to, for example, make additions to historical buildings, make restorations to historical buildings, to lecture on historical buildings. To work across other fields, including anthropology and archeology, to talk about how historical buildings may have been in the past. I mean it’s a really central and important part of architecture.', 'Kate Wagner:', '\\nThat being said, time always moves forward and architecture historically and today has always been a conversation between past and present. Not a dogmatic argument between past and present, though that has happened. That’s what preservation is supposed to be. It’s not supposed to be making a moth-balled museum of every building. It’s how do we reconcile historical architecture with contemporary needs, with contemporary economics, with contemporary politics. That’s what preservation does and modernism is included in that. The problem is not classical architecture. The problem is that there’s a certain type of chud online who thinks that classical architecture is proof that Western society is better than other societies. And that we had a beautiful Western society that was infallible but crumbled under globalization, or immigration, or whatever right-wing crypto-fascist element you think ruined columns.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe one and only Kate Wagner.

Now, if I were in England, or France or Ireland or Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries, I would probably not want this many windows. That’s because, back then, the more windows you had the more tax you paid. This was all variable from place to place and over time, but the principle was that a window tax was a good stand-in for a progressive income tax. The bigger the house, the more windows, the higher tax you paid. When the window tax was instituted in 1696 in England and Wales, a home was taxed at a regular flat rate and then taxed an extra amount for each window over 10 windows that it had. Like I said, the number of windows and amount of tax varied a lot over time, but the tax was pretty easy to assess by an outside observer. It was certainly considered easier to assess than an income tax and so it persisted for quite some time, in some places, into the 20th century.', 'This had a funny side effect on architecture that you can still see today in some buildings in the UK and Europe.

No one is quite sure why he gets so much credit for the flushing toilet, but I think it’s because his name was Crapper.

So when you put soap and water on your hands those little soap tails find things that aren’t water and dig their tails in to try to get away. This breaks up bacteria and virus cell membranes and surrounds any debris with soap molecules and makes them easy to rinse away when more water and friction are applied.

I’ve been to Stirling Castle in Scotland a few times and I love it there, especially “The Great Hall,” which has been painted a shocking and delightful buttery yellow since its restoration in the 90s. We did a story about it a few years ago, you should check it out. It seems impossible that a Hall like the one in Stirling Castle and the hall in your house have a shared origin but they do. The hall used to be everything. From the middle ages to about the 15th century, the hall was effectively “the house” with a central hearth that people used to warm themselves and cook over. All activity took place there, awake and asleep. As soon as a second room was added to homes, the hall has been on a downhill slide. Now it is this dumb thing– a non-room room, whose primary function is to connect other rooms. So pour one out for the hall.', 'If I turn right, I enter the living room.

There are admittedly a lot of things to hate, the criminal price of ink is a big one and paper jams are another. According to an article in “The New Yorker” called “Why Paper Jams Persist,” desktop printers will probably always have paper jams. The problem isn’t really the printer, it’s the paper. Paper is an organic substance that has different properties of thickness and texture depending on what kind of tree it came from and how it’s processed. Commercial printers, like the ones you see in the movies at newspapers, where someone gets to say “stop the presses!”, they have these long stretches where the paper goes in a straight line and gets ink put on, but a desktop printer has to do everything in a tiny box. So the paper is pulled off the tray, makes a tight turn, gets rolled onto the ink drum, where the image gets put on, then it gets heated to almost 800 degrees Fahrenheit to fuse the ink to the page. And if you’re printing double-sided paper, it stops and turns, it gets turned again, gets rolled, heated and gets spit out– it’s truly a marvel that it works at all.

Of these three common pieces of cutlery, the fork is BY FAR the most recent addition to the tableware family – by probably like thousands of years. Straight, two-prong forks were used in cooking for carving and getting things off a fire, but for a long time, they weren’t on the dinner table itself. People used spoons, knives and just, you know, their fingers instead. Forks were introduced a few times by fancy people and they were often ridiculed for it, but they only really took off when they evolved to have a little bit of curve in them and extra tines, so they could be more versatile for scooping and spearing small things on the plate. The curious thing about the evolution of the fork is how it changed the design of the knife. For millennia, table knives always had pointed ends for spearing food, but with the fork there, that function of the knife was redundant so it could be eliminated. In 1669, King Louis XIV of France decreed all pointed dinner table knives illegal, you know, to stop people from stabbing each other, which I guess was a problem then. So, new knives were to be made to have rounded tips and all existing table knives were to be rounded off to reduce their potential for violence. This style of knife spread across the world which is why the knives in your drawer, unless they’re a specialty knife, probably have blunt ends.', 'Okay, so I’m going to save some stuff in the kitchen for the next time we do this… if we need to do this, and we’re going to end up back in the living room, at the record player, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'One of the things that I love about vinyl records is you can see how they work.

And even if you’d never heard it before, you kind of feel you know the song already. It has a kind of like Jungian urtext kind of quality to it. So, who are the Baha Men?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo Baha Men are a really hardworking, multi-generational band from the Bahamas and they’ve been playing together in one form or another since the ’70s. They started off as a group called High Voltage, sort of playing resorts around the islands. They’ve always been known for this style called junkanoo. And that’s the music associated with a street parade by the same name. You can think, big bright costumes, hundreds of steel drums and cowbells and goatskin drums, just like a big party. And this is kind of the scene that Baha Men are part of.', '[Song Clip]', '\\nYou don’t have to worry', '\\nOr even say you’re sorry', '\\nWhen you hear the Junkanoo.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThey were signed by a young A&R guy, Steve Greenberg, and he stayed with them across multiple labels and break-even releases. And Steve actually ends up being the guy who convinces them to record ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’.', 'Steve Greenburg:', '\\nThe song had a really amazing hook and I’d say one of these days I’m going to figure out how to do this. Do this song right. Because there’s something here. And I just never forgot about the song. I knew that the Baha Men were the people who I wanted to record the song. They just made sense to me. And, in fact, I used to keep a diary and I wrote in my diary, “I’m going to record that song, ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ with the Baha Men, and have a big hit all over the world. I’m certain.”', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThis sounds kind of crazy in retrospect, but Baha Men were like, “No thanks.” The song was already a hit in that area and they just didn’t think it would be a good look to cover something everybody already knew.', 'Baha Men:', '\\nI didn’t want to do the song. That’s why I have to give Steve credit. “I’m not going to ask you to do anything else, just this one song.” And hey, I said, “Steve, conversation is finished. We will do the song.” I’m extremely happy that we did.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo why did their producer, Steve, care so much about the song?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nI think Steve is just one of these guys who knows a hit when he hears it. Steve has also given, for better or worse, he’s given the world acts like Hanson. And if there’s a song that’s going to play well in stadiums and on Disney, yeah, he just knows.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo you said the song was already a hit in the Bahamas. Is that where he heard it originally? Steve?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. So Steve heard the song via Keith Wainwright who’s my original kind of Wikipedia mystery guy, and Steve Greenberg instantly knew that there was something special about the hook. And that kind of led to him deciding to pitch it to Baha Men.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So Steve hears the song, likes the song… well, doesn’t really like the song but likes the hook of the song. So who wrote the hook?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nTo find that out… It’s the late ’90s, so Steve went and, as someone did in the late ’90s, asked Jeeves. He went to the website and said, “Jeeves, Who Let The Dogs Out?” And this led Steve to a message board where people were discussing their vacations and music played at Carnival. And this is where Steve first learns that this track is cut by a guy named Anslem Douglas.', 'Anslem Douglas:', '\\nI’m still amazed that after 20 years it’s still out there and playing and new kids, a new generation, is growing up on it. If you don’t know the song ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ you’re living under a rock. Think about it. What other song you know been out there for 20 years and every child knows it?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo Douglas was actually already a known name in the Bahamas music scene and he wanted to use this platform to write kind of a feminist anthem, like a song that could be this rallying cry for women who are fed up with the ‘dogs’: men behaving poorly on the dance floor. So do you want to… We can take a listen.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, to his version. Totally.', '[Clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Anslem Douglas]', '\\nWell the party was nice, the party was pumpin’ (Hey, Yippie-Yi-Yo)', '\\nAnd everybody havin’ a ball (Hah, ho, Yippie-Yi-Yo)', '\\nUntil the fellas started name callin’ (Yippie-Yi-Yo)', '\\nAnd the girls respond to the call', '\\nI heard a woman shout out', 'Who let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is the song.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThat’s it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. I mean, that seems very clear. So Anslem Douglas wrote that hook, and that’s the thing we think of when we think of this song ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’ Although I love the arrangement, actually.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah, I do too. And you know, Douglas is obviously more in the so-called calypso tradition and it’s more like a, “take off your shirt, take off your towel, whip it at a high BPM,” and the Baha Men is this Americanized hip-hop influenced. But the Baha Men version retains this junkanoo undertone, which was really important as far as crossover movements for the genre.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo when it comes to the question, who let the dogs out? The answer is Anslem Douglas.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nNot quite. Douglas wrote ‘Doggy,’ but it really wasn’t his idea alone.', 'Anslem Douglas:', '\\nI never told anyone, “Hey, I came up with the phrase.” Never did, because I didn’t. I knew that my brother-in-law was the one who said, “Hey, you’ve got to do this song. You’ve got to do the song, Who Let the Dogs…” I said, “All right, I will do it.” So he was the one who encouraged me to do it. So I gave him that credit because he was the one who said, “Do the song.”', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo Douglas’ former brother-in-law was the host of this deejay mix show ‘Wrecked Shop Radio’ out of Toronto. And two of that show’s producers were these guys, Patrick Stephenson and Leroy Williams, who they were like writing promos and jingles for it. And one of those jingles contained the phrase ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ followed by the sound of dogs barking. And this is late ’95, early ’96.', 'Wrecked Shop Radio:', '\\n“At the front of the office, I used to go, “Who let the dogs out?” And Maurice would be out there and he’d go, “woo, woo, woo.” And I’d go, “Who let the dogs out?” And you’d hear the dogs go “Woo, woo, woo, woo.” And then we brought that in and Patrick was like, put that all together. That’s how that vibration came out.”', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nIt was very hard to track these guys down. But after years of begging and calling and DMing, they eventually produced these original recordings.', '[Clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ jingle by Wrecked Shop Radio]', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So that’s the chorus right there. That’s it. Wow.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. I mean that the hook. But this part kind of gets a little fuzzy because, well one, it’s 20 years ago, but people involved have different accounts. The long-short is that Stephenson and Williams, kind of on a handshake agreement, told Douglas like, “Okay, you use this. Write a song, go down to carnival.” But they didn’t think it was going to become a big hit and they didn’t really know much about protecting publishing rights at the time.', 'Wrecked Shop Radio:', '\\n“We were so in love with doing the music and being creative, but we were passionate about creating and not taking care of the business and the business bit us in the end.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. So sort of handshake deal allowed Anslem Douglas to make this Carnival song ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ called ‘Doggy’ and then it’s the one who gets licensed to the Baha Men to make ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’ So did Stephenson and Williams know anything about the licensing to the Baha Men?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nNot until they heard it on the radio.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s rough.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. I mean for a song so happy, it’s a very dark moment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my God. Oh my God.', 'Wrecked Shop Radio:', '\\n“I’m going to a Jamaican restaurant and hearing this record that “we did and they leave the hook and I’m hearing it on the radio. Oh yeah, we wrote that. And other people are making so much money off this thing. Yeah, it was hard after you found out that someone else was making money off your idea.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo there’s no official ruling, but Douglas signs an affidavit asserting that Stephenson and Williams were the original authors of the hook that his work was based on. That gives Douglas the rights to move forward with his own version and licensing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So let me try to get this all straight. So when it comes to ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ there’s Steve and the Baha Men who made the super popular version that most people know. There’s Anslem Douglas who made the version from the Bahamas called ‘Doggy’ that was directly covered and licensed by the Baha Men. And then there’s these DJs who had this brilliant innovation of bearing a rhetorical question with the dogs barking. And so that’s incredibly complicated set of people and versions and rights and rights holders and people fighting. It’s just kind of stunning.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nWell, actually there’s more.', '[Clip of ‘You’re a Dog’ by 20 Fingers]', '\\nWho let them dogs loose? (who? who?)', '\\nWho let them dogs loose? (who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what is that?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThat is a remix of a song called ‘You’re a Dog,’ which is by a group called 20 Fingers featuring the singer Gillette. And that came out in ’94. It was a followup single to their global kind of mega-hit, ‘Short Dick Man.’ Do you remember that song?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, it doesn’t leap immediately to mind.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nWell, as I kind of just implied ‘Short Dick Man’ was, in fact, huge and this big global hit and yet people were paying attention to these artists and stuff coming out of the Chicago scene. They were sort of like Douglas, they wanted a way to, like, make a fun record that hit back against some of the misogyny that was going on in dance music at the time. Manny Mohr who is part of the 20 Fingers writing and production team just felt very frustrated by all that. So that’s kind of where ‘You’re a Dog’ comes from.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this one was released in 1994. Does that mean that they are legally the authors of the song ‘Who Let The Dogs Out?’', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo here we kind of need to maybe shift gears and talk about copyright for a sec.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nWhen you’re considering a copyright infringement claim, there’s two areas you really want to focus on and they’re access and similarity. The latter, similarity, is pretty straight-forward. It’s like do these things look or sound the same? But even if two things seem very similar, which of course it’s subjective, the courts will recognize there’s a finite number of ways to arrange notes and words. So you also have to consider this concept of access, which in short means was the alleged infringer aware of the plaintiff’s work? What’s the line between copying in coincidence?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. And so did the Canadian DJs, did they hear this song by Gillette?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nStephenson and Williams claimed to have never heard of the song or anything about 20 Fingers. Based on Gillette’s charting and billboard and stuff, I find that a little tough to believe, but I have to take them at their word.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so legally, does Gillette and 20 Fingers have a case that their copyright had been infringed?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nI think they did, but at the time their label didn’t want to pursue it. There’s a joke about copyright being the right to be held up in court until you’re bankrupt. And if you’re like an indie label or something like that, you might not have the resources and assets to sue a major label who can just kind of treat their legal expenses the same way one might like marketing costs. It’s kind of all the same pot as long as you have a net positive result.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, that makes sense. So I guess the DJs are the ones with the legal claim to the song because they weren’t challenged by 20 Fingers. But 20 Fingers can say that they are the original authors of the song.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nNot so fast, Roman.', '[Clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Miami Boom Productions]', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n(laughs) So who are these people?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThis is Miami Boom Productions of Jacksonville, Florida with their song ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ which was written and recorded in 1992.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, my goodness.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThis duo is Brett Hammock and Joe Gonzalez, their stage names at the time ‘Be Nasty’ and ‘Miami Jay’, who are basically just like cool teenagers and they want to write, produce and perform Miami bass music. That was it. That was everything to them.', 'Brett Hammock:', '\\n“I actually had someone call me and they’re like, “Hey, I heard you and Joe’s song on the radio.” And I was like, “No, you didn’t.” He was like, “Oh yeah, I swear to you the ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ I just heard it on the radio.” We flipped it on and I’m just thinking somebody ripped off our track.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. So this is another set of people completely blindsided by hearing the Baha Men’s ‘Who Let the Dogs Out’ on the radio.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nCompletely. There’s actually this kind of an amazing story of where they came up with the hook. So these guys, they’re driving around Florida in their parents’ Chevy Astro van, they’ve taken the back seats out to make room for extra speakers and they’re blasting this album, ‘Kings of Bass’ by Bass Patrol. On that album, there’s a song called ‘The Mad Scientist’ and very, very low in the mix, like you can barely hear it if you’re not looking for it, there is a sample, and Brett and Joe didn’t know what it said. They’re making up lyrics and at some point, they just said, “Who let the dogs out.” And it kind of stuck.', 'Brett Hammock:', \"\\n“I just started throwing my arms out, ‘Who let the dogs out!'”\", 'Joe Gonzales:', '\\n“He was starting to annoy me driving.”', 'Brett Hammock:', '\\n“He didn’t take me as mocking him. He started doing it too. So we’re jumping around, hopping around singing this song we just made up and I looked at him and I said, “That’s a pretty good hook.”', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThat sample is actually saying, “Who’s rocking this dog’s house.” And it comes from ‘Pump Up the Party’ by Hassan. We should take a listen to this one. It’s not exactly the same. I would argue the Miami Boom stuff is transformative enough to be considered a new work, but you can really hear the seeds of it.', '[‘Pump Up the Party’’ by Hassan]', '\\nWho’s rocking this dog’s house. (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho’s rocking this dog’s house. (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this is the thing that Miami Boom heard and turned it into their version of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nCorrect.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou can see how it’s a progenitor, but it does seem like the leap between the two versions is greater in this one as opposed to a lot of the other ones that we’ve heard today.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nI would say this is more an instance of influence than copying.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Okay. So Miami Boom wrote this song in 1992.', '[Clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Miami Boom Productions]', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd was it released? Did other people hear it?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nVery few. And I only became aware of it because they had posted it to YouTube, which isn’t really great for copyright dating purposes because it’s like, who knows when it was recorded, but after kind of earning their trust over a couple of years and stuff, they eventually produced a bunch of stuff, like old flyers and one of the best things they produced were these floppy disks that had the original vocals and samples from the recording session.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nIn that box of floppies, there was even the original receipt from the Kmart where they bought them in Florida, so that was one way of dating it. Then I took those discs to a data preservation company in the UK called Cryo Flux who helped me identify the hardware that would have been used and then I found a DJ who had this piece of hardware and we opened them up. All the samples were there. And this DJ and producer, his name’s Mishnah, he’s also from Florida, knows a lot about Miami Bass, and he kind of verified for me there is no way that this was fake.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. Once you determine the veracity of their song, that it was out there in the world, does Miami Boom also feel like they’re owed something? Like in terms of the copyright of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out?’', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nThey definitely do and I think they also want credit given to their studio engineer, her name was Mama Do.', 'Brett Hammock:', '\\n“When I think about the times making this music, it was phenomenal. It was the best times of my life. The bottom line is I know where we believe it came from. There’s three names missing from that song and they’re sitting right here.”', 'Joe Gonzales:', '\\n‘We should own that song.”', 'Brett Hammock:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe story is fun because the song is kind of funny and light and it’s a carnival song, but there’s a real sadness to this.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. It’s difficult as an artist to think about people who aren’t given proper attribution, like being cut out of a financial deal is one thing. But to be unknown when your song is known globally, I think hurts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Okay. So I feel like I need to recap here a little bit. So let’s go through all the versions. So first, here’s the Baha Men playing the version that we all know. (clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Baha Men)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich they got from Anslem Douglas in The Bahamas. (clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Anslem Douglas)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich he got from the Canadian radio DJs in the mid-’90s. (clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ jingle by Wrecked Shop Radio)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut before them, Gillette and 20 Fingers wrote this version in Chicago in 1994. (clip of ‘You’re a Dog’ by 20 Fingers)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBefore that, Miami Boom wrote this in 1992. (clip of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ by Miami Boom Productions)', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. Roman, I hate to keep doing this to you, but there is more.', '[High school football stadium chant]', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what is that?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah. After I started doing some research and getting a little pressed, this guy John Michael Davis from Dowaigic, Michigan, learned about what I was doing and got in touch and he told me this story that starts in 1990 in Dowaigic. And then, it was sort of like a down and out place, had this nickname, ‘The Dog Patch’ and the town really needed like something to rally around. So Jonathan tells me this, like Rudy-like tale of high school football where there’s a Hail Mary pass and he just starts chanting, “Ooh, Ooh, let the dogs out.” And then the whole stadium starts chanting it and then yeah, it just happens. I should preface and say that’s how he remembers it. Other people from this football team don’t remember it that way. Some people told me, a guy named Keith, the funky bus driver came up with it.', 'Ben Sisto:', \"\\nIt’s kind of a mystery, but what’s important is this team blew up. They won the state champion and this chant was their motto. So as part of the research we visited Dowaigic and just like locals were like, “Oh, what are you guys doing here?” “Oh, we’re researching ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.'” And people just started giving us VHS tapes and old silkscreens and there’s just all this stuff there with ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ on it from 1990. This team’s coach was named Bernard Thomas and he was so beloved, they called them ‘Saint Bernard.’ His players were like his dogs and it just made sense.\", 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo is the assertion that they’re making, is that this football chant traveled down to Miami to inspire Miami Boom?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nI think they’re not sure where it traveled to next or how, but get this, Joe from Miami Boom is originally from Michigan until he was like eight years old or something. So I plotted this Google map of all the places the chant appeared in Michigan after the Dowaigic Chieftains had this great victory year and that map formed a near-perfect circle around Joe’s hometown. I was like, “Are you kidding me?” So it just like was so clean. So I got in touch with Joe and he verified for me that he was there that summer visiting family, but he says he’s got absolutely no memory of hearing the chant, but also when I pressed him with the evidence, he wasn’t overly defensive about it.', 'Joe Gonzales:', '\\n“I feel like I will never allow to publicly say, I wrote that song you know called ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’ What I can say is, in 1992, I wrote a song called ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’ If you want to hear it, it’s on YouTube. That’s all I can ever say.”', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nSo as it turns out, ‘who let the dogs out,’ ‘let the dogs out,’ ‘let some dogs loose,’ these are all phrases that actually pop up here and there in regionals – high school sports – long before someone recorded a song, before Stevie B. So I’m scouring all these old newspaper archives. The earliest I’ve been able to find was from 1986: the Austin Reagan High School in Austin, Texas, their team, the ‘Raiders’ used it.', '[Clip from Austin Reagan High School pep rally]', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', '\\nWho let the dogs out? (who? who? who? who?)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHoly moly.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nYeah, that’s from a pep rally and it’s just a weird couple of seconds embedded in this much longer video chronicling the football team. It’s been on YouTube this whole time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what year is that?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\n1986.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat sounds more like the last version, like the final version than even some of the ones in between.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nRoman, it’s a wild ride.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my goodness. Oh my goodness. So is this, have we finally reached the bedrock of ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’? Do we actually know who let the dogs out at this point?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nWell, this is as far back as I can go. The title of the Baha Men song doesn’t have a question mark in it. And after looking into it all this time, I just have to accept that maybe it’s not a question. It’s probably unanswerable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen you started this, did you think it would be this hard to determine who wrote a single song?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nNo way. If I had known I would not have done this. But you know, it is a nice surprise and there’s been a lot of nice surprises along the way. I got to meet all these cool people and producers. Maybe I would have done it again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. There are all these sort of ways in which people borrow and they take in information, it becomes processed in their brains, maybe they spit it out as an homage or maybe they don’t know where it comes from. Do you think about how a song is passed between different people? Are some of them lying? Are none of them lying? Where do you sort of stand in everyone’s story in this story?', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nI don’t think anybody in this story is lying and I actually think people have been pretty forthcoming and open to the notion that you can hear something and it’s just in there subconsciously until it’s ready to come out. I think one of the big myths we tell ourselves about art is that it’s like made by individuals. And that myth is sort of what the art market is propped up on. Like from my own experience, I vividly remember being 20 at art school. I had this idea in woodshop class to make a box. And the box was going to have an audio tape that contained the sound of the box being made, just like youthful conceptual daydream or whatever. And this was my idea until years later, I learned that Robert Morris created a work in 1961 called ‘Box with the Sound of its Own Making.’ So it’s like, I don’t know, did I get the idea from him? Was it coincidence? Was it copying? I just can’t tell you. And I think that’s what’s cool about all the dog stuff. It’s just about the very nature of art and life. And I think that all these ideas apply to every piece of creative work ever made. (dog barking in the background)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s so cool. Well, I really appreciate you taking us on this journey. And maybe we’ll never know the answer to who let the dogs out, but the question is still worth asking.', 'Ben Sisto:', '\\nWell, thanks for having me. I’m surprised any time people want to hear me talk about this. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. Thank you. (dog barking in the background)', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt certainly surprised me to learn that ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ doesn’t actually have a question mark, but titles that are grammatically questions without actually being written as questions are surprisingly common. More on that after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’m in the studio with Chris Berube and you’re actually in town.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nI am. I’m in Oakland, California.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s amazing. It’s so good to have you here.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIt’s great to be here.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd you helped us put together this episode on ‘Who Let The Dogs Out,’ and one of the things that is kind of remarkable that is hard to convey in a podcast is that there is a kind of quirk to the title ‘Who Let The Dogs Out.’', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nYes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd that is, is that it isn’t a question, it doesn’t end in a question. ‘Who Let The Dogs Out’ is just the end of it. There’s no question mark at the end of it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nYeah, it’s a statement of fact, which is really strange. And actually, it reminded me when Ben was talking about the question mark, it reminded me of something that happened to be a year ago.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo I was hanging out with my friend, Liz, who’s a movie producer. We watch a lot of movies together and she’s like, “Hey, have you seen Who Framed Roger Rabbit!?” And I tried watching it as a kid. It’s really scary when you’re a little kid because they’re very mean to the cartoons. So I was like, “You know what? Yes, let’s give it another try. Let’s put it on.” So she turns the movie on, and then immediately, I’m like, “Oh, there’s something really weird about this movie.” And she’s like, “Oh, that the humans and cartoons are interacting?” I’m like, “No, that is fine. That is logically consistent to me.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThere is something else right when the movie starts that really bothered me.', 'Liz:', '\\nIt starts with a very lovely kind of jazzy low blue note, and then the movie’s titles fade onto screen. It’s literally the first visual of the film and it’s ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit!’ except instead of a question mark, it is phrased with an exclamation point at the end. So not ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit?’, but ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit!’.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo that’s my friend, Liz, who I watched the movie with. And she told me there’s a very specific reason for that. And it’s because the director of the movie, Robert Zemeckis, gave this interview where he said, “There is a superstition in Hollywood that if you put a question mark at the end of your title, the movie will bomb at the box office.” And when you think about it, there’s lots of examples that back that up. ‘So What’s Eating Gilbert Grape’ is a statement of fact.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nStatement. Okay.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\n‘What’s Love Got To Do With It’ with Tina Turner is also a statement. And what’s weird about it though is this is not a superstition that everyone follows.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo there’s lots of examples where they don’t use the question mark and there’s lots of examples where they do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Liz:', '\\nSay for example, ‘Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner.’ I think that came out in 1967. It’s a huge, huge hit. It’s got Spencer Tracey, it’s got Sidney Poitier. It’s ‘Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner.’ No question mark. And I always took that as an example of a movie like, “Okay, they followed the rule.” Contemporaneously, you have ‘Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?’, which is Liz Taylor’s huge, huge, huge comeback. Massive, massive, massive hit. You have ‘They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?’ starring Jane Fonda. That’s got a question mark. That’s a huge hit.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo it’s not precise. So you have movies like ‘Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner’, which do really well, but then you have all these other movies at the same time, which were also doing well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo Liz and I were looking through all these titles in history and trying to figure out some pattern or some rhyme or reason to why you put in a question mark. And what we noticed is that there’s lots of dramas that don’t use question marks. So ‘What’s Eating Gilbert Grape’, really serious movie.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut comedies use them all the time. So ‘Dude, Where’s My Car?’, that is a question.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\n‘O Brother, Where Art Thou?’, that’s a pretty goofy film. That is also a question.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd Liz’s theory about this is it’s really, the question mark really sets you up for a certain kind of mood-', 'Liz:', '\\nI would say sort of, of zaniness or wistfulness, it’s sort of like one or the other. So you have ‘What About Bob?’, which has a question mark at the end. Because it’s kind of like, “What about Bob?!” And it makes you feel kind of cheerful and goofy. You’re waiting for the punchline, you’re waiting for the shoe to drop. It’s like being told the first half of a joke.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo ultimately, there’s kind of no rhyme or reason to this. There’s lots of movies with question marks, there’s lots of movies without question marks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut what Liz explained to me, which is interesting, is it really isn’t keeping with how the movie industry makes decisions, that one thing does really well and then they kind of try to guess if that thing is going to do well-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat was the thing that did it? Yeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\n… again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo she says it’s part of this bigger pattern where people are trying to guess things in this industry where success can sometimes feel totally random.', 'Liz:', '\\nYou can’t fully predict how people are going to act. And some people get very, very into these nitty-gritty sort of, “Oh, people don’t like leads with blonde hair this year. That remake flops, we’re never going to make remakes for 15 more years. That musical did really well, so now we’re going to do 30 more musicals.” I mean, these kinds of superstitions are just trying to put lightning in a bottle and trying to blight any kind of rhyme or reason to what is ultimately such a multi-variant and shifting public mood that will put or not put money in your pocket, that you’ll latch on to stuff like question marks in the titles, which is the equivalent of wearing the same pair of shorts for every NCAA finals game you play in.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo ultimately, there’s kind of no answer to the mystery except to say that all creativity and art is a mystery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what I think I take some kind of delight in is the potential that there’s these sweaty people in suits really vexed over whether or not a question mark should go next to the title or not.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAbsolutely. And what is this telling our audience? If we are telling them, “Dude, where is my car”, as a complete sentence.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, I kind of love it. So I guess I… There’s so much of what we do on the show is to think about all the thought that goes into things. And often the result is a beautiful object, or a functioning street, or a curb cut or whatever. And this is truly like deck chairs on the Titanic. I mean, this is…', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis is truly ‘we don’t know how this works.’', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe don’t know what’s going on. It probably means nothing.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nRight. We’re going to make all sorts of decisions-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s going to be a meeting about it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo it is a whole meeting to decide whether or not ‘Dude, Where’s My Car’ is a statement or a question, and if that is going to influence whether a teenager is going to go see that movie.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. Oh, I love it. I love it. Okay. Well, that’s a mystery unsolved. But I’ll now think of it whenever I see a poster and someone deciding that this is a declarative statement versus a query, which is awesome.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nCool.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThanks, Chris.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThanks, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Ben Sisto and Chris Berube, edited by Emmett FitzGerald.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnyone who has listened to this show knows that I love the stories from history and one of the things I love the most is that a history story in and of itself has a certain value, but what’s amazing is how much the current situation that you’re hearing the story in affects how it’s understood. It’s like adding a musical score to a scene in a movie. The mood of the current moment changes our interpretation of everything.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is all leading me to introducing you to a brand new history show that we have premiering today from Radiotopia. It’s produced and hosted by the immensely talented and recently mustachioed Jody Avirgan, who you may know from ESPN’s “30 for 30” podcast and he was the host of the “FiveThirtyEight” politics podcast for many years. I am a huge fan of Jody. I’m so excited he’s joining the team. In this episode, I’ll talk with him and premiere two episodes of his new podcast, “This Day in Esoteric Political History.”', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHey, Jody.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nHello there, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor context, we’re talking on Friday, March 27th, each in our respective homes, me in California, you in New York City. We’re going to talk about your new show on Radiotopia.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThat’s right. I’m really excited to join Radiotopia. I just want to confirm, though, I’m recording in my bedroom, which has two windows. You’re recording in your bedroom, which I believe listeners learned in a previous episode has five windows? I just want to make sure.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYes, five windows. I live on the corner. My bedroom is on the corner of the house, so it has five windows, which makes it very good for sun, very bad for recording, to tell you the truth.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI thought both of those things. I got immediately jealous and then I got immediately, started to do the calculus of how is he making this room quiet?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s not been fun.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nIt was brave of you to admit as much on a national radio show. Anyway, the task at hand, yes, I’m joining Radiotopia, which I’m incredibly excited about. We’re doing a new show that’s called “This Day in Esoteric Political History.” Basically, a couple of times a week, I’m going to get together with a historian, Nicole Hemmer, and we’re going to have special guests along the way as well and look at one item, one moment that happened on that day in political history. The show is going to be short, it’s going to be under 10 minutes each time, and we’re just going to try and kind of pick a bunch of moments, big and small, that are either interesting stories, but I suspect will also have some things to teach us about this moment that we’re going through right now.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, one of the things I’ve noticed in the conversation about coronavirus and even Trump, as we’ve been talking about Trump for the past couple of years, is we’ve been falling back on this idea that all this is unprecedented and I think that helps describe the enormity of everything, but I don’t think that description is very helpful beyond that. I think it’s much more useful approach to find little threads of connections that are precedented so that we continue to learn and evolve and respond. That’s why I’m really excited about “This Day in Esoteric Political History.” How do you see the role of the things that you will tell stories about and how they connect with the modern world?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI mean, I think it’s born of the very same instinct that I think a lot of people have had and I’ve had, both as a journalist and just as a human being, to find myself thinking, long before coronavirus, over the last four or five years or so, saying, “Man, this feels new. This feels unprecedented. It feels like we’re in completely new territory.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI think like a lot of people, I have found myself turning to history more and more to get some guidance and get some guardrails. I’ve come to think that there’s basically three main ways in which history can help us understand this moment. One is to say, “No, this isn’t new. This has happened before. Look at this time, this time, and this time when basically this exact thing happened before.” There’s comfort in that. There really is. That’s not to diminish the seriousness of what’s happening now or a given incident.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThen there’s the second category, which is, “Oh, no, this really is new.” There are moments like that and I don’t want to dismiss that, but I think understanding where you need to raise the alarm and say, “Oh, my gosh, we are in uncharted territory.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThe third category is the one that I’m really fascinated by and I think I’ve really come around to and I think I want to try and explore in this show, which is things may be new, we may be in uncharted territory, but this moment is a product of history. The conditions that have built up in this country over the last 20, 30, 50, a hundred years have led us to this moment. That, I think, is the thing we don’t talk about enough, how what we are feeling is completely new and unprecedented and out of nowhere is actually a product of what has happened in this country and it’s almost inevitable, given the forces that have shaped politics in this country over the last few generations.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. We’re going to play a couple episodes of “This Day in Esoteric Political History.” One of the things I love about the name is when I was feeling this same need to examine the world and put out a podcast by diving into history, I called it “What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law,” which is-', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah, I thought of that, too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n… which is equally cumbersome.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nIt just rolls off the tongue. Well, I also appreciate that you, in Slack, recently tried to like acronymize it or whatever. T-D… I saw that, I was like, “Nah, we’re not going to be doing that.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nT-DIE-PH.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThis Day, maybe, yeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, so “This Day in Esoteric Political History.” We’re going to play a couple of episodes of “This Day in Esoteric Political History.” The first one, could you tell us about what happened on this day and tee up the story that we’re going to hear first?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah, on March 31st, we’re going to be talking about March 31st, 1968 which is when Lyndon B. Johnson, a sitting president, incumbent president, in an incredibly tumultuous year, 1968, he announces that he’s not seeking re-election. We’re going to be visiting 1968 I suspect a lot over the course of this series, but this was obviously a big event when a president, only the second time ever that a president says he’s not going to seek reelection. It just gives us a sense for what it feels like to be in the midst of a really tumultuous year. I think we’re certainly feeling that right now.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, let’s hear it.', '——————————————', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nHello and welcome to “This Day in Esoteric Political History” from Radiotopia. My name is Jody Avirgan. This day, March 31st, 1968, LBJ’s surprise announcement that he is not seeking re-election. We are joined as always, well, this is the first time, actually, but we’re joined by Nicole Hemmer of Columbia. Niki, I’m very excited to be doing this series with you and this is our first episode. Hi.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, I’m really excited about it.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI know we call this show esoteric political history. We will hit all sorts of different types of stories, but this is obviously a big moment, a president announcing that he will not seek re-election. I guess one thing is I can hear our more lefty listeners here in 2020 maybe a little, hopefully, saying to themselves, “Wait a minute. An embattled president in a moment of crisis, you can just announce that you’re out, that you no longer want to run? How often does this happen?”', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, it doesn’t happen very often. Don’t get your hopes too high.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nOkay, fair enough.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nI think it happened one other time with Truman and like LBJ, he had a little bit of extra time at the beginning of his term because he was a vice president who inherited the presidency.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nLet me lay out some of the basics of the story and then we’ll come around to what we think it means and some more, but LBJ made this announcement at the end of a 40-minute address from the Oval Office. It was ostensibly an update about the Vietnam War, but then at the end of his address, he famously says, “I shall not seek and will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as president.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nHe’d, as you mentioned, taken over for Kennedy after the assassination in 1963. He trounced Goldwater in the ’64 election. What else? The Civil Rights Act, his domestic agenda, but by this point, Vietnam is really the thing that is swamping his presidency, right?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah. It’s something that I think is hard to wrap our minds around when we’ve been at war for 20 years now and the wars that we’re in just don’t intrude in most people’s daily lives, but Vietnam was a lot different. It was part of people’s daily lives. They would listen to a 40-minute address from the president and it affected everything that was happening in America at the time.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nWell, I’m having conversations with my parents these days and with this pandemic, they’re talking about how this is the first time in a long time since Vietnam where they have felt like there’s an issue that is touching every American. I mean, this story of war – I’m sure we’ll track this over the course of the show – but the story of war is that it has become more and more separated from the lives of daily Americans.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nI think that’s such a good point because even something like the September 11 attacks, which I think most Americans had a really visceral reaction to, were localized, right? It was Pennsylvania, New York, and DC and the actual events were only taking place in small parts of the United States, whereas this is going to come to every city and town in America.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nA little more about this announcement by Johnson. He had health issues. He had had gallbladder and kidney stone surgeries, heart issues. He actually died four years later. He had apparently come close to making this announcement in October, December, and January and finally did it here. There’s reporting that it wasn’t in the advanced text, so I mean, the circle of people who knew this was incredibly small and it really did come as a shock. I heard some people even thought it may have been an April Fools’ joke because it happened on March 31st.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nRight. I think that it was far too serious a speech for it to be an April Fools’ joke, but-', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThat’d be a pretty messed up thing.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nIt would be, it would be. Things were pretty dire when it came to Vietnam at that point. I mean, just a few months earlier, the Tet Offensive had been launched, which really showed Americans that the war was not going their way and also that military and political leaders weren’t telling them the truth about the war and that had a real effect on Johnson’s approval ratings. Here he is starting up his bid for reelection and his approval ratings at the time of the speech where something like 30% of people approved of him. It was really low.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nBut then what happens when he announces that he’s not going to seek re-election?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nAll of a sudden, people love him. Once they know they don’t have to put up with them anymore, Americans flip, they go from 57% disapproving of him to 57% of them approving of him.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYes. That would not happen today. I mean, you look at approval ratings and they’re so steady and they’re so dictated by polarization and partisanship that I don’t think we will see swings like that, that inherently means people are crossing party lines in their approval.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah. I mean, that’s been the remarkable thing about the Trump presidency is how stable his approval ratings have been throughout. If you go back earlier in the mid-20th century, you saw wide ranges of approval and you saw presidents like Dwight Eisenhower, who was a Republican, pretty regularly getting 70% public approval. It was a very, very different time then.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah. In his remarks, he hints at this thing that got me thinking about the fact that he has to focus on all of the challenges before him. Then he has also been asked to run for re-election and he basically says, “I can’t do both of these things, so I am going to try and do my job until the end of this year and someone else can decide to campaign.” What does it mean that we ask these presidents to campaign in their last year in this way? The crises of the world don’t care that it’s an election year. They just show up and they can show up in the last year of a presidency as easily as they could show up in the first year.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nIt’s an extreme challenge to both juggle the presidency, which in the right hands, is a full-time job, and then layer over campaigning on top of it. It’s hard to do both really well and to not confuse the two. I mean, I think that’s where people often get in trouble is when you have to deal with a major crisis, but now you also have to go speak to deep-pocketed donors at a $5,000-a-plate fundraiser somewhere.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nCertainly, I think we have a president now who thinks he’s at his best when he’s in campaigning mode and I think thinks of everything basically as a campaign. Has anyone ever tried to split these two?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nA little bit. If we think about the Obama re-election campaign in 2012, he took his entire re-election campaign and he sent all of his people to Chicago and they were going to run the re-election from there and he was going to be governing in DC and I think that that kind of splitting… There’s only so much that you can do, right? It’s ultimately a fiction, but that’s one attempt to do it.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI want to wrap up with a big question about 1968 and these other moments in history that feel incredibly tumultuous. You look at 1968 and you say, “Goodness. Wars, riots, assassinations, presidents not running for reelection.” Some of these are obviously linked to each other, but I guess I’m trying to figure out whether there are just these areas of overall instability where it’s just one of those years in which big, messy Epic things are going to happen, maybe even if they aren’t directly tied to each other. Do these things tend to group?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nThat’s a good question. The answer is sort of yes and no. I’m not sure that the assassination of Martin Luther King led to the assassination of Bobby Kennedy, but if we take a bigger picture look at things instead of looking just at ’68, like look at the ’60s as a whole, there had been a lot of fractures forming for the whole decade, right? You had the Cuban Missile Crisis, which had the whole world on the brink of nuclear apocalypse, you had the assassination of John Kennedy, you had the Civil Rights Movement and racist murders and violence that were happening pretty regularly, urban uprisings, so by the time 1968 rolls around, a lot of the things that happen are kind of over-determined because of all of these fractures that had been caused earlier.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI remember in 2016 we had a few conversations on the “FiveThirtyEight” politics podcast, which I did during that election that were basically, “Is this 1968?” I think what I’m realizing in retrospect was that 2016 was not our 1968, it was the beginning of the process that you just described and maybe now, four years later, we’re having our 1968.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah. If you think about all of the things people have pointed to as weaknesses in the American system revealed by 2016, we’re now in a moment with a pandemic where all of those weaknesses are starting to cause even bigger and more catastrophic problems.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nWell, on that cheery note, we will end our first episode. That is it for today. Nicole, thank you very much.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nThanks so much, Jody.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThis was fun. Now, how can you get in with us and be part of this show?

My name is Jody Avirgan. Thanks again for listening. We’ll see you soon.', 'Lyndon B. Johnson:', '\\n“With America’s sons in the field far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe have the world premiere of another full episode of “This Day in Esoteric Political History” and more conversation with Jody Avirgan after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo could you describe the second episode, which is really relevant to the time we’re in right now?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYes. Our second episode, which is coming out on Thursday, April 2nd, we’ll play it for people here now, is it about when Woodrow Wilson got the flu in 1918 as part of the influenza pandemic of 1918. Actually, he got it in 1919 on April 2nd. This is where I should confess that we were originally planning this show to be about just elections. We thought this was going to be a tumultuous election year and we thought we’d do stories from previous elections. And then we did sort of change a little bit when the coronavirus pandemic began to feel like, “You know what? We want to make space for other stories in politics, other moments of crisis, other moments when this country has faced things like this.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nAnd so we’ve broadened the scope a little bit. And this is an example of the kind of thing that wasn’t necessarily an election year, but obviously a moment when our politics had to react to a pandemic. And, I think, one simple reminder is that Wilson got the flu. The president of the United States got the flu, basically a full year after the pandemic had started. And it’s a simple reminder that these things come in waves and these things go for a while.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, let’s hear it.', '——————————————', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nHello and welcome to “This Day in Esoteric Political History” from Radiotopia. My name is Jody Avirgan.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThis day, April 2nd, 1919 Woodrow Wilson has the flu. The influenza pandemic is sometimes called the 1918 flu pandemic. It started in Spring 1918. But it was the second wave, as we are all learning, in the fall of 1918 that was the most devastating with the disease spreading into 1919. That is when President Wilson reportedly caught the flu either right before or right after he arrived in Paris for another round of talks to try and bring an end to the First World War.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nWe’re joined as always by Nicole Hemmer of Columbia University. I’ll lay out what we know and don’t know about this moment in a second. But we should say right off the bat, Niki, that there’s a little bit of controversy about whether he actually had the flu or there were some other things going on?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, so one of the things that people know about Wilson and his health is that he suffers a pretty serious stroke near the end of his presidency. So, for a long time, historians talked about this illness as a mini-stroke that he had had. But if you actually look at the set of symptoms that he had, including a really high fever, none of them really fit a stroke, and they all sound a whole lot like this pandemic that was ravaging the world at the time.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah, I mean, by all counts, and we’ll talk a little bit about what the ramifications of this were, but he was very out of it. He was fever struck. He was sort of deteriorating rapidly over the course of these negotiations in Paris. One thing that’s interesting is that it was underplayed at the time, I guess. There were these questions about whether it was actually flu. But did they try and cover this up or was it just that sort of reports were murky? What did people know at the time?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah. So when this was first reported, it was just reported that he had a cold. And this probably isn’t surprising. I mean, was it a coverup? They didn’t often tell in detail the kinds of illnesses that presidents had at the time. There’s a much bigger cover-up that will happen later in his presidency about his health conditions. But in this case not wanting to scare people in the midst of both a war and a pandemic, they decided to just say, “Hey, it’s a cold. He’ll be fine.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nSo I want to get to some of the sort of bigger questions around this, because, for one, it’s really kind of stunning how precarious of a situation this is. We have a leader at a meeting with all of the, what is known as The Big Four who are negotiating the end of World War I. Wilson’s doctor says, “The whole of civilization seemed to hang in the balance.” Is that a doctor being a little dramatic when he’s writing his memoirs? Or is this really one of those moments?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nThis is really one of those moments. Here it is after the most devastating war that the world really had ever seen, and now they’re trying to figure out how to bring it to a close. And somebody like Wilson would have been the perfect person to have at that table. This is something he had been thinking about, how to win the peace, for a really long time and now he shows up at the peace table and he’s kind of a mess.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah, and it comes down to the fact that he just can’t concentrate as well as he normally would. He just doesn’t bring it. And it’s a reminder that we elected these people and we’re electing real people who have to go into real meetings with other real people. What they say and how they behave in those actual meetings is just as important as all the policies and all of the track record and all that stuff. It comes down to the sort of behavior in that moment. And there are theories about the fact that World War I may have ended very differently had Wilson been on his A-game, in particular with regards to what happened to Germans.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, one of the things that Wilson really wanted was a gentle peace with Germany. He was really worried about a vindictive peace that would be about score-settling, because he knew that they needed to rebuild a peaceful, functioning, cooperative Europe after this if they were going to maintain peace beyond the end of this. It was something that normally he would have pushed for. The flu is part of it. He also gets delivered a pretty devastating blow in the midterm elections of 1918, where Republicans sweep. And so there’s a sense of the country doesn’t necessarily want everything that Wilson wants. But, I mean, Jody, you’ve had the flu before. Can you imagine going to this table with the three other leaders of these countries and barely being able to sit up much less argue forcefully for the thing that you believe in?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nSo, one big question, this is sort of stating the obvious, but I kind of want to end on this note. But you don’t get to choose when pandemics hit, right? And I think it gets to this larger theme that so much of a presidency is defined by things you can’t plan for. And it’s really about how do you react in that moment. This seems like a perfect example of that.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, the tendency at the time was, the right thing to do is to downplay what’s happening because people have just come through this horrifying war. The last thing that they need is to be told that there’s this other invisible enemy that’s going to kill millions of them. But, of course, what we learn from it is, when you don’t have a handle on it, when you don’t tell people what’s happening, it actually just leads to even worse outcomes. And that’s what happened. I mean the press at the time was censoring news of this pandemic. That’s not the only reason that millions and millions of people died, but it was a contributing factor.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nSo, I guess one more question on the flu itself. If the public had somehow known… I guess this happens relatively late that he gets it. But I’m trying to imagine, do these moments where like, “Oh my gosh, a president got this!” Do those break through? Do those make a difference?', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nI think they do make a difference in the sense that you see that no one has the power or the money to avoid it, right? It’s one of those things that you can’t negotiate your way out of. We’re all vulnerable to it. I do think it’s fair at the same time though that seeing a president stricken with something like this can scare people, particularly at a time when they’re already pretty scared. It can be destabilizing.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThere’s this little meme, or whatever you want to call it, floating around… People use this term of like, “We must protect so and so.” And I think it was pre-pandemic, but now people are saying, “Oh, we must protect Beyonce”, or whoever. But also politicians. We have to keep these people healthy so that they can do their jobs because their jobs have massive ramifications.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nYeah, let’s just put it out there. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is somebody people have been trying to wrap in bubble wrap since three years ago. And, again, it’s been a powerful meme to say, “Do you want to be the person who gave this to a person who gave it to Ruth Bader Ginsburg?”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nOh wow. I hadn’t really heard that framing, but yeah, I guess that’s something to think about. Okay. We’re going to wrap it up there. But, first, a few other things that happened on this day, April 2nd in other years. In 1870 the first female candidate for president, Victoria Woodhall, announced her candidacy by writing a letter to the editor of the New York Herald. 1917, Janet Rankin was sworn in as the first female Congressman. And in 1964 on April 2nd, Malcolm X gave his “Ballot or the Bullet” speech. So every once in a while, we’ll give you a taste of other things that happened on this day.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nBy the way, this is what we’re doing on our social feeds as well, posting a few times a day about other things that happened. So make sure you check those out.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nAll right, Nicole Hemmer. Thank you. As always, this was great.', 'Nicole Hemmer:', '\\nThanks, Jody.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\n“This Day in Esoteric Political History” is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX. Our researcher and producer is Jacob Feldman. If you have any ideas for an upcoming topic or a date, get in touch. You can let us know a specific date or just a rough topic that you want us to talk about and we can find a peg for it. You can email us ', ' There’s also a contact forum at thisdaypod.com. Next episode, we’re jumping to the more recent past, 2008. Barack Obama and a comment he made about rural voters that may have said a lot about where politics was going over the next decade.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe’ve been talking about this for a couple of months and this was just going to be about the election and just use historical precedent to help describe the moment that we’re in, in terms of the election. And then the coronavirus pandemic started and we decided to move up the launch date a week. So, how were you thinking about the stories you will be selecting over this season while this is going on?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI do want to make space for stories, not just, “Oh we’re going to find stories of health crises or pandemics.” But, stories of just moments of national crisis. I think we are in a moment, clearly, of national crisis. I think we are going to enter a moment of what I’ve been thinking of as sort of civic creativity or civic rearrangement, where we’re really going to have to think through how our society is ordered and what our norms are. And politics is a space in which we do that, and we’ve had to do that, for better or worse. And so I think making space to talk about moments where we’ve done that, not just necessarily linked to an election year.', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nThat said, I will say that my co-host Niki Hemmer, who’s a political historian… When we were talking about making this change and expanding the scope a little bit, she pointed out and she was like, “Elections have never really been normal.” Most elections are huge and most elections kind of feel like they have a crisis and so forth. And so even if we had stuck to just the election lens, we would have had plenty of big, huge moments where it felt like, “Oh my gosh, our country is tearing itself apart or being torn apart.”', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI also do want to say, though, it’s very important to me to also just find small moments and moments that just are interesting. And I think we can find lessons in those, even if we don’t go out of our way to find big moments or big lessons and so forth. Just telling a good small story from our political past, I think, will still resonate. And I want to make space for the esoteric. It’s not just going to be meltdowns and influenza and so forth. We’re going to find some “fun” and interesting stories as we go as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd you’re going to do some of that on your social media accounts and stuff like that rather than just the podcast?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nYeah, so on social media, we’re going to be posting a few times a day actually about all the stuff that we don’t get to. We only get to do one topic per day, but we researched a ton. So just throughout the day and throughout the week on social media, on Twitter and Instagram, we’re just posting about so-and-so happened this day, so and so happened that day. And I will say, we’ve already got that going and I have found it really interesting. Some of the stuff that’s posted, I didn’t post, our producer posted it and sort of caught me off guard. And I said, “Oh my gosh. You know, on this day we announced that we had a polio vaccine. Or on this day Navy Seals were formed.” And just little tidbits that make you stop and think and draw your own little lessons or whatever. So, I’m actually pretty excited about the social media stuff we’ve got going on as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou were in “The Brian Lehrer Show” and you were on “FiveThirtyEight.” You often react to things in realtime and are the producer and host of these discussions. Have you missed that role during this period of time when things are happening? Or have you been happy to not be part of it, in the direct conversation?', 'Jody Avirgan:', '\\nI think both. I think anyone who is a journalist when there’s a big story and someone who believes that journalism has a role. It’s been tough for me to feel a little bit like I’m sitting on the sidelines. But I also think that stories like these, looking to history, stories that kind of talk to a moment but not necessarily about a moment are really important. And so I do feel like this is my chance to engage and my chance to contribute something. Going into this year, I sort of thought, “Well, do I want to cover this election again in the sort of day-to-day way I did in 2016 and the three elections before that?” And I basically decided, no. I mean, I like to sleep. I have a kid now. It was like 2016 took a few years off my life. And so this feels like a good balance.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“This Day in Esoteric Political History” is produced by Jody Avirgan and Jacob Feldman. It’s new from Radiotopia.

Because people are not commuting as much, podcast listenership is down, not by much, it’s like 5% or so. But the thing is, this is part of the economy that you can support without spending a dime. If you go through the 99pi catalog and download or stream just one extra episode this week, that 5% decrease will be eliminated and we’ll maybe even see an overall increase. Or you can go download and listen to the whole omnibus and pick one episode to send to friends. People seem to really like that “At Home” episode I did a couple of weeks ago, so maybe send that one around. The point is, this is a thing where a free and joyful task could do a lot of good and keep the show healthy and strong. So, thanks.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe only truly accurate map of the world would be a map the size of the world. So if you want to make a map useful, something that you can hold in your hands, you have to start making choices. You have to choose what information you’re interested in and what you’re throwing out. These choices influence how the person reading the map views the world. But a map’s influence doesn’t end there. Maps can actually shape the place they’re trying to represent. And that’s when things get weird. I love a good map and today we have three short stories about how maps have changed the real world in big and small ways.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so Kurt Kohlstedt is in the studio with me and he also loves maps. And you’ve written a ton of articles about maps and map projections. And even- you did an article about the design of pins on maps.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOh, yes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo the love is deep.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt’s real.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’re going to talk about actually one of your favorite geographical oddities and that’s exclaves and enclaves. And these are bits of land cut off from their home countries in various cool ways.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And they take a lot of forms and it gets complicated pretty fast. So I just wanted to start with something simple that listeners out there might recognize. When you look at a map of the United States, there’s this little bump up in the middle and it’s called the Northwest Angle and it sticks up from Minnesota into Canada.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Okay. I know that one. That’s basically how non-Minnesotans know where Minnesota is and tells it from the other states up there. It sort of breaks up this clean straight Canadian border running along the Western US and then when it hits the Great Lakes, you get this bump.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nExactly. So like on the left it’s all kind of a straight line and on the right, it starts getting zig-zaggy. It has a really kind of neat origin story, but I’m not going to go there today. Suffice it to say cartographical errors were made. And for me, growing up in Minnesota, I actually always tended to picture this notch as a piece of land, like a solid, because it’s part of the shape of the map. But it’s actually not, or at least not entirely. The Southern portion of the angle is water, and above that, there is a patch of land and that’s what’s known as a ‘practical exclave.’', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA practical exclave. So I know the basics of exclaves and enclaves. These are areas of land that are isolated or separated in some way from the rest of the country. But what does a practical exclave mean, like in this case?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBasically the land in the angle is surrounded by Canadian land on most sides, but below it has this area of American territorial water, which is basically a really big lake. So practically speaking, someone who wants to go directly there without leaving the US, they could do it by boat. But on land, they’d actually have to drive through Canada to get back into this slice of America, which isn’t impossible, it’s just impractical.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Okay. That makes sense. This actually reminds me of Point Roberts, which we actually sent Sharif to, to do a little story a while ago where he went to the post office that people go to on Point Roberts. That’s pretty cool.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And it’s totally in that same category of exclave as Point Roberts, though in the details, they’re really different. The angle is huge. It’s much bigger. It’s relatively remote and it’s really sparsely populated by comparison. It only has around a hundred permanent residents or so. And the crossing stations are correspondingly pretty minimalist.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what does it take to cross the border at the Northwest Angle?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nFor a long time you had these little shack-like buildings called ‘Outlying Area Reporting Stations’ or ‘OARS,’ and you had to do a video call with a border agent.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou Skype.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYou’re right, you basically Skype into the border patrol. They kind of look you once over. You show them your passport and you’re on your way. I mean it just wouldn’t be practical to staff these things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s ridiculous.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. Yeah. And then I’ve been reading about this because I haven’t been up there in a while and apparently over the last few years they’ve been working on streamlining things with a mobile app called Roam, spelled R-O-A-M. So a way that you can check in without really going through all these hoops.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so cool. So yeah, you have Point Roberts, you have the Northwest Angle. You know these are fairly regional examples, like people that live there interact with them, but most people don’t interact with them. Are there ones that have bigger impacts on the world in general?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, I mean there’s ones that people never really think about. A really good example is the whole state of Alaska.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, of course.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo Alaska is considered to be what’s called a semi-exclave and it’s actually the largest of its kind in the world. It’s got this semi-modifier because even though it doesn’t border the lower 48 it does have this really long stretch of international coastline, so it really has direct access to international waters.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, right. Okay. So those are exclaves. I think those are pretty easy to understand. So describe what enclaves are because those can be pretty strange.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThey really can. I should note here that there are some nuances to all this and a lot of complexity, like some enclaves are also exclaves. But in the simplest and most general terms, enclaves are countries or parts of countries that are entirely contained within another country’s territory. So they’re totally surrounded.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Northwest Angle and Point Roberts and Alaska, they don’t count because they aren’t cut off completely from the US. You can still get to these places by boat, for example.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, exactly, whereas enclaves are fully enclosed. So San Marino in Europe is a classic example. It’s this relatively small country and it’s completely enclaved on all sides by Italy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMaybe it’s because the US is so isolated and on its own and surrounded by water that, that feels weird to me, to be enclosed in another country. I mean maybe if you’re like the Czech Republic, you’re surrounded by other countries-', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, or like Luxembourg or something. It might not be one country, but it’s still pretty small.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut there’s still something kind of special about being a country completely inside one other country.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, yeah. You’re kind of dependent on them in certain curious ways. And that’s sort of just the first level of this, too. These things get even more complex and even more small in a lot of cases. For example, with counter-enclaves, which are an enclave inside of another enclave or more specifically like a piece of the Netherlands, inside a piece of Belgium that is itself in the Netherlands.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo they’re like second-order enclaves or like enclaves in enclaves.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYes!', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEnclaves all the way down.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAll the way down. And as crazy as those are, it doesn’t stop there. Consider counter-counter enclaves, like a piece of India inside a piece of Bangladesh, inside a piece of India, inside of Bangladesh. And in fact that triple-enclave example is the only known third-order enclave in world history.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Well, that makes sense that would be the only one. I mean it’s so absurd.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean it’s pretty hard to picture. So how does that even work in the real world?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo basically for a long time, there were villages within villages and at the middle of it all was this two-acre parcel that was owned by a Bangladeshi farmer who lived in the surrounding enclave. He would just wake up in the morning and cross into India to farm his tiny patch of land in the middle of this zone. Then he would cross back into Bangladesh each night. In 2015, India and Bangladesh finally agreed to this really big cross border land swap to essentially tidy up all these enclaves within enclaves. Essentially they ended up handing over dozens of enclaves to each other, totaling thousands of acres.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDid that mean that there were Indians now living in Bangladesh and vice versa?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI mean, yes, in some cases. I actually thought they handled it pretty well and pragmatically. They basically offered residents of these former enclaves a choice. They could either stay where they were and basically be in a different country than they had been before, or they could move “back across the border” to their official country of citizenship. It all kind of reminds me this isn’t quite technically an enclave or an exclave thing, but once you start thinking in these terms, there are some other interesting geographical mind benders out there. So I’ve got one more for you and as far as I know, this place has no official name, so I’ve just been calling it ‘Inception Island.’ It’s a pretty normal Island located in Canada, but apparently as far as I can tell, it’s also the world’s largest known island in a lake, on an island, in a lake, on an Island.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like ‘Inception,’ like there’s a dream within a dream, within a dream kind of thing.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nExactly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s why you call it Inception. I get it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt kind of blows my mind in the same way too, right? Like I have to do some like mental accounting to keep track of the what within what as you go along.', 'Inception Clip:', '\\n“Now in a dream, our mind continuously does this. We create and perceive our world simultaneously and our mind does this so well that we don’t even know what’s happening.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDoes the top keep spinning? Who knows?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWho knows?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWho knows. And so, of course, we have pictures of these all on the website.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOh yeah, of course.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCool. That’s awesome. That’s at 99pi.org Thank you, Kurt.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, anytime Roman.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nUp next is Joe Rosenberg.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOkay, so Roman, the best way to get into this story I think is with kind of like a mental exercise. Are you game?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m definitely game.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAll right. What I want you to do is imagine that you are taking a stroll through the British countryside.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, does it matter where in the British countryside?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nActually no, it actually doesn’t matter. That’s kind of the point. It could be anywhere on the island of Great Britain.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so let’s ramble through the Lake District. I like a good fell. I could ramble on a fell.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nExcellent choice. Excellent word use.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWill there be hedges around there.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nDefinitely, definitely. Throw in a good hedge. Throw in some sheep.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m there in my mind. I’m rambling. It’s a beautiful place.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI’m glad you’re enjoying yourself. But here’s the thing, on this hypothetical ramble of yours, no matter where you chose to go, so long as you are somewhere on the island of Great Britain, after a while I can almost guarantee you will come across an object that looks like this. Here, let me show you a photo.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like an obelisk. It looks a little bit like a fatter squatter Washington Monument without a pyramid on top, which is like kind of a tapered concrete pillar. I can’t tell from the perspective how tall it is, though.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMaybe like four feet high.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Yeah. So in the middle of the countryside, it’s very austere. It looks like a ruin kind of. It has a little vibe of something that has been left behind, but it’s cool looking. It’s evocative.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. Yeah. I mean for me it’s almost like a gray concrete version of the monolith from 2001. It’s just kind of there. And the thing is, is that these pillars are actually all over the place. No matter where you are, if you head out a few miles in any direction, you will keep stumbling upon these things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd they all basically look like this?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, they’re all identical, exact same shape, exact same measurements. It almost never varies. This one you’re looking at is in Wales. Let me show you a few more. This is one that’s actually in an island called St Kilda. It’s in the Outer Hebrides, super remote. There’s like abandoned settlements there. All there is, is a military base out there. But still, they have these pillars. There really are everywhere. Like for example, not just in these remote, craggy places. This one’s just in a field, in a farm field. We’ve got one here that’s just in a kind of suburban backyard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what are they and why are they everywhere?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo the actual technical term for these things are ‘triangulation stations.’ But in Britain, everyone just calls them ‘trig points’ or ‘trig pillars.’ And these trig pillars are the remnants of a centuries-long effort to do something that we today kind of take for granted, which was to make a topographical survey of an entire country.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so a topographical survey of the entire country. I kind of know what you mean, but what do you mean?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, yeah, yeah. You’re like, “Oh yeah, sure. The surveys, they’re doing the thing.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey have those things-', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd there’s topo maps and it’s all taken care of. The kind of broader contextual answers at least in Europe, as you get into the age of exploration and colonization, but also the age of nation-states with standing armies, there is an increased need for really spatially, accurate maps.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is because navigation and military actions and that sort of thing? You need to be more precise than you did before, is that the deal?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, exactly. I mean if you’re going to aim in artillery piece, you really need to know-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nKnow what you’re going to hit.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\n… what you’re going to hit, the curvature of the earth, things like this. Right. But the first top graphically accurate survey maps were only certain small areas, like maybe a coastline or a town. And it turned out that most of these maps weren’t even that accurate because anytime they tried to line them up side by side they were never in agreement. Like their longitude and latitudes would never sync up and it was hard to say which map was right or whether perhaps even all the maps were just filled with errors. There were no national maps. No national grid systems. Which is to say there’s no set of fixed reference points for all lower-order maps to use. And this was really frustrating. Just imagine for a moment not having a consistent map of the country where you lived.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Like every time you saw a big map in a classroom, the coasts would be all different and Florida would look crazy every time and that sort of thing. Everything would be different.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. Because nobody really knew and I don’t know about you but if that were ever taken away, I would feel its absence. And so in Europe, increasingly as you get into the 18th century especially, there is a desire for precisely that. A true God’s eye view of the land that would feel like you’re just floating many miles above the earth and looking down at what is actually.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this was kind of a new idea to be really accurate in this way.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, because Europe in the middle ages, you didn’t need to know exactly how far away Bruges was. It was a three days ride, and partway to the left. Right? And your field, it wasn’t that it was 255 yards long versus 257 yards long, it just ended where the copse of trees was, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt’s still the way we use subway maps today, which is something that helps you with practice. But now we’re getting into this era where there is a kind of practical need, but also you have this enlightenment idea that there is some kind of fixed, objective reality out there that we have been denied access to, up until now. We need to find out everything we can about it and master it somehow as part of our grand enlightenment project. And so in the 1700s, you begin to see more and more countries start to do national surveys and make the first spatially accurate national maps whose kind of official coordinates keep all the other maps in agreement. So by fits and starts in the 1780s and then officially in 1791, Britain is finally like, “Hmm, we should also probably know where everything is.” And they said, “You know, we want a national map too. Let’s do it.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGreat. Okay. So how do you go about making a national map?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWhere do you even start, right? When you don’t know where anything is and you’re not sure about anything’s location or the distance between things, what’s your first reference point? How do you decide where there is? And the answer is trig pillars. And this is what they did. They built two triangulation stations about 12 miles apart, kind of where Heathrow Airport is now. Then they used, just so they think, “I’ll get the measurement exactly right,” they used a series of glass tubes. I think each glass tube was 12 feet long and they just kept placing them end on end over the course of many, many months, until they finally could add them all up and say, “Okay, this is the distance between these two first triangulation stations.” Those two triangulation stations were within sight of the Greenwich Observatory. And the Greenwich Observatory, they were pretty sure they knew where the Greenwich Observatory was because it had all these telescopes with which to make celestial measurements. So the Greenwich Observatory’s longitude and latitude, they were the most confident in.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, right.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAll we need to do now is measure the angle between these two stations and the Greenwich Observatory and now we have the location and distance between all three of these objects. Once they had that, then they were off to the races because now you don’t need to physically measure, lay out rulers or glass rods or anything anymore. All you need to do is place a new triangulation, a third triangulation station, within sight of the first two. Measure the angles again and then you can just do all the math from the angles and you get to know the exact location of the third triangulation station. And then you can place a fourth a little further away. Again, as long as it’s within sight of two, get a fourth station, a fifth, right? And then you just daisy chain your way across the entire landmass.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. And in this case, you mean Great Britain and that’s why those trig points are everywhere.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nFor the entire island of Great Britain. Yes, with triangulation stations at every point.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. How long did this take?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe primary triangulation was finally completed in 1853, so it took 62 years. In fact, in 1935 they did a re-triangulation and this time it was much faster, it only took 30 years. And so all the trig pillars you see dotted throughout the countryside, I have to fess up are actually from the re-triangulation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese are the second ones from 1935.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And then the reason that they installed these new ones is the original ones were just holes in the ground. And there’s actually hilarious descriptions of where you could find them because they’d be like, “Oh, ask the farmer who lives at the end of the lane, and he’ll tell you.” You know what I mean? And those were in the official descriptions of where the trig points were. And they’re like, “This isn’t good enough. We need to make better trig points, more trig points.” And the reason they are all the exact same shape is because they are literally mounts for the surveying equipment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, okay. That makes sense. So in the end, for the full survey, how many trig points did they have to build?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThey built about 6,500 and today there are still about 6,200.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, wow.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s pretty good.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd believe it or not, there is one guy who has visited every single one.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“It happened bit by bit, really.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo this is the guy, his name is Rob Woodall. He is 59. He works for a water and waste authority in East Anglia and he honestly cannot tell you what compelled him to do this.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“You never set out to bag 6,000 trig pillars, but yeah, just gradually you get kind of sucked in.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI mean Rob likes the outdoors and he likes a good challenge, clearly. But when I asked him if there was some kind of philosophical reward in it for him, something to do with perhaps seeing all of Britain, he was like, “No.”', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“Yeah, intense discovery of stuff? I don’t know… I’m not that kind of guy, really. I’m not. I don’t have much poetry in my soul, I’m afraid.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo poetry in his soul, poor guy.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI think he’s being a little self-deprecating.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think for sure. Clearly, if he did this, he does, even though he can’t articulate it in that sense. What a remarkable human. I really like him.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, and in that sense, he’s not alone. He is part of a small but flourishing community of people called ‘trig baggers,’ who like to visit and catalog trig points. But so far, Rob is the only one to visit every single one. He says one guy was neck and neck with him for a while but retired at 5,000.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“For somebody else that had done 4,000 and then, unfortunately, I think he had a road accident so he gave up a bit after 4,000. There’s a lady called Carol Engel that has done I think something like 5,300. I mean she’s about 10 years behind me but she’s very, very keen.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYou know, I think for most of the trig baggers, the core poetic motivation is the same poetic motivation as anyone who decides they want to climb a mountain.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJust because it’s there.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nPrecisely because it’s there. Although, in this case, you might say there is a lot of there, there. Rob says it took him close to 12 years to visit them all.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“I got to kind of 5,000 of them relatively quickly, really. But the last 1,000 or so were really hard.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat makes the last thousand so hard.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWell, part of it is that some of them are just in really remote places.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat makes sense.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThere are some that are just on these sea cliff islands with no real place to land. So it’s almost like a mini-expedition just to get to them. A lot of them are also in these overgrown areas or places left to the elements in one way or another and Rob said a lot of trig pillars have started to kind of crumble away. There was one that was on the edge of a sea cliff apparently that a few years back was about to tumble into the sea.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“And yeah, so somebody noticed it had fallen over and then the next people went expecting to find it down at the bottom of the cliff. The farmer had actually managed to rescue it and pulled it back. You know, winched it back from the cliff and re-erected it a little way back and that was really nice.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut if the farmer put it back up, did he put it on the exact same point? I mean does it still serve as a trig point if you move it to another place?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nNo, he had to move obviously the point where it was, was now just in midair, and so we had to move it. So it no longer is a functioning trig point. And there is a further irony which is that all of this wear and tear can also make certain trig points somewhat paradoxically hard to find.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“Sometimes they just disappear completely and sometimes they actually reappear somewhere completely unexpected. There’s one that actually turned up in Scotland that I’ve not seen yet. Yeah, they do come back sometimes.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI don’t even know what that means.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt just means that they will disappear from their known location and then reappear in a new location and exactly what hands they pass through in between, no one knows. Rob actually says that at one point another trig pillar showed up on eBay and one of the UK trig baggers had to intervene to make sure it wasn’t sold overseas. Although most trig points, if they are interfered with, are interacted with and kind of more innocent ways. As more and more people have learned about them in recent years, more and more are getting painted. Let me show you a few. This is an English Rose. It’s kind of been stenciled on, a red English Rose. This is a-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWelsh Dragon.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWelsh Dragon. Very good. So obviously in Wales, but my favorite has to be the minions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s a straight-up minion.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt’s a straight-up minion but the proportions are very good.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nVery good.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSomeone realizes these things are minions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey nailed it.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThey nailed it. So it really is … I find it really quite charming. But the thing that Rob told me that really got me thinking is that the trig pillars are only the tip of a much larger surveying infrastructure that is actually all around us. Because those just provided the starting points for any given map. For all the lower order measurements, like the streets and the hills and the rivers and the slopes, surveyors used much, much smaller markings, really just these little notches made in the landscape. It’s sometimes with a small plaque called a ‘benchmark,’ but sometimes it was like a notch, just called a ‘cut mark.’', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“If you keep your eyes out, you tend to see it in the UK, anyway. You tend to see them. There’s huge numbers of them. There’s probably about a million of them put in, I would think.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s a million of these benchmarks just around the landscape. Wow.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThat was my reaction as well.', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“I’ve got one about 200 meters away from my house actually. Just chiseled into, I think it’s number 14, our estate.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\n“That’s incredible. And so someone like your neighbor down the street, do you know whether they know that, that mark is on their house?”', 'Rob Woodall:', '\\n“I’ve never thought of mentioning it, actually. They probably don’t. Might be fun to mention sometime. Bit of a strange thing to ask, really.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI guess the point is that these thousands of trig pillars and however many benchmarks and millions of cut marks are just kind of secretly all around us.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s so cool.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And they’re not just in Britain. Lots of countries have some form of physical surveying infrastructure in place. India has its own kind of triangulation stations. So does Japan and the US. The only reason we’re not as familiar with them is they’re not as dramatic looking. They’re more like cut marks. They’re just like little cairns or poles or plaques in the ground. They are everywhere. And it’s strange to think that there is this kind of invisible network of objects all around us that actually is responsible for giving us a way to look at ourselves from outside ourselves.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s kind of amazing. It gives us so much, these little things. That’s awesome. Well, thanks Joe.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRoman, thank you so much.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHere is Vivian Le.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nRoman, have you ever heard of a town called Occoquan?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSay it again.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHave you ever heard of a town called Occoquan?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, just say the town name again.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOkay. Occoquan.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNope. Never heard of it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOkay. So Occoquan is this beautiful little town in Virginia and it’s very old and it’s right on the water. It looks like pretty much the perfect setting for a CW drama about a prestigious East Coast boarding school.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPerfect.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“So it’s quaint and vintage and kind of playing up on the history and the country style, but also very upscale.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo who is that?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo that is Lauren Jacobs. She’s an artist and a teacher based in Northern Virginia. So in 2015, Lauren won a juried prize, meaning she’d get to exhibit and sell her work at a gallery in Occoquan called “The Artists’ Undertaking.”', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“The Artists’ Undertaking Gallery” is called that because it used to be the Undertaker’s house.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, nice. So it’s haunted.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s goth. Isn’t that cool?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI love it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThe town is 300 years old. So you could find a ton of these really cool historic sites like that around Occoquan.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“I mean it’s completely full of really interesting history. They have this famous ghost tour. And Occoquan has all of these kind of ‘certified ghost’ sites and ghost sightings.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat does she mean when she says a certified ghost? How do you get a ghost certified in this world?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThere’s an organization. They’ll come by and then confirm the validity of your haunting.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd I think I unintentionally made Occoquan sound like the town from ‘Hocus Pocus,’ but it’s actually this really nice area to go shopping. There’s lots of one of a kind mom & pop shops that tend to cater to definitely a wealthier demographic, who wanted to spend the day strolling along the river and maybe buying a $400 pair of sunglasses and then go antiquing. And this was more or less the type of clientele that Lauren’s gallery depended on for sales too.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“At the time, we were working a lot off of walk-in traffic, clients who were coming in and they were looking for a really special gift and coming in to spend several hundred dollars.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd I know this sounds like kind of a lot, but it’s not like the artists at her gallery were getting rich off of these sales. From what Lauren tells me, it was really mostly just people who wanted to have a presence in the local arts community, make their rent at the gallery, and then maybe earn just a little something extra on the side. And for a while, everything was going great.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe direction this is going indicates to me that things are not going to be going great soon.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd then-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then. Okay.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo in 2016, Pokémon GO comes out.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, okay. Well, that’s not what I was expecting. So Pokémon GO comes out. How does that change everything?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo have you ever actually played Pokémon GO?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI have not played it. I feel like I’m familiar with it a little bit. It’s kind of like an augmented reality game where you go find these creatures in the built-in environment.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nPokémon.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPokémon, right, right. Okay.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut you find… It’s like a scavenger hunt on your phone.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. I’m going to clarify it just a little bit.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, good.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo yeah, you’re right, it’s an augmented reality game and it’s based on your real-world location. So you’ll find things in the game by physically going to those places on the Pokémon GO map. So to capture a Pokémon, or there’s these things called ‘PokeStops’ where if you go there, you’ll get prizes within the game, like poke balls and potions and stuff. But you physically have to be at those locations in order to access things within the game.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. That makes sense. So it is a way to explore the environment. But that’s why I remember people walking around parks.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYes. Yes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nStaring at their phones.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd I remember the exact day that Pokémon GO came out and I remember exactly where I was because this was Podcast Movement 2016 in Chicago. And because the gameplay is based around real-world map data, usually the best places to play it are populated cities like Chicago or like New York. But sometimes these little random places just become hotspots for Pokémon activity, which is exactly what happened in Occoquan.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“Occoquan had always been this kind of sleepy town and you would go and it was very comfortable walking around on these picturesque historic streets and it was kind of this very relaxed kind of outing. And all of a sudden, it was like a river that was far too full teaming with fish. You just couldn’t walk down the streets they were so crowded.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. And so I can get why New York and Chicago and San Francisco would be hot spots. But how did Occoquan become Pokémon central?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, so Pokémon GO was created by this company called Niantic and years earlier, Niantic had come out with this other location-based AR game called ‘Ingress.’ And I’ve never played it before, but Ingress is this game where this mysterious trans-dimensional force appears and you as a player have to interact with these portals based on your actual GPS location. So it was kind of a similar concept of using your real-world location to access things within the game. But these portals within Ingress are all based around real-world landmarks. And the cool thing about Ingress, in particular, was that game users could add landmarks to the map within the game. So if you reach a certain level, you can add a historical site or a mural or whatever to the map. So years later when Niantic teamed up with the Pokémon company to release Pokémon GO, they reused the same map information and all of those portals within Ingress became Pokémon GO PokeStops.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo all those historical sites and even the certified ghost haunting sites all became PokeStops along the way?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. She told me that from… While she was working the gallery, from her seat, she could access two PokeStops without ever leaving her chair.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThank goodness for the ghosts.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut as you can imagine, this kind of sent the town into a tizzy because it’s such a small town and they weren’t equipped to handle the sudden influx of people walking all over the streets.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“In the beginning, enormous pushback. That summer, nothing but pushback. But mostly because the residents were like, ‘Well this has got to be… Can we just make it illegal?’ And the town kept on being like, ‘No. What? What? Illegal for what? What exactly you mean, that people should not be allowed to walk on our streets anymore? What exactly are you proposing?’ And the businesses are like, ‘Well, can we hang signs or something?’ I was like, ‘You can’t. What?’ When has a business ever hung a sign saying that a certain contingency of people isn’t welcome? Where you thought that possibly history would think that that’s okay?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Historically, she’s right. Historically, that is not a good look.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nNo.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt is immoral. Okay, so I do remember when Pokémon GO came out, that there were these stories of places being inundated with Pokémon GO players, especially trespassing on private property and all that sorts of… And what was one, I feel like there was other sort of sacred places or something like that.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, the Holocaust Museum had to be-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThey had to say, “Please don’t play Pokémon GO at the Holocaust Museum.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Yeah, okay.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo yeah, it was a big deal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI get it. But if this place is kind of meant for a little bit of tourist action, is there some way that they could have just capitalized on it and just sold more things or something like that?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYes. And this did happen. Lauren told me that there were businesses that kind of adapted and popped up to this influx of people, like snack shops would appear and tourist trap, souvenir type, Pokémon GO themed businesses. And she even said that there was a Pokémon GO cruise that opened up that would take you across the Occoquan River at just the right speed so that you could hit all the PokeStops. But if you remember, Occoquan was this place that was known for this kind of upscale shopping and the people who were going to Occoquan to play a video game aren’t going to drop in and buy an antique clock.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So they had the ability to kind of take advantage of a bunch of bougie rich people, but they didn’t have the ability to take advantage of 10-year-olds with iPhones glued to their face.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYes, exactly. They don’t know what to do with these children.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, they’re not buying antique clocks, these kids today.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, but not only were the children not buying antique clocks, because of all this foot traffic, the Pokémon GO players were pretty much driving away the regular clientele who helped pay the bills. Because you go to a place like Occoquan for the quiet vibe and the historic feel and all of a sudden it’s just teaming with a bunch of people on their iPhones.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“So yeah, it became kind of a big issue for the residents. Not only were we not seeing people in the gallery, the wealthy residents weren’t shopping in their neighborhood anymore, period. And we had this huge influx of people and instead of revitalizing the town, it completely destroyed commerce.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd this shift in business eventually trickled down into Lauren’s artwork because people were coming in wanting to spend around 20 to 40 bucks. So some of the artists at the gallery started making things that were smaller and cheaper and just generally more palatable to more people. And Lauren found herself doing the same thing.', 'Lauren Jacobs:', '\\n“My artwork has always been weird and contemporary and often creepy. And I was bringing in stuff that was more kind of homogenously whimsical and relatable to more people. And I think just more boring. It wasn’t serving my art at all. I announced that I was going to leave a couple of months ago and January was my last month that I was at the gallery.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHuh. Did things go back to the way they were? I mean, so Pokémon GO, it was a big deal a few years ago. It definitely feels like it’s dwindled. Are people still flooding the streets like it was in 2016 when this all started?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. I think a lot of people in town thought that this was just going to be a little blip on the radar too. But those core clients disappeared. And because of that, the stores that catered to those core clients disappeared too. And I’m not going to say that Occoquan is any worse or better than before, but this one game really disrupted the town enough that it changed it on a permanent scale.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And since Niantic reused the Ingress maps for Pokémon GO, if there’s a new game using that same engine, it’s going to happen again, right?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. Yeah. And they actually have reused the same maps for different apps that weren’t as popular as Pokémon GO. But theoretically, they could make something as popular, if not more popular than Pokémon GO and then they’re going to be in another cycle again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean it’s sort of an amazing phenomenon that you could sort of create a digital map that has so much effect on the real world. It’s kind of a strange amount of power we’re giving augmented reality that I’ve never really thought of before.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, yeah. How do you really regulate something like that?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean I don’t… Probably the answer is you can’t and you probably shouldn’t, but a map can really change the meaning of a place. And also, it makes you realize that a map for one thing isn’t a map for everything. So reusing these historic sites as popular destinations for cartoon characters… She has her head in her hands.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOh, God.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut reusing these historic markers for things that are a game, like obviously the Holocaust Museum isn’t the place for Pokémon GO.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut both things should exist in the world.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPokémon GO should exist in the world.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt should. It’s done a lot of great things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo I just wanted to give a special thanks to Lauren Jacobs, who I spoke with for the piece and also to Alistair Sticco, who was actually the one who wrote to us and made sure that we knew about this story. So thank you Alistair.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNice. Cool. And if people want to see Lauren Jacob’s self-described creepy art, where can they go?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nWe’ll have a link to it on our website.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay good. That’s awesome.

Others need a story that directly confronts our anxiety.

For our part of the show, 99% Invisible collaborated with Jon Mooallem and “The Brink Players” which featured members of “The Decemberists” and “Black Prairie.” It was the story of Genie Chance, a woman whose voice held a shaken city together in the time of crisis.

I’m Roman Mars.', '[audience cheers and claps]', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nIt was the middle of the night on March 27th, 1964. Earlier that evening, the second biggest earthquake ever measured at the time, an insane 9.2, had mangled Anchorage, Alaska. 115 people died. Houses turned literally upside down or skidded into the sea. There was no light or power in the city and for a long time, virtually no communication with the outside world, but there was radio.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“Are we on the air…? Yes…? We’re ready to go again.”', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nIt was a station in Anchorage running on backup generators and a cracked transmitter. A station in Fairbanks picked up that signal and repeated it. And a man in Juno somehow picked up that Fairbanks station, called a radio station in Seattle and let the broadcast play over the phone.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“The boy scout troop that went overnight to McHugh Creek, Bill Noble would like to get a message if they are all right.”', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nLike that, a voice from Anchorage touched the lower 48. A sign the city was still there and soon the degraded signal broadcast in Seattle was relayed and relayed again until eventually people across America, then around the world, heard the same woman’s voice.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“We have word here that Mary Sweet is asked to contact her mother. Mother is at home.”', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nThe president of that Anchorage radio station happened to be on a goodwill tour of Japan and when he turned on a radio in Tokyo, he couldn’t believe it. It was the voice of his own “newsgirl” back home. The woman’s name was Genie Chance. Jon Mooallem and the Brink Players have her story.', '2. MUSICAL OVERTURE', '3. OUR TOWN', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nIn 1964, Anchorage was the fastest growing city in America. The generation earlier, it had been a frontier town without a single concrete building. Now it had 100,000 people, but it was mostly military buildup and oil speculation. The city felt like a bubble that could pop. Alaska had only been a state for five years and as one man put it-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“You had the feeling that everything is temporary. We weren’t all going to leave, but you know, we might.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd that insecurity made every new construction feel monumental – it was a bit more proof to people that their city was real – like the brand new JC Penney building downtown. This was one of the first big chain retailers to build in Alaska. It was huge and nothing said ‘sophisticated civilization rising out of the wilderness’ like a five-story department store full of lingerie and blenders. [music plays]', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nThere were the beginnings of genuine culture in Anchorage too, like the city’s all-volunteer symphony, conducted by a moonlighting bulldozer operator and the Anchorage little theater, the community troupe run by a cosmopolitan guy in a turtleneck named Frank Brink. Brink found roles for everyone in his plays – housewives, judges, Air Force officers – and he worked his actors hard. He just staged his own three-hour epic of Alaskan history called “Cry of the Wild Ram.” I know it sounds a little bit like “Waiting For Guffman,” but they were good. Meanwhile, covering all this life in the city were two daily newspapers and five local radio stations, one of them, KENI, prided itself on being-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“The biggest radio network in the biggest state in the union.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd one of KENI’s biggest on-air personalities was a woman named Genie Chance. Genie was 37, she’d grown up poor in Bonham, Texas then came to Alaska with her husband a few years earlier, looking for opportunity. They only sort of found it, at first. He sold used cars and she watched their three kids at home, but Genie loved radio, so she started working construction every morning in exchange for childcare, then go to work all afternoon at one of the local radio stations. Back then, women were usually made to cover cooking or fashion, but at KENI, Genie turned herself into a gutsy roving reporter driving all over Alaska with a mobile broadcasting unit in her car. She flew with smokejumpers, covered Arctic warfare exercises, reported from Inuit villages and crab boats. Her voice was part of the city. People trusted her, respected her in Anchorage — and in a way women journalists weren’t always respected in 1964. Later, a New York paper celebrated her as-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“An Alaskan housewife and mother of three children who does a man-sized job with a radio microphone.” [audience laughs]', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nLate in the afternoon of March 27th, Genie was driving her 13-year-old son to a bookstore downtown. It was Good Friday and lots of people had already gone home from work for the Easter weekend. A banner across Fourth Avenue advertised that weekend’s opening at Frank Brink’s theater. They were doing the Thornton Wilder play, “Our Town.” Curtain was going to go up at 8:00, but at 5:36… [music plays]', '4. EARTHQUAKE', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nGenie’s first thought when her car started bucking at the red light was that she must’ve blown a tire, but then through the windshield, she saw people knocked down in the street. She saw a line of parked cars at the gas station slam together and separate and slam again. She watched them fold in and out and thought “It’s like a grotesque accordion.” Later one man would say it felt like the earth was whipping the city around like a dog shaking an animal he’s killed. Buildings listed off their foundations. The huge ground waves moved through the asphalt like the roads were liquid. At the JC Penney building, a school kid stuck in the elevator watched a book suddenly levitate off the elevator floor and hang weightless in mid-air, in front of him. For a split second, it was like he was in orbit, and that’s when he knew the elevator was falling. The quake went on like this for almost five full minutes, then it stopped. And the instant it did, Genie threw her car into gear. [music plays]', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nShe was a reporter after all and still not realizing how severe the situation was, she raced to the police station to get a quick story for the evening broadcast. Inside, all the filing cabinets were thrown over, ceiling plaster heaped on the floor. Then a second jolt hit and Genie’s son who’d gone off, came running around the corner shouting-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“Come quick! The Penney’s is falling down!”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAn enormous concrete panel had shorn away from the JC Penney’s exterior and fallen. Now the entire building was sagging. And running over, Genie watched a second panel lurch loose and drop with a roar. The scene was brutal. Jeannie stepped around part of a body in the snow, a person split in two by the falling debris. A Chevy station wagon was flattened, but she could hear a woman’s still alive inside calling to the crowd, trying to dig her out. Then, Jeanie rounded the corner, saw the whole impossible panorama. One entire side of Fourth Avenue that just dropped. For two blocks, everything was 12 or 15 feet lower in a ravine that had opened under half the street, and the crazy part was buildings were still intact down there. Cars were still perfectly parked next to their meters. Men looked up from outside a bar a dozen feet underground like stunned minors, and still hanging there over the street like a cruel caption over the surreal wreckage, was the theater banner that read “Our Town.” The quake had knocked Genie’s radio station off the air, but now the static on the transistor radio she was carrying suddenly gave way to music. It meant KENI was back. An engineer started talking and Jeannie grabbed the radio unit in her car and cut in.', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“Go ahead, Genie.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nShe was surprised later when people told her she sounded calm.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“It has become obvious that the earthquake that struck Anchorage less than an hour ago is a major one. We urge each and every one of you to seek shelter, check your emergency supplies, and plan to keep your homes closed as much as possible so that you can retain the heat. Check your neighbors. See if they have transistor radios. If they don’t, possibly they could move in with you and share one for the night. It seems like it’s going to be a long cold night for Anchorage, so prepare to batten down the hatches and stay tuned to KENI.”', '5. CONNECTOR', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nThink of what it means when we say “A person feels shaken.” In Anchorage, this wasn’t a metaphor. The whole city had been thrown. There’d only been about an hour between the quake and nightfall. With the power out and snow falling through a thick fog in the dark, there was no way for everyone to tell just how badly their world had been jumbled. The feeling of vulnerability, total dislocation, it was hard to describe. This one guy put it-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“You don’t know if anyone else is alive. Maybe you were the last man.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo it was comforting to hear another voice start talking to you, especially Genie Chance’s voice. After making that first announcement on the air, Genie drove back to the police station. Authorities realized that with the radio unit in her car, she was the only voice there able to address the entire city, so they told her to keep talking. Soon they got her broadcasting from inside the building and rounded phone calls to her as the lines reopened. It was up to Genie to decide what information to relay to the public. At first, it was mostly just her. One KENI employee remembers that the newscaster who’d been on the air when the quake struck, a hotshot they just hired away from a big station in Los Angeles, had been so wigged out that the second the shaking stopped, he walked out of the building without a word. He resurfaced a couple of weeks later, calling from back in California to officially quit. And Genie was shaken too. A week later, she’d break down out of nowhere and weep all night. But now…', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“I kept trying to forget the unforgettable scenes I’d witnessed, thousands of terrified people were huddled in their unheated shelters waiting for words of reassurance and instruction.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo she started doing her job, talking to people on the radio. Before long, the rest of her colleagues and other stations in town were back working the airwaves too, but still it often felt like Genie was the one at the center of things, directing things. “The turbine site needs diesel fuel,” she’d say, or “Here’s where electricians should report,” and then she started reading the personal messages pouring in too.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“Mr. and Mrs. Dick Fisher are still here at police headquarters waiting for any word of their children. We have a message from Northwest Airlines saying that the crew cannot locate stewardess Beverly Johns.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo many people were desperate to locate or reassure each other.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“Howard Forbes would like it to be known that he will be at Mike Whitmore’s.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd Genie was helping those people shout across the fractured city.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“A message to Kenneth Sadler. Mrs. Sadler is fine. A message to Walter Heart, Lee Heart is fine.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nMeanwhile, HAM radio operators were relaying those messages to families in the lower 48. And when reporters around the country finally got through to Anchorage, it was often Genie, still sitting in front of her radio microphone, who took their calls. No, she assured them the city wasn’t swallowed in flames and no, it wasn’t under martial law. She talked to Omaha, New York, London. One interview she did was rebroadcast in more than a hundred other places the same day. Friday night had become Saturday morning, and then Saturday afternoon, Saturday night.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“For the first 30 hours, I talked constantly.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd after two hours of sleep, she was right back on the air. [music plays]', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBut it’s probably worth stopping for a second to say this out loud. Earthquakes are (BEEP) up, but I mean in an existential way too. Imagine how dreamlike it must’ve been watching realities suddenly buckle around you. Watching your city of infallible right angles bend. It was enough to change a person’s worldview. More than 50 years later, a former mayor of Anchorage told me-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“Even now I can look at the solid ground out the window and know that it’s not permanent. It can change anytime. It just moves. Everything moves.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nUnderstand that in 1964, plate tectonics was still just a theory, kind of a radical one. It was hard for people to accept that the continents we stand on are actually in motion, that we’re just sliding around randomly on violently colliding plates of rock, and that nothing is stable, that everything runs on pure chance. That’s what this story is about, really. Chance. Maybe that’s obvious, it’s even the woman’s last name. But the question is how are we supposed to live on the surface of such unbearable randomness? What can we grab hold of that’s fixed? But when I hear the old recordings of Genie on the radio that weekend and all the other voices working too, I picture them as solid objects, like wires crossing the city of Anchorage, then the state of Alaska further out, crossing each other too, like a net.

The message says your family has been contacted and everything is okay. I’ve been so involved trying to assist down here in the coordination of domestic service at the civil defense headquarters that I really hadn’t stopped to think how worried and concerned my parents must be. I understand that KFAR in Fairbanks is monitoring us and is relaying messages to the South 48. I wonder if the person in KFAR would take down a message from me and get the word to my family in Bonham, Texas that the Chance family is all right. The Chance family is all right. All five of us are safe, none of us received a scratch.”', '6. WHAT IS SAFETY, ANYWAY?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nLate on Saturday, the day after the quake, Genie read a list of the missing and dead on the air. No one told her to do it, but there didn’t seem to be anyone to ask for permission either. And the next day was Easter Sunday. Ministers talked about death and resurrection. The staff of the Anchorage Daily Times picked up all the pieces of movable type thrown all over their printing room, managed to put out a newspaper. Two JC Penney executives declared-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“We will build again, bigger and better than before.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd eventually, the little theater resumed its production of “Our Town” too. One of the actors told me that after the quake, whenever a restaurant in Anchorage reopened or a church held a mass, there was never an empty seat, she said. Everyone wanted to be with someone else, and there was something especially poetic about the sold-out crowd at the theater that first night because that kind of togetherness is basically what Thornton Wilder’s play is about. It’s a play about daily life in a small town – the deaths and marriages, tragedies, births – and how under all that flux, there’s stability to every community over time. In Anchorage, a city that worried it was temporary, realized it was temporary. At least all its buildings and houses and roads. But it was discovering there was something permanent about itself too. All night at the theater, the character of the stage manager talked to the audience directly narrating the story of the play, kind of like I’ve been doing tonight. Now when the curtain rose on the final acts, he came out for his monologue and told them-', 'VOICEOVER (ROMAN MARS):', '\\n“Now there are some things we all know, but we don’t take them out and look at them very often. We all know that something is eternal and it ain’t houses, and it ain’t names, and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even stars. Everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal and that something has to do with human beings. All the greatest people ever lived have been telling us that for 5,000 years, and yet you’d be surprised how people are always losing hold of it.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nIn the end, Genie chance stayed on duty at KENI for 59 hours that weekend. When things finally calmed down, she sat down to write a letter to her parents in Texas. They’d written to her right after the quake, pleading with Genie to send her three kids to live with them while that battered city up in Alaska and figured out what’s next. “Think of the kids’ safety,” they said. And part of Genie thought it was a good idea, but then she had another more convincing thought.', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“We must be together. As long as we are together, we are confident of the future.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nShe explained to her parents-', 'GENIE CHANCE:', '\\n“That Good Friday night, I knew we had survived miraculously and for this reason, there must be a purpose to our lives. Apparently the children must sense this too, for they have remained calm. They have been fully aware of the emergency but have not feared. We are proud that they are such dependable, responsible youngsters. I would not undermine their confidence in the future, in themselves, by sending them away for their safety. What is safety anyway? How can you predict where or when tragedy will occur? You can only learn to live with it and make the best of it when it happens. These children are not afraid. Their father and I are not afraid. Please don’t you fear for us.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nWhat is safety, anyway? Genie seemed to be conceding that there is only randomness, only chance, and if everything beyond us is chance, maybe the only force we have to survive a world like that is connection. By then, it must’ve seemed so obvious to her. It’s a good idea to hold on to each other.

Thank you.', '————————————', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nThis story was recorded live at the Moore Theater in Seattle in 2017. More about Genie Chance and Jon Mooallem’s new book “This is Chance!” after this.', '[BREAK]', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nJon Mooallem expanded the story you just heard into a beautiful and important new book called “This is Chance!” and I had a conversation with him several days ago, right about the time the reality of the pandemic was just hitting a lot of people. And I started off by asking him how he first learned about Genie Chance.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBasically, I had first learned about a tsunami in Crescent City, California. This was 20 years ago, I learned about this tsunami in 1964 that wiped out this town of Crescent City, California. And I just sort of learned about that in a roundabout way at a diner in Crescent City one day when I saw these historical photos about it. And there’s just some really interesting things about this story, about sort of the resilience of a community that stuck with me. And it wasn’t until many, many years later, until about 2013 or 2014 that I thought to Google it, basically. And I was, “Oh yeah, what caused the tsunami?” and what caused the tsunami was this massive quake in Alaska. And it was a pretty short amount of time between starting to get curious about the earthquake and stumbling on Genie, basically because Genie had produced a lot of material about the quake afterwards, and just interviewed a lot of people and compiled these almost oral history documents, and even like co-authored a scientific paper with the USGS about it.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo her name was out there, but even then it was still just a few more years. Even though I had reached out to her daughter, which became just the most important connection that made this book possible. It still took me a few years even to get up to Jan, who’s her daughter’s house, and look at all of the material that Genie had left behind, which was just 30 something boxes of everything from her life. And at that point, it was just, “Oh my God.” There was just such an opportunity to reconstruct these three days in Anchorage. I mean the book really just tells the story of these three days. And yeah, I just- I couldn’t, I didn’t feel like I could see that opportunity and not do it because it was really almost a now or never thing. Who else is going to be in this basement ever again, right?', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nSo the first incarnation was the live story-song that you made for 99% Invisible, and so did you always have a book in mind? How did it expand? How did that work in your mind?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nYeah. Well, the great thing about doing that project could you guys, was that it gave me the time and sort of the motivation to just see if it was a book. I definitely had that in mind. I was hoping that that’s what it could become. But it’s such a weird process of just cobbling together these material documents from archives, various places, so, but pretty… definitely by the time we were done with that project and we were starting to do the performances, it was very clear to me that this was kind of just the beginning.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd yeah, it was just this process of discovering all these other characters and all these nuances to the story, and just learning more about Anchorage at the time and just this fuller sense, almost like a more empathetic sense too, of what was happening there, both after the quake, but also just what it was like to be living in Alaska in 1964. And then also just finding more and more material, both Genie’s documents and then this huge trove of documents from these sociologists that came to Anchorage to interview everyone about the quake and study the community’s response. They interviewed almost 500 people. I had access to all of their transcripts that were these meticulous blow-by-blow accounts of, “Tell me everything that happened.”', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nRight.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo, yeah, they’re just, as I gathered more of that, I saw all of these other threads just spooling out of what I had already known.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nAnd so, specifically, that group from Ohio that went to study it – this story of the Anchorage earthquake – it’s really interesting to be talking about it right now when people are figuring out ways to deal with a crisis as it unfolds and after it happens. How did the research and writing of this story change the way you view of how people act in a crisis?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nI mean I think it’s a very bizarre experience to have spent almost six or seven years with all of this in my head to various degrees. And then, now at the same time, the book is being, materializing as a real object in the world, to just have the world be, kind of collapsing around it. But yeah, I don’t… I wish I had some very pithy moral that I could draw from all this and just dispense to everyone, and in some sense, I think it’s there, but I’m still struggling to articulate it.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBasically these social scientists, they came to Anchorage thinking that, they were funded by the military, they were thinking that they’re just here to watch a community fall apart and tell, as a sort of simulation of nuclear war, so we can figure out how to control that kind of chaos. And what they found was just really what we were talking about in that, and the piece is just this cooperation and this altruism that just surged up from the community, this impulse that everyone had to just solve problems and cooperate and just get stuff done. And I think we’re definitely, we’re feeling that same thing now, I think it’s just way more opaque as to what we’re supposed to do with that energy.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nRight.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd it’s something that I’ve been turning it just over and over in my mind, and I think it’s just a… the problem is just that it’s… the danger is just not right in front of us the way that it is with an earthquake, and I think it’s sort of scrambles your brain in that way. But I do think that I have this piece in the ‘New York Times,’ that’s sort of an excerpt of the book, where I’m just making the point that I do think we need to kind of understand these things we’re being told to do, like wash our hands and keep our distance, and all of these things that seem like sacrifices or retreats, and just try to understand them as a way to channel that same energy, that these are things we’re doing together, this is a project that we’re doing together, even if we’re actually not supposed to be physically together while we’re doing them.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nMm-hmm. (Affirmative)', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBut it’s that same thing, and it’s not… nothing I’m saying would be new or revelatory to any of the sociologists that study this, because that field of sociology has gone on in all the years since the quake. And it’s really on firm ground that this is just a phenomenon and this is just the way humanity deals with disasters, in this collaborative, improvised, productive way. But yeah, it’s strange to just think about the similarities but also the differences.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nI mean, that essential truth is really contradictory to what we tend to tell stories about in fiction. We tend to tell stories about the pressure cooker of disaster leading to society breaking down. Have you thought about why there’s that impulse to tell those stories when the reality is not that way and maybe more interesting because of it?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nYeah, I mean, I think it’s not just in fiction, I think we tell that story about real life too, right? Sometimes to our detriment. It’s dangerous because if you are in the aftermath of a disaster and you’re looking at everyone around you as barbaric or potentially their whole drive is to harm you and steal what you have, you’re going to address the world very differently than if you walk in with an assumption that people can be trusted and that we’re allies. But yeah, I don’t… I think in some ways there might just be something on a gut level that we’re afraid of, and so we assume it to be true. But it’s really hard to let go of those myths. I mean, even one thing that I just found so entertaining was when you read enough of these case studies or even just press accounts of disasters, and you have, and it was true in Alaska too, is that “Well, we pulled together cause we’re Alaskans.” Right? You had so many Alaskans saying that.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd you had the sociologist who just had to kind of push back and say, “Well, everyone did.” Even the fact that they found themselves exceptional turned out to be unexceptional, because after Katrina it was New Orleanians, “Well, we’re just New Orleanians,” or New Yorkers after 9/11, “Well, we’re new Yorkers.” And just no one can get their head around the fact that, well it’s true for everyone else, “Everyone else is going to collapse and turn into heathens but we’re the one place that has our [beep] together.” So, I found that very amusing. I don’t know, I guess it’s just really hard to register. And even me, I’m not trying to… I mean, even now, I know these things, I’ve written about them, I’m out here saying them in public, but I have to kind of reassure myself that they’re true. And I also think that frankly, I’m talking to you from Washington state, right, where everything feels just probably a little bit more intense.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nYeah, yeah.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBut I think I’ve also just made the decision for myself that, I’m just going to act like they’re true and I’ll be proven wrong. And I would prefer to live in a world where I see that, the possibility of that cooperation and the possibility of that goodness, rather than just always being on guard for the opposite.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nYeah. One of the things that we get the privilege of in the audio piece that we performed on stage versus the book, is you get to hear some of these voices at the end. And I remember doing it on stage and nearly crying every time that moment happens. And what was it like hearing those for the first time when you were going through archives?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nOh, it was unreal. I mean, especially certain moments, I mean, I had so many written documents, right? I had so many interviews and letters, and you get this sense of real life, but it’s almost kept at a distance from you, there’s that buffer. And then when you hear the voices, it shatters that, right? I mean, not completely, right? There’s still-', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nRight, right.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\n… the tapes are fuzzy and they’ve kind of, some of the men especially, seem to have that kind of old-timey cadence. But yeah, there’s something about it. There’s just something about hearing people speak and hearing the confusion in their voices, but also hearing the energy they’re putting into fighting back that confusion, that I just find so moving and so noble. So, yeah, and on top of that, I had all these recordings of just ordinary radio broadcast in Anchorage where Genie kind of making audio diaries of things. And yeah, you can just sort of feel yourself being sucked through time in a way.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative). In this story we are witness to a little sliver of Genie’s life. She went on to do lots of interesting things afterward, can you tell a little bit about what her life was like after the quake?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nYeah, I mean it was a real kind of catapult for her. The first thing that happened was she got super depressed and stressed out I think, just covering the months and months of boring recovery work and infighting, and all the stuff that followed this sort of period of great cooperation as soon as the government agencies got involved in figuring out all the technical stuff. But yeah, she actually left her job at the station shortly after because they wouldn’t give her a raise, and because she was a woman essentially, and she felt kind of indignant about that, rightfully. And she went off on her own, she became kind of a woman about town, like a publicity consultant, just kind of hustling and doing all kinds of freelance work.', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd that eventually led to people started asking her to run for office, and so she became a state legislator in Alaska in, I believe 1971. And was there for many years and just did a whole bunch of stuff there with the kind of same, even a greater a spirit of just, “Who gives a damn, I’m going to do the right thing,” kind of attitude. Which didn’t necessarily make her a favorite among some of her, especially the kind of older male colleagues who looked at their positions in legislator as a sort of a treat that they were entitled to after long careers in business.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nBut the other thing that happened too is that she was in a very bad marriage. Her husband, at the same time that he could be very loving and they were a very happy family, he was also an alcoholic and he was abusive toward her very, very violently. And she never really addressed it, but it seems clear, both reading the stuff that you wrote and talking to people that were around her, was that from the earthquake on there was really this process of her just kind of trusting in her own strength, I guess would be a way to put it. Or just kind of feeling more confident about making decisions in her life, and that led to her leaving her husband and eventually remarrying too. So yeah, I really had no idea about any of that until much later in the process. But yeah, it turned out she was… I guess it makes sense that if you find a sort of remarkable person doing extraordinary things on one weekend that you’ll probably find the rest of their life pretty fascinating too.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\nYeah. Some of her relatives came down to see it when we performed in Seattle. What was that like?', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nOh, it was amazing. I couldn’t, I completely… Yes, so her daughter, Jan, and her husband were there and then two of Jan’s children, and I believe a niece or a cousin or somebody, they came both from Alaska, and then there were some folks that were living in Texas. And yeah, there’s a whole kind of half row of them at the performance, which was just so wonderful because I really never had this experience working on anything before, where so many people that I called just told me outright, “Oh, I’ve been waiting for someone to call me because they’re writing about this.” Often just about the quake, but several people about Genie herself, like “Oh yeah, I’ve been waiting all my life for someone to call me and ask me about Genie Chance.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nAnd I think that her family, her daughter definitely felt that too. I think her daughter just knew what an extraordinary person her mom was, and that’s why she was holding on to all her things all these years and didn’t just toss them. And the other cool thing too was I’d be in their basement just looking through all this stuff, I would stay with them and go up for a few days at a time. And I remember one night being just up really late, just going through box after box, and Jan’s daughter’s, so Genie’s granddaughter who was living in an apartment next to their house at the time, came home from being out with her husband at a bar or something. And we got to chatting and I was, at one point I said, “So, what did you really know about your grandmother?” Because she was pretty young when Genie died. She said, “To be honest, I didn’t really know much about her until you started poking around and we started talking about it again.”', 'JON MOOALLEM:', '\\nSo, yeah, I don’t know, there’s just something, maybe it’s a middle-age thing, like a mid-life… now that I’m 40, in my 40’s, but there was just something really potent and moving about just kind of seeing the way people’s memories can kind of catapult through time and the impacts that they have, and yeah. And to also just recognize that yes, Genie’s fascinating and did amazing stuff, but how many other lives out there could you just, if you found this way into would deliver that? Just that same kind of rush, that recognition of just another human.', 'ROMAN MARS:', '\\n“This is Chance!

I’m Roman Mars.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBack in the 1960s and 70s, in the city of Pittsburgh, there was a nickname for guys like John Moon — “the unemployables.”', 'John Moon:', '\\nWhich simply meant that no matter where you went for a job, nobody would hire you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMoon grew up in Pittsburgh’s largely black and economically depressed Hill District. In better times, the Hill had its own Negro League baseball team and jazz clubs that hosted Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. But by the time Moon was graduating high school in the late 1960s, there was no escaping the neighborhood’s “unemployable” stigma.', 'John Moon:', '\\nThe reputation was there. The “I don’t want to go to the Hill” because you may get beat up. You have drug addicts and alcoholics. And that same label was placed on myself and I understood that but just because that was your thought doesn’t necessarily mean I had to live up to it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Moon was glad to land a well-paying job right out of school at the local steel mill, only to discover that the hours weren’t as reliable as he had hoped. Next, he was an orderly at Pittsburgh’s Presbyterian-University Hospital, which provided steady employment, but not much else.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAll I was doing was making beds and taking people back and forth to the operating room and lifting and stuff like that, mechanical things where you didn’t have to think.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor a while, Moon tried his best to find meaning in the work.', 'John Moon:', '\\nBut there was a part of me that said, there has to be something more that I can do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThen one night, halfway through the graveyard shift, Moon watched as two men burst through the doors of the hospital. They were working desperately to save a dying patient. And as they rushed by, Moon stood pressed against the wall and wondered-', 'John Moon:', '\\nWho are these people? What are they doing? How did they get to be able to do that?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMaybe today he wouldn’t bat an eye at this scene, but in 1970, nothing about it made sense. The two men weren’t doctors and they weren’t nurses. And their strange white uniforms weren’t hospital issue.', 'John Moon:', '\\nBut these guys came in with a certain type of confidence that was just shocking to me from the very point that they came into the room. And they had an emblem on their breast that just piqued my interest.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe emblem was the two-snaked Caduceus, the traditional sign of medicine and healing. But just below the familiar symbol was a word John Moon had never seen before — paramedic.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon wasn’t familiar with the term “paramedic,” because, back then, no one was.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s reporter Kevin Hazzard.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon was witnessing the birth of a new profession. One that would go on to change the face of emergency medicine.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut to Moon, perhaps the most striking thing of all was that these first-ever paramedics looked like him.', 'John Moon:', '\\nI’m standing here looking at these two guys and I’m saying to myself, “My God, these are black guys.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nNever before had Moon seen young African-American men performing that kind of work.', 'John Moon:', '\\nThese were two guys that had afros and beards. And the staff on the floor gave them a level of respect that amazed me. And there’s something I never really mentioned to anyone is I actually snuck off of the floor and I actually followed them out to the vehicle because I wanted to see what prompted them to show such proudness and boldness. And once I looked at that vehicle pull off, it was almost like there goes my job, there goes my career. That’s what I want to do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMoon vowed right then, halfway through his long night shift, to become a paramedic… whatever that was.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nAnd in Pittsburgh in 1970, the only place to do that was an organization called Freedom House Ambulance Service.', 'John Moon:', '\\nSo I went and applied to get a job with them. And the rest is history', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut that history — about how a group of young black men from Pittsburgh became the world’s first paramedics — is still largely unknown.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nI’m a former paramedic myself. I did this job for ten years. And you’d think the profession’s origin story would be a big deal. But the truth is, most of the EMTs I’ve talked to have never heard of the Freedom House paramedics — or understand what we owe them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nToday, it’s easy to take what paramedics do for granted. Call 911 and they’ll arrive with cardiac monitors, airway equipment, and an array of pharmaceuticals to treat anything from heart attacks to gunshots to premature births.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut for a long time, emergency medical service, or what today is called EMS, didn’t provide anything resembling that.', 'Richard Clinchy:', '\\nIn the early days of what we would view as EMS, it really wasn’t the equivalent of what we see today. They would do whatever it was they knew to do. But, you know, were they doing the right thing? Who knows?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nRichard Clinchy is the president of the EMS museum and a trained paramedic. Clinchy says that when he started in emergency care in the late 50s, emergency services didn’t provide treatment at the scene or even necessarily on the way to the hospital. They were just about getting you to the hospital as quickly as possible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich kind of makes sense in a way. It is, after all, where the doctors are.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut, as a result, it often wasn’t clear whose responsibility it was to rush to the scene of an accident.', 'Richard Clinchy:', '\\nBefore the evolution of EMS, who did you call? Well, I was a paid firefighter back in the 60s and sometimes we got the call. If somebody needed a fire truck in the city, in New York there were fireboxes everywhere. You’d pull the handle and fire personnel and fire equipment would show up.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nIn other areas, the responsibility for transporting patients often fell to local funeral homes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nImagine that. You’re having a massive heart attack, your life’s in the balance. And who rolls up to save you? Two morticians in a hearse.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut in many major cities, this crucial task fell to another municipal service that probably had even less business responding to medical emergencies — the police.', 'Richard Clinchy:', '\\nIn the area where I was a firefighter, we had a police department that had a 57 Chevrolet wagon. That was an emergency response vehicle.', 'John Moon:', '\\nSo the idea the general public was faced with was more or less what I would call “swoop and scoop,” which simply meant that you’d call the police, they’d rush the person out there to you, and they’d pick you up, put you in the back and rush you down to the hospital.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nWith minimal training and equipment, John Moon says police departments could do little more than offer patients basic first-aid, a canvas stretcher, a half-empty oxygen tank, and a pillow.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich, more often than not, only served to choke off the patient’s airway.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd on top of that, both individuals – meaning police officers – got up front. And left you back there by yourself. So if you stop breathing, by the time you arrived, you were perhaps D.O.A. because no one had done anything for you.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThe police simply didn’t have the tools, the training or the disposition to save people in a medical emergency, but in the absence of a dedicated emergency medical service, the job was being left to them by default.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd perhaps nowhere was the problem of relying on the police for help more vividly illustrated than in Pittsburgh’s largely black Hill District.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon says the city’s mostly white police force was often slow to respond to emergencies in the Hill. While the black residents, for their part, were reluctant to even call the police to begin with.', 'John Moon:', '\\nBecause there was a trust issue with the police, primarily because there were no constraints. They could do whatever they wanted and there was no repercussion or consequences for their actions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo one wanted to get into the exact same police van that the cops had threatened to throw them in the day before.', 'John Moon:', '\\nSo there was issues all the way around. Do I really want to call the police? Chances are they’re going to take their time getting here, number one, and if I wait too long, then chances are a cab won’t come to my neighborhood primarily because of fear of being robbed or whatever the case is. So the options were very limited during that time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the same was true to varying degrees in the rest of the country. Whether a neighborhood was served by the police or the fire department or the local funeral home, so long as the priority was transportation as opposed to treatment, no one even realized there was a “job” that needed doing.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut then, in the mid-60s, something happened which flipped the paradigm for emergency care on its head — and laid the groundwork for the invention of paramedicine.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1966, the federal government published a white paper that would prove so influential that even now in EMS circles it is simply called the “White Paper.”', 'Richard Clinchy:', '\\nBasically, it told us we were killing over fifty thousand people a year on the highways and doing so unnecessarily, that there was a way to intervene and save those people. But we didn’t have the people, nor the resources, nor the training to do a whole lot about it.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nTechniques practiced by combat medics overseas had been largely ignored by the medical community, with the result that a person was more likely to die of a gunshot wound in America than on a battlefield in Vietnam.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe “White Paper” shamed the government into providing money for EMS development on the local level. And government officials and local community leaders began searching for solutions, including a community organizer in Pittsburgh named Phil Hallen.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Oh, my God. Why do I do this?”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHallen is a former ambulance attendant who came to Pittsburgh in the early 60s and yes, he hates being interviewed.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Okay, how long are we going to be going on this? I don’t last very long at age 90.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHallen ran a civil rights organization called the Maurice Falk Medical Fund, which examined health disparities due to institutional racism, and he immediately focused his ire on the city’s pitiful emergency services.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\n“What was your impression of the level of care that was available in Pittsburgh?”', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Well, it wasn’t my impression of it. It was the way it was, you know. There wasn’t any level of care. There was no such thing as emergency medicine or any of the things we now look back on and think what the hell was going on? There was nothing. I mean, nobody was trained. Especially the cops.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHe could see that what was going on was effectively a public health crisis that was disproportionately affecting black neighborhoods.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut then one day, Hallen came across an article in the local paper about a black-operated jobs training program based in the Hill District called Freedom House.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThe article described how Freedom House had rolled out a kind of mobile grocery store for black neighborhoods, using trucks to bring fresh vegetables to people’s doors.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Well, health care is terrible in the Hill District. You have to do something. If they can run a grocery van around, why can’t we run a medical van around or something like that?”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHallen wasn’t envisioning anything like modern emergency medical services. At first, he just thought Freedom House’s trucks could help transport people in underserved neighborhoods to the hospital, and that they could hire people from the Hill District to drive them.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“But that’s when I got the director of the University Hospital on this group as well. And, you know, before the first meeting was over, he said, ‘Oh, my God. We have to go immediately to Saffer.’”', '[PETER SAFAR: THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS ONE OF EIGHTEEN SIMILAR STUDIES DURING WHICH WE COMPARED VARIOUS METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.]', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nDr. Peter Safar was the head of anesthesiology at the University of Pittsburgh, and by that time, he was already famous in medical circles.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Safar was a pure scientist and a very precise and impatient Austrian.”', '[PETER SAFAR: WE SIMULATED FIELD CONDITIONS BY SELECTING, AS SUBJECTS, MEN AND WOMEN OF VARIOUS BODY TYPES.]', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThis is a film of Safar from 1951, demonstrating a new technique he developed for resuscitation – what today we call CPR.', '[PETER SAFAR: TO HELP ORIENT YOU, WE HAVE MADE A DIAGRAM OF THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP.]', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nSafar understood that to be effective, resuscitation needed to be started immediately by the first person on the scene.

And when I say untrained laypeople, I mean children.', '[PETER SAFAR: THIS BOY SCOUT WILL PERFORM MOUTH-TO-AIRWAY BREATHING.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nUltimately, Safar’s views would be vindicated, and for his effort, he’d forever be known as the “father of CPR.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHallen already knew some of this when he walked into Peter Safar’s office in 1966, but nothing could have prepared him for what actually happened.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWithin seconds of greeting Hallen and the Freedom House team, the wiry and energetic Safar began to unleash a torrent of ideas.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Basically he said, ‘You are just what I’m looking for. I’ve been trying to figure out how to take rescue breathing and the rest out on the street and to train people how to do that. You’ve got the people.’”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut Safar didn’t stop there. He wasn’t content to just teach some van drivers CPR.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“He said, ‘Let’s go beyond that. Let’s train them to be professionals as well. ‘“', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nProfessionals who could provide high-quality medical care before the person was even taken to the hospital.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“It was not ‘go to the scene, pick up a patient, transport to a hospital, and then start care.’ It was emergency treatment right there on the pavement.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nInstead of repurposed cargo spaces, Safar argued that ambulances should be mobile intensive-care units staffed by professionals trained to use cardiac monitors, administer medication, and anything else that might keep a patient alive.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nHallen and the others could barely keep up. Safar wasn’t proposing a simple update to the existing system, but to change the whole culture of pre-hospital care. And he wanted to do it using Freedom House.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“I think somebody said, ‘Well, how big? What are we talking about here?’ He said, ‘I could teach….’ I can remember this. ‘I can instruct 40 people.’ And, you know, and inside of a half an hour, we realized that there was something going on here which was way beyond anything that we had thought of.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nSafar set about designing advanced ambulances and an intense 300-hour course, whose graduates would be the world’s first comprehensively trained first responders. This wasn’t just the birth of a profession, but of a whole new branch of medicine. It would become a vital link in the chain, with a subculture all its own.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the world’s first fully-trained paramedics would be staffed exclusively with young black men from the Hill District of Pittsburgh.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd the people that worked there, all were labeled “unemployable.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFreedom House recruited many of its first students right off the street, most of whom were just happy to land a good job, even if they were a little fuzzy on the details.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nJohn Moon wasn’t part of that first class. He signed up a little later. But even he admits that as incredible as he thought the opportunity was, he didn’t fully understand what he was getting into.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOn some level, he was just excited to finally be wearing the uniform with the cool emblem he saw on that first night.', 'John Moon:', '\\nI’ll put it this way, if someone bought you a thousand-dollar suit and just gave it to you and said just walk up and down the street in it, how would you feel? That’s the way I felt. I was at the point where, okay, I got this uniform, that’s all it takes to help people. And boy, was I wrong. It took a little bit more than that.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nAfter they signed up, Moon and the others underwent a battery of psychological evaluations and interviews with medical professionals. They learned anatomy, physiology, CPR, advanced first aid, nursing, and defensive driving.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt first under Safar, but later under Freedom House’s first medical director — a 30-year-old white doctor with no previous ambulance experience named Nancy Caroline.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd we looked at her with skepticism because, you have to remember, she’s not black. But once we found out that her heart was with us, that was really nothing she could do wrong. And everywhere she went, she took us with her.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nCaroline got the trainees access to almost every department of the hospital. She had them work in the morgue, the anesthesiology suite, and the maternity ward.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd, of course, if they were going to bring the ICU to the street, they had to master everything that happened in an ICU.', 'John Moon:', '\\nSo that included spinal immobilization, cervical immobilization, IV insertion. And the advantages of classroom training for us, at that particular time, is we would learn a procedure in class, or she would teach it to us, and then we would go out a half-hour, 45 minutes later after we got a class and perform that procedure on a person.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd Freedom House paramedics were often the first people to perform that procedure outside of a hospital.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThey were among the first to use Narcan to reverse an overdose, and the first to save a patient by shocking their heart in the field. Moon told me that the biggest first he personally experienced came on a call where Nancy Caroline was riding along.', 'John Moon:', '\\nIt was a patient having trouble breathing. He was unconscious.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nSo Moon started calling it in. But then Nancy Caroline stopped him.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd lo and behold, she said, “Start an I.V. and intubate this patient.” And I said, “Repeat that?” She says, “Start an I.V. and intubate this patient.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon thinks he was the first paramedic who was ever asked to intubate someone in the field. I wasn’t able to confirm that, but intubation — the subtle but critical art of snaking a breathing tube into a patient’s trachea — is an incredibly difficult procedure. I’ve gone through the training. It’s not easy, even in a hospital setting. And here they were doing it on the sidewalk. Moon says he was scared to death.', 'John Moon:', '\\nOnce I gathered my nerves together. And remembered how she had taught us in the anatomy lab, I went on and did it. And once intubated the person and I took him to the emergency room, I had to deal with the ER doctor saying, “Well, who intubated this person? Who caused him to be intubated?” And I said, “I did.” “And you are?” I said, “Well, my name is John Moon. I’m a paramedic at Freedom House ambulance service.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it wasn’t enough for Moon and the other paramedics to simply master the techniques required for emergency medical care. Freedom House personnel faced an even bigger challenge from the moment they got a call.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThe city had contracted with Freedom House to handle calls in Pittsburgh’s mostly black neighborhoods and the downtown area, but the Pittsburgh police dispatchers often refused to send them.', 'John Moon:', '\\nBecause the police looked at us as someone taking their jobs away. Freedom House looked at the police as being a threat to the patient. And one of the things that we had to put in place is we used a police scanner and we would monitor the calls. And we would subsequently try to get to the scene before they did.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon recalls getting to the scene just seconds after the police arrived and seeing them try to drag patients out of wrecked cars.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd here we are saying, “No you can’t do this. Let’s put him on a spine board and put a cervical collar on them.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBut remember these were a bunch of black guys from the Hill lecturing mostly white cops.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd we’re yelling at them and they’re cussing us out.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nSometimes the police would relent, but other times they would threaten the paramedics with arrest unless they backed off.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd, you know, the only thing you can do is just stand back and say, okay. And then you watch them, drag the individual out of the car, and put him in the back of a paddy wagon. And both guys get up front and they race off to a hospital. So those were oftentimes battles that you were not going to win.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nAnd it wasn’t just the cops who didn’t understand. Patients couldn’t fathom why Moon was using a cardiac monitor and starting IVs in their house instead of hurrying them to a doctor.', 'John Moon:', '\\nTheir idea was “let’s call the ambulance, the ambulance comes to pick you up and take you to the hospital.” That’s all they knew. And it wasn’t the easiest thing in the world to explain to a family member that we have brought the emergency room to the person.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTrying to convince white patients to submit to treatment was especially difficult. Some wouldn’t even let the Black paramedics touch them.', 'John Moon:', '\\nThat was frowned upon on more than one occasion where they would say, “No. Do you have to really do this? I would prefer that you not do it.” It’s something that we had to endure because the problem was not with us. The problem was with the patient. It was their belief or their preconceived notion about the individuals that were touching them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe same went for doctors and nurses at any hospital not directly affiliated with Safar and the Freedom House program.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nMoon remembers trying to read a patient’s vital signs only to have a nurse laugh in his face, as if he was pretending to play doctor. Other Freedom House paramedics were mistaken for orderlies and asked to mop the floor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut despite all the struggle, Freedom House’s reputation was growing.', 'John Moon:', '\\nPeople were beginning to recognize that something really different was going on here. This wasn’t just “call the ambulance.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nPhil Hallen says stories started to spread about an ambulance service that could perform miraculous life-saving procedures at the scene of horrific accidents.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPerhaps the most influential story was about a kid on his bike who was hit head-on by a car. The accident was in Squirrel Hill, one of the city’s most affluent neighborhoods, and one that Freedom House had never been allowed to enter.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nSo initially the dispatcher sent the police. But the cops panicked. The kid was bleeding out in front of them and they had no idea what to do.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Somebody said, ‘Get Freedom House up here.’ And they did a miraculous activity which nobody had ever seen happen, take place on the street before. People watched it happen. And that was a major turning point.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy this time, Freedom House’s five ambulances were running nearly 6,000 calls a year. And providing demonstrably better care. At a city council meeting, Safar presented data showing that as many as 1,200 people a year had been dying needlessly while in the care of other emergency services. Freedom House paramedics, by contrast, had saved 200 lives in the first year alone.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nDoctors and medical directors from around the country flocked to Pittsburgh. Freedom House medics were invited to conferences as far away as Germany. Everyone wanted to see what they were doing and learn how they could copy it. And in 1975, the federal government chose Freedom House to field test the first standardized training curriculum for EMS providers. And Nancy Caroline was asked to write the textbook.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Freedom House’s growing reputation would ultimately prove to be its greatest liability.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThe more successes they chalked up, the more certain residents and city officials wanted to see Freedom House gone. And according to John Moon, it was for a simple reason.', 'John Moon:', '\\nHow dare you have an EMS system or an ambulance service this good serving the black economically deprived community – or as society says, “those people” – and we don’t have anything like that?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd perhaps no one did more to punish Freedom House for this transgression than Pittsburgh’s mayor.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nElected in 1969, 45-year-old Pete Flaherty was a fiscally conservative democrat. Tall and broad-shouldered, he went into office already believing programs using taxpayer money should be managed entirely by the city. But ask Phil Hallen, and he’ll tell you that the mayor’s beef with Freedom House went beyond issues of fiscal or bureaucratic turf.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\n“What was his opinion of Freedom House?”', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Well, he didn’t like it particularly, because it was doing too well and I was black.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\n“You think that’s why he felt that way?”', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“I think so.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\n“Did… was it your opinion that he was racist?”', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Yes.”', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nWhen Flaherty took office, he slashed Freedom House’s operating budget in half. This didn’t leave enough money to cover even routine maintenance on the ambulances. Caroline repeatedly wrote frustrated missives to Freedom House’s board, complaining about brakes and steering that locked up, doors that fell from the hinges, and seats that toppled over. Once, according to Caroline, an engine caught fire while transporting a patient.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFlaherty passed an ordinance that banned ambulances from using their sirens in certain neighborhoods which significantly slowing their response times.', 'John Moon:', '\\nAnd at first, they’ll say you can’t use your siren downtown because people are complaining about it. Unfortunately, people look in the vehicle to see who’s driving it and then they complain. So you’re going to a call downtown, you have to blow your horn to tell a car to get out of the way. And they’re looking at you like you’re crazy!', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRumors were spread that Freedom House paramedics were selling drugs and running dice games from the ambulances and that thousands of dollars had been stolen from headquarters.', 'John Moon:', '\\nIt became a struggle after struggle after struggle and eventually, you know, it’s almost like a patient struggling to breathe, and eventually, the heart gets tired and it stops beating and the person stops breathing and that’s exactly what happened.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nIn 1975, Flattery struck a final devastating blow. He announced that the city would roll out its own brand new paramedic service.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNot only was the new service showered with the resources Freedom House had long been denied, its recruits were all white.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThe city needed Caroline to serve as its medical director and she used that leverage to make one demand—that the Freedom House crews be hired on. Flaherty relented. Sort of.', 'John Moon:', '\\nBecause the city was required to bring the employees over but they were not required to keep them. So they found a way to get rid of ‘em. So, you know, that’s how the city’s system ended up being 98% white when the first EMS system in this country was African-American.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nWithin a few years of being replaced by the city’s EMS service, Freedom House was more or less forgotten. In part because, like all good things, paramedics were soon taken for granted. Today, it never occurs to anyone to ask where paramedicine came from.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut to Phil Hallen, that’s the true measure of Freedom House’s legacy. Paramedicine is just there.', 'Phil Hallen:', '\\n“Do you know anybody that doesn’t take this for granted at this point in any American city or even in the American countryside? I mean, nobody would even think of a time when somebody would not survive because somebody didn’t know how to do CPR. It’s unthinkable anywhere in the United States.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe model of care created at Freedom House ended up being adopted by countless other paramedics programs across the country, very often with the help of Freedom House veterans. Peter Safar helped to develop a paramedic program in Baltimore. Mitchell Brown, another Freedom House alum, became the EMS commissioner for the city of Cleveland and later its director of public safety. And Nancy Caroline founded the first-ever EMS service in Israel. Her textbook, titled “Emergency Care in the Streets,” ended up setting the standard in EMS instruction for decades.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nAs for Moon, he stayed with Pittsburgh EMS and retired in 2009 as an assistant chief. How does he feel about it all now, when he looks back on the days when a handful of young men from the Hill made history?', 'John Moon:', '\\nIt is something I’m extremely, extremely proud to have been a part of and every time I see an EMS unit going down the street, I wonder do they have any idea, that’s where it all began because it all began there.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nKevin and I discuss what lesson the surprisingly recent history of paramedicine might offer people contemplating a different role for police in our public safety infrastructure today, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So I’m now talking with Kevin Hazzard, who reported that story for us. And you are a paramedic. I think that’s interesting to note. How did you get into being a paramedic?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nBasically, after 9/11, I was working as a reporter and, you know, a lot of my friends had been in the military and they had these crazy stories that they would tell. One of them was among the first Marines to enter into Iraq and he’s like cruising along, talking about rockets being fired from a helicopter so close he could feel a heat off of them. And I’m sitting in city council meetings and reporting on whether or not they should put speed bumps in various suburban streets. I was just frustrated and bored. And then one night I got sent by my editor to cover a tunnel collapse. They were doing this huge infrastructure project in Atlanta. And there were six guys on a scaffolding that dropped 250 feet into the earth. We sat outside with the families and waited. And there were a group of paramedics that went down there, sort of high angle rescue team. They rappelled down into the darkness. And we’re all waiting and waiting and waiting. And finally, they emerge. And, you know, of course, the news is as bad as we anticipated it to be. But there was something in those guys in the way that they carried themselves and whatever it was that they saw once they disappeared into darkness of that hole, I just thought, well, whatever version of the truth that I’m looking for, I think those guys are carrying it somewhere within them. So I just signed up for an EMT class completely on a lark. I had no idea if I even could finish it. And next thing you know, I’m sitting on an ambulance and on my way to some ridiculous call. It just all happened somewhat, somewhat accidentally.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, it sounds pretty similar to the story that John Moon says, you know, like of seeing someone, being inspired by that as being a vocation and then speaking to you in some way. Did that story have particular resonance with you because of your own experience?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nYeah, I did. I mean, if you get to the heart of John’s story, you know, really, he’s a young guy who’s looking for a way to prove himself in the world, particular to a world has ignored him. Obviously, my experience in life is vastly different from John’s. But that to me, it was I saw this group of people who were doing something and I thought that I could do. It didn’t feel like an unattainable goal, but it felt like this incredible opportunity to do this sort of thing that I never anticipated to have the opportunity to do and so there was a lot in John’s story that always felt… that rang true to me.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what part of your career did you learn about this history, about the first paramedics being black men from an underserved neighborhood in Pittsburgh and this whole origin story?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nNo part. I think that’s probably the reason that John sits up a night, you know, filing his teeth in his Pittsburgh home. Nobody knows this. When when I went to paramedic school, my instructors were one of the first six medics in the state of Georgia. And he was telling us these stories of the early days when he was riding a hearse, coming out of the funeral homes and they would embalm bodies one night and then transport the next. And, you know, they’d get a call and you sweep the flower petals out of the back of the hearse and you rush off.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo when you see sweeping out petals in the hearse. He was one of those people sent by the funeral home to be an EMS person. Is that is that what you mean?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nYeah. And much of Atlanta, the only people who were capable of transporting a body with a funeral house, right? How many people have something like a hearse? And so he was a funeral home employee. And one night a week he would embalm bodies. And then the next night he would be responsible for responding to emergency calls. And this was before there was any notion of a paramedic. So these guys had maybe 10 hours of first aid training. And they’re sitting down in the basement of the funeral home call comes in. They rush out. Again, they yank out the casket, sweep out the flower petals, slide in some sort of a stretcher, and race the streets in a hearse which is these old Cadillac hearses. And he said that if you get going too fast, the brakes would soften up and you couldn’t stop. So they’re screaming in this hearse with a purple light on its roof, screaming through the city of Atlanta with no brakes, flower petals trailing out of the back window.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, my goodness. That sounds like a totally different world. It’s amazing that that’s within our lifetimes. That’s just amazing.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThat’s not that long ago at all.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, yeah.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nAnd so hearing these stories of the early days when, you know, they carried a credit card machine with them and before they dropped a patient off the hospital, they’d slide it in front of them and say, “Cash, check or charge.” This really sort of Wild West era in which nobody really knew what they were doing. But that was all I knew about it, was that it started out in a very, you know, slipshod sort of way and then slowly became serious. It wasn’t until after my book came out that somebody said to me, “Hey, there’s another story, another EMS story, if you’re ever looking for one.” And it was set in Pittsburgh. So I started Googling it. And the only thing I could find were a handful of local press accounts of these young men and women who had done this thing in the late 60s, early 70s. And I started digging into it. And all of a sudden the reality of what it was that had happened, that nobody knew. I know a paramedic from Pittsburgh who has no idea that this was the start of it all. And for no one to know that it was shocking to me, particularly someone who did it for a year and wrote about it. When I got in touch with John and I said, “How does nobody know this?” And he just screamed, “I know! Nobody knows!”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, I’m so glad that we get to tell the story because it is amazing to me. And it’s pretty resonant today, in particular the role of police in both the story that you told and what’s happening right now. There’s this history there that we presented that is, you know, the police were the kind of default person to be called in this emergency, even though they had no skills or inclination to do the job that was required and we’re looking at what policing means today. And what does it mean that a person potentially armed like a soldier is brought to a situation where someone had a stroke, for example, and maybe that isn’t the right thing to do. And we had this discussion, you know, or we think people had this discussion the late 60s and 70s, too. So when you think about the story you told in your experience, when you think about what the discussions are happening today, how do you take in the moment and reconcile it with this history that we told in this story?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nYeah, you know, what’s crazy about that is when I began researching this story, I was coming across quotes that really got to the heart of a conversation we’re just now having today. And these are things that I was reading in the fall and spring of 2018 and 2019. You know, the early medics who were out there saying, “Hey, you know, if you want this police truck to show up at your house, you have to understand that last night that was a truck that showed up to rest your neighbor and tomorrow night might be the truck to show up to rescue you.” And if you really think people are gonna be comfortable calling that guy to arrive tonight then, I don’t think you understand the situation we’re living in. And there was a lot of pushback from the city of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, about changing this system because it was the system that had always been and people thought, “well, it works,” and somebody was able to come along and prove that, no, this isn’t working. And these guys aren’t suited for this task.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, but I think what is valuable about these lessons of history, it’s so recent that paramedics were invented. It’s so surprisingly recent that it should free your mind to think of the possibilities of what infrastructure, public safety could be today if we didn’t all want it to rest on the police and wanted to try something different.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nI would agree. I understand the resistance to it. I understand the fear that people feel. When you say something like “defund the police,” it sounds like a really radical term. But if you can sit down and realize how often the police are called out because there’s a psych patient who hasn’t taken his medicine and his 76-year-old parents aren’t certain what to do with them, and this police officer shows up and that’s saying to a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Well, you know, unfortunately, the police really kind of… they’re limited in terms of what they can do. And one of the things I learned very quickly in doing that job was that the police can’t lose a fight. By the nature of their profession, their back is against the wall. And once they arrive, they have to keep pushing forward. And oftentimes that led to a situation that didn’t need to happen. You know, what could have been a situation that we had de-escalated, wound up escalating because the person that arrived was someone who had, essentially, if they didn’t get cooperation, they only had one avenue that they could venture down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s amazing to me to think when John Moon saw the paramedics for the first time, he’d never heard the word paramedic. And it was completely novel to most people. And I’m thinking today about how we’re thinking about the police and maybe how to sort of defund them or divest them of some of these activities which they’re not suited towards. I think it’s kind of interesting to imagine that there could be a word, that is like a rapid response social worker, mental health worker that is going to be sent out to people that will be a word like ‘paramedic’ in 50 years. Have you thought about that?', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nIt feels like I have. It feels like we’re on the cusp of that moment. There’s no doubt that people are looking for a new way for police to respond. It’s something different to come out and the number of instances we’ve had in which, you know, these situations have gone wrong. How often it has been someone who’s called out for a mental health issue or something that didn’t initially appear to be a crime in progress. And you have to think that somebody out there in the midst of all these “defund the police” conversations, someone must be saying, “Well, how else can we deploy these resources?” Who else can we bring to bear in these situations that can bring a better outcome? And there’s probably a new job title, a new role, a whole new group of people that are sitting out there that not too long from now, we’re all going to look back and say, well, of course, it’s so obvious. Naturally, those guys are there. Naturally, those people are responding. How on earth did we live without them? And I think we’re sort of at the moment where these things are born.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, I think it’s really interesting. And I am so glad we’re able to share the story. So thanks so much for talking with us and for reporting it. It’s been great.', 'Kevin Hazzard:', '\\nThank you.

It looks at the somewhat bizarre but incredibly powerful marriage between a fast-food behemoth and the fight for civil rights.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nI remember when I was on my book tour, I met a woman who said she remembers going to McDonald’s for the first time and getting ice cream because she had grown up in the “Jim Crow South,” and they never went to an ice cream parlor because there was a “colored only” and “whites only” counter and her grandmother wouldn’t let her go, and so they would make ice cream at home and she remembers going to get ice cream. I think that for people who were so separated from those experiences and from the pleasure of going out and eating and enjoying themselves, having McDonald’s as this accessible place and having advertisement that shows that you are welcome was a really, really big deal, and it still sticks with a lot of people of that generation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMy discussion with Marcia Chatelain starts in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nMcDonald joins the legions of businesses that are trying to find a way to capitalize on this urban crisis moment where there’s destruction on the streets after Martin Luther King’s assassination. Some white franchise owners who are doing business in predominantly Black neighborhoods wanted out. They were concerned about future property damage, other uprisings, and so in vacating their stores, McDonald’s filled those gaps with African-American franchisees who were stepping into business for the first time. Most of us think about “white flight” in the context of housing and the loss of tax revenue for schools. But I think that we also have to think about economic white flight. What does it mean for white business owners to shutter their businesses, move to the suburbs, and to end their main street presence? Then there were these calls for using Black economic power under the umbrella of Black capitalism to rebuild and reimagine Black communities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCan you give me the grand unified theory of Black capitalism? What is it supposed to do? What is it supposed to accomplish?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo Black capitalism is this idea that in the absence of full political and social rights, that if African-Americans develop a strong economic base and economic presence, that this can fill the gaps. And it doesn’t work ever.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSpoiler alert.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nHot take alert folks, it does not work. So McDonald’s is there at the forefront of capitalizing on federal programs that are supposed to support Black business ownership and having this business model that they realize very quickly can actually thrive in the inner city.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. This is all hinged on the idea of the franchise. So could you talk about how franchising and Black capitalism work together?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo franchising, as I described in the book, in Freudian terms, is the idea that a parent company makes all the rules, but the children earn all the money. So the franchise model is so American because it says you don’t need a fancy degree and you don’t need to have a lot of business knowledge, but you have to have the ability to be compliant, follow the rule book, pay your fees, and then you can have your own business. So it’s this idea of the easiest way to become an entrepreneur or business owner. The reality is, is that franchising is predicated on you the franchisee assuming a lot of liability. For the people who are able to access these programs and the funds and the loans, they’re getting to access some of the most iconic brands, some of the most established businesses, and it’s supposed to be the easy way. But because of the dynamics of race in capitalism, it’s never quite that easy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the confusing aspects of franchising is that it is unclear – I mean, at least it’s unclear to me – who actually owns the shop.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nWell, the initial idea of the McDonald’s franchise was that it was a person who owned the store and was there all the time. So in the early days, you would know who your local franchise owner was and that person would be at the (inaudible) club. There a person who’s sponsoring little league, that this was this like very local thing. Then slowly but surely in order for people to really make money in the system, they start owning multiple franchises and their portfolio is filled with fast food outlets. But for African-Americans, again, because of racial wealth gaps, they were less likely to own multiple stores. They’re also likely to do business in predominantly Black areas.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo when I was touring the book, sometimes white audience members would say like, “How am I supposed to know who owns my franchise? That’s kind of weird.” Then every Black person I would see would be like, “Yeah, I totally know the guy who franchised the McDonald’s,” right? Because he’s everywhere. He’s on the radio telling you to vote, telling you to fill out your census. He’s given people jobs at the job fair. This person is such a figure and I think that that’s when it gets super murky because throughout the book, people are wondering if I go to a Black franchised McDonald’s, am I supporting a Black business? To what extent is it really a Black business? It’s actually really hard to answer.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, what is obvious in the exploration of your book is that Black capitalism and some of the responsibilities that McDonald’s would take on were things that the government was failing at. Could you talk a little bit about that? Because a lot of what’s complicated about this relationship is not the failure of McDonald’s to serve the Black community or Black business owners. It’s that they’re forced to serve the community and Black business owners because other structures are failing.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nRight. So like the Black business owner has historically been the unelected official of Black America wherever it is residing, and the franchise owner takes up that role. Initially, when I thought about how would I describe this book in one sentence, it was how McDonald’s are placed to state in Black America, in the sense that the McDonald’s is the place where a senior citizen can hang out with friends. It is the place that is underwriting the cultural and athletic events at the local school. It’s the place where the first job training program happens, and it’s the affiliation of these Black franchise owners into a national organization that’s allowing health screenings to happen in some places.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nA lot of the literature on Black capitalism often frames it as this great failure that like in the ’70s, people had this wild idea that you could do these things and everything failed. But I argue that it was so successful that we don’t even see its markings, that we don’t point to the expansion of fast food as the success of Black capitalism, but that’s exactly what that’s part of.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So Black capitalism was a success in that it created more successful McDonald’s franchises and those places became defacto hubs for the Black community, but it still failed in the broad sense for most African-Americans and that it didn’t come close to making up for being shut out of political power or economic equality. So let’s go back in time when the promise of Black capitalism was still a bit more propitious and McDonald’s was becoming intertwined with Black communities. So in Los Angeles, in the 1970s, McDonald’s had dozens of Black franchise owners, including this man named Charles Griffis, but they ended up in a lawsuit with Griffis. What happened there?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nYeah. So it’s so interesting to hear people talk about African-Americans and franchising because they use a lot of the language that people have come to understand around housing discrimination. So they talk about discrimination in lending, access to capital, and then they talk about redlining and they claim that McDonald’s keeps two sets of lists of potential franchise locations, that whites go to white neighborhoods and Black people are confined to Black neighborhoods. They talk about how if you are Black and you move into a predominantly white territory, the white franchise owners come together to keep you out, and so these allegations are being made throughout the late ’60s and ’70s and ’80s, and Charles Griffis is this franchise owner who’s so ready for prime-time that the great tragedy of his story is that he didn’t have Twitter in order for him to try to get under MacDonald’s skin.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo in a nutshell, his wife tries to franchise a Popeye’s. McDonald’s says that that is a breach that family members of a McDonald’s franchise owner can’t go into business with a competitor. So he launches back and says, “Actually, while you’re at it, why can’t we talk about this racial discrimination that I’m experiencing, that I can not get restaurants outside of South Los Angeles. I absorb higher security costs as a result of the neighborhood that I’m in and I want a piece of the action somewhere else.” McDonald’s retorts like, “Be grateful. Look what I have given you.” Charles Griffis is always on time. He’s like, “You say you want me to be in my community. I’m a millionaire. I live in Bel Air. Why can’t I be in that community as a business owner?”', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThey go back and forth and it gets picked up by the New York Times. But I think at the heart of it is this question of what does an opportunity really look like or mean. I think for African-Americans who had been shut out of the possibility of this business structure, there was an expectation from the corporate parent that they would just always be grateful. In this exchange, you also realize that by confining the places where African-Americans can do business, you just exacerbate some of the issues of inequality that people thought business ownership would actually fix.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this conflict boils up where they’re in a little bit of a war with each other. So what ended up happening to Charles Griffis?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nWell, Charles Griffis, he gets the NAACP involved and the Los Angeles chapter actually initiates a selective boycott, which again is bananas because they have to invite people to boycott McDonald’s, but not the Black ones. You know which one of those are, they’re just in Black neighborhoods and that’s the point of this boycott. Everyone’s like, “What? What’s going on?” But it’s kind of like it makes sense, but it makes no sense. So eventually their case gets settled. McDonald’s claims that they did not pay Griffis a cent for his ridiculous claims about racism. He gets bought out and he later re-establishes himself in a business called “Chicken Charlie’s,” which he says he has gotten away from franchising, which is the white man’s game and now he’s doing something authentically Black.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThe implication for this conflict, I think, is more interesting because the NAACP enters into negotiations with McDonald’s and this is a strategy they used throughout the ’80s with corporations, that there’s a claim of racism, there’s some type of selective buying campaign or a boycott, and then they come to the table and it includes charitable donations. It includes sponsoring NAACP programs.', '[NEWS REPORT:15 AREA STUDENTS JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE WERE AWARDED SCHOLARSHIPS EARLIER TONIGHT, THANKS IN PART TO A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE NAACP AND MCDONALD’S. THIS MARKS THE 10TH YEAR OF THE TWO OF PARTNER TO PROVIDE JEFFERSON COUNTY STUDENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThen it opens up more white-collar jobs to African-Americans. So it never really settles the issue of redlining and it never really goes deep into that, but it creates this context that the remedy for racial inequality is opportunity and essentially reliving that moment over and over again today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo McDonald’s was doing this work behind the scenes with franchisees, but it also was doing these massive ad campaigns aimed at African-Americans. So how did McDonald’s try to appeal to Black customers?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo the idea that a big company markets to African-Americans is a pretty old concept that really took shape around the Great Migration, where you have a mass migration of Black people from the South who are moving to Northern cities and have more commercial choices, but things take a more ridiculous turn, if you will, in the 1960s where these market research firms, some Black-owned, are trying to do really tailored marketing to African-American. So they’re not just coloring the faces of models to make them Black or putting African-American models in the same types of print ads that white models would be in. They are trying to speak directly to that consumer market. So in the 1960s, African-American franchise owners convinced McDonald’s to retain the services of Burrell Communications, which is one of the most important African-American advertising firms of the period and up to today, and so they start marketing to African-Americans.', '[MCDONALD’S AD: BREAKFAST AT MCDONALD’S, SUITS MY FAMILY….]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThese ads are very of their time. There are Afros, there are Dashikis, there’s dropped Gs, there’s a lot of being cool. It is painful to look at in hindsight, but I do think that there is value to what this kind of marketing is animating for Black consumers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo McDonald’s used to run these ads staring a character named Calvin, and in the ads, Calvin is this young Black man who gets a job at McDonald’s and basically turns his life around and these were everywhere on TV. Let’s listen to one.', '[HEY, ISN’T THAT CALVIN?]', '[I HAVEN’T SEEN HIM FOR A WHILE.]', '[I WONDER WHERE HE’S HEADING.]', '[I HEARD HE GOT A JOB.]', '[IT’S ABOUT TIME HE GOT HIMSELF TOGETHER.]', '[NOW THAT YOU’VE MENTIONED IT, THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM.]', '[JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU CAN’T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.]', '[LOOKS LIKE RESPONSIBILITY’S BEEN GOOD FOR HIM. I WONDER WHERE HE’S WORKING.', '[CALVIN: WELCOME TO MCDONALD’S, MAY I HELP YOU?]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nOh, Calvin.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Calvin, indeed. That’s almost like a short film devoted to Black capitalism.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nIt has many parts too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. It keeps developing. I mean, he’s a young teen in this incarnation and then he gets older and then he gets fancy clothes later on.', '[MEET THE NEWEST MEMBER OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, CALVIN.]', '[CONGRATULATIONS!!!]', '[CALVIN: YES, I’M PART OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM NOW, MAMA.]', '[OH, BABY. I’M SO PROUD OF YOU.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe kids on the stoop are envious of the money he earns. So talk to me about Calvin and what you think of when you see these ads.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo Calvin is a creation of some market research about a concern that fast-food jobs are no longer cool. So the Calvin campaign was to make working at McDonald’s something that teens wanted to do, but it’s also a call back to some of the representations of African-American teenagers that were negative because part of the conceit of the Calvin ad is you think he’s like a bad kid from the street, but McDonald’s gives him so much discipline because they give him a job and he becomes a fixture in his community. This kind of ad, I think, straddles this transition from the ads in the late ’60s and ’70s – were working-class people, it was about being cool, it was hanging out. Then it transitioned into the ’80s, which is what I call the Cosby turn, more middle-class families and a little bit more aspirational in its tone.', '[MCDONALD’S AD: YOU DESERVE A BREAK TODAY, YEAH, SO GET UP AND GET AWAY TO MCDONALD’S]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThen in the late ’80s, early ’90s, using the tropes of kind of rap culture or the street culture to promote McDonald’s. So that’s the introduction of rap music.', '[MCDONALD’S AD: THE NEW DOLLAR MENU AT BREAKFAST IS IMPRESSIVE. I CAN BE SELECTIVE. I’M EGGING IT.]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThe thing I find hilarious about this is that Calvin is in a block in Harlem and the stoop his friends hang out on is now $10 million and has been in “House Beautiful.” But at the time it was supposed to indicate working-class communities. It’s this idea that McDonald’s isn’t just a presence in your community, in that it provides cheap food fast, but it has this effect on young people, young people that you would otherwise be afraid of and McDonald’s can kind of soothe your anxieties about them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI do want to not judge it too harshly in today’s mores and sort of treat it as it was, but there’s a line that’s just like “he isn’t what you’d think,” you know, it’s kind of stated and you’re like, “I don’t think anything. I’ve seen him for 10 seconds.”', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nYeah. Who’s the what, who’s the you?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, exactly.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nThese words are doing quite a bit, but also it was this idea that fast-food jobs are not dead-end jobs, and I think that criticism that emerges during that period is also being addressed here. I mean, so many things are happening in these ads, but they’re also saying it’s a cool place to work. It’s a good place to work. It’s not dead-end, and that for African-Americans, it can leverage them. In one of the final ads, he starts musing about one day becoming a franchise owner. It’s like Calvin has done the full capitalism loop.', '[FOR REAL?]', '[CALVIN!?]', '[CALVIN WHO USED TO HANG OUT ON THE CORNER?]', '[SO YOU OWN MCDONALD’S.]', '[NO, NOT YET.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo in addition to ads speaking to the values of being part of the McDonald’s family, there was also the incorporation of Black culture into McDonald’s ads, which brings us to the Double Dutch ad.', '[MCDONALD’S AD: BIG MAC, FILET O FISH, QUARTER POUNDER, FRENCH FRIES, DIET COKE, THICK SHAKES, SUNDAES, APPLE PIES.]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nIt’s this really kind of lovely, modest neighborhood. Everyone has a well-kept front yard and a group of people – related, maybe fictive kin – are watching these girls do Double Dutch and they’re just so good in terms of the athleticism and then they’re just having so much fun. I remember ads like that being really distinctive in that they’re showing African-American culture that was like visible to me. This could be my sister and her older friends doing Double Dutch, not as artfully, but doing Double Dutch, nonetheless. Those commercials were not only like a marketing strategy. They were also part of McDonald’s underwriting a Double Dutch league that would travel around the country that had its origins in keeping kids off the street and out of trouble.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nIn watching so many of these ads, I started to really think about not only the politics of representation and what it means for African-Americans to see themselves on television after having long histories of exclusion from the marketplace, but just the number of people who are paid, the number of Black creatives who are able to get jobs as a result of these huge marketing shifts. I think it’s important to acknowledge that even as I’m so critical and awful about the whole thing. Even though I’m the worst.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJust a killjoy. I think it’s easy to dismiss this sort of outreach in terms of marketing to the Black community as crass and commercial, but McDonald’s also was involved in establishing MLK’s birthday as a holiday.', '[MCDONALD’S AD: EQUALITY. MCDONALD’S JOINS THE NATION IN CELEBRATING THE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nWell, they were very early among the corporations that said MLK is something that we want to do because before Martin Luther King became this “warm, fuzzy” that people loved, that was a process. The first step in that was legitimating and essentially routinizing the MLK holiday. So after it’s passed in ’83, a lot of people are kind of not sure if this is something they want to get behind. There was a lot of conversation in Congress if Frederick Douglass should have a holiday because he was a more honorable American.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nSo the process of keeping the MLK holiday as a space in which to celebrate African-Americans, it needed help and McDonald’s African-American franchise owners really led the way in creating King ephemera, of underwriting some of the big parades and the celebrations. And corporate was behind it because I think that they had grafted so much of their entry into Black America onto the event of King’s assassination, and they were able to really parlay the King holiday into something accessible to a large audience. So I think that that kind of cultural work is, again, something that is so important to us because the way that the King holiday has been so sanitized and de-politicized, it’s hard to imagine a world in which a corporation sponsoring it would actually be a risky move.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo let’s move forward to the 1990s. So after the uprising, following the beating of Rodney King in 1992, the CEO of McDonald’s said that the restaurants in Los Angeles had been spared from looting and property damage and he said this was because of how McDonald’s adopted it’s “enlightened social policies more than three decades ago”. So does that ring true to you?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nIt’s such a weird thing to say. This was one of the early pieces of research that I found in working on this project and I was obsessed with this idea. The claim is so outrageous to me and so wildly inappropriate that I went to the archives of the University of Southern California that had all of the kind of commissioned reports about the uprising to try to disprove it. There’s a lot of speculative stuff that I can get into, but the point is is that some McDonald’s were targeted and one McDonald’s was a staging area for the National Guard. What I realized is it didn’t actually matter if this was true. It was the fact that McDonald’s had positioned itself after ’68 up into 1992 as being a member of Black America, that people believed it and they celebrated it. I have heard this story from Black franchise owners. I’ve heard this from business professors. It is in those case studies about corporate social responsibility. This narrative is so powerful.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDuring the recent protests, McDonald’s certainly hasn’t been hailed as a civil rights champion. Actually, at one of the McDonald’s here in Oakland, there’s been a strike going on over the safety conditions during the pandemic.', '[SO A FEW DAYS AGO, MCDONALD’S HAD THE AUDACITY TO PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING, “YOU’RE ONE OF US.” MCDONALD’S, BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS IS CLUELESS THAT THE BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE THAT IT HIRES, IT DOES NOT RESPECT THEIR BASIC RIGHTS.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOur producer, Emmett FitzGerald, went down to a protest outside that McDonald’s and he talked with one of the employees, Sandra Roman, who was picketing there. Here she is being translated.', 'Sandra Roman:', '\\n“Yeah. When the Health Department mandated to provide masks, we got masks, but they were doggy diapers and we have to wear them also for a few days until they break down. Also, the gloves that they provided to us, they were not special gloves, for example, for the cashiers. We were wearing the gloves that they use in the kitchen and they are really, really light gloves that they didn’t provide any protection to us.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this is a McDonald’s owned by a Black franchisee, and many of those striking workers at this McDonald’s are people of color. So what does this tell you about where we are with Black capitalism today?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nI guess the way we got here is that there is a notion that any opportunity is a good opportunity for Black America, that crumbs can sustain people who are hungry. I think what has happened is that the fast-food industry can continue to thrive in not providing people a safe and sound work environment. What we are confronted with right now is this distance between saying that a corporation supports Black lives and then the treatment of Black workers. You have the distance of celebrating the frontline worker and then not being concerned when the frontline worker gets sick. I think that I can see why franchise owners are so vulnerable to a number of these things. But I think that this is always a good time to take a step back and say, “Is this really the path toward freedom?”', '[WHEN WE FIGHT!]', '[WE WIN!]', '[WHEN WE FIGHT!]', '[WE WIN!]', '[WHEN WE FIGHT!]', '[WE WIN!]', '[EXACTLY, AND THAT’S WHY WE’RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE MCDONALD’S WORKERS WHO ARE STRIKING.]', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nI think that how well a merchandiser does or how many burgers sold should not have a material impact on whether people live or die. This is the place that I think I find myself in, that I actually don’t care if McDonald’s makes hamburgers and I actually don’t care if people eat them and whether you think they’re eating too many of them. I do care if McDonald’s is able to set a policy agenda that says we can pay workers this and everyone else is going to pay workers this, and this is how much suppliers can make and this is how we’re going to set the market to the detriment of people.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen you pass a McDonald’s today, what do you see? What do you want people to notice?', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nEvery time I passed McDonald’s or any fast food, I can usually tell what year it was built. The two things that have emerged from it. One, the fun part, is I’ve appreciated the creative energy of the fast-food industry. Prior to doing this work, I knew that it was a lot of work to work in fast food, but I think the skill involved in delivering so much food so quickly, hot, is still something that is so amazing to me, and that is so degraded, but the efficiency of it and the skill required to do it, I’ve become more appreciative of. Then what I also see is a place of deep meaning, even as I think it sometimes can undermine value. So I think I’ve come to a place of understanding that fast food can be harmful and it can be deeply meaningful and that is the space in which I think our best struggle comes out of.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThank you so much for talking with us. I really enjoyed our conversation. I really appreciate it.', 'Marcia Chatelain:', '\\nOh my gosh. This was so fun.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMarcia Chatelain’s book is called “Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.” There is so much more to the story than what we can cover here, so you really need to read it. We’ll have a link on the website.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBlack capitalism is often presented as a solution to African-American political and economic inequality, even though it’s proven to be completely inadequate. But another concept that has been talked about but has never even been tried is reparations. This is the idea of attempting to make amends for slavery and the economic inequality that followed by providing some form of financial compensation. We have a story about one person’s attempt at DIY reparations from the radio show, “The Heart,” that you do not want to miss, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOn the Radiotopia podcast “The Heart,” they ran a special mini-series by Phoebe Unter called “Race Traitor” where she examines her own white privilege and explores ways to disrupt it. And in the third episode, she considers the all-white neighborhood she grew up in and comes to the conclusion that her parents should give away their home to serve as reparations for benefiting from racist housing covenants. This excerpt starts with Phoebe talking about the moment a couple of decades ago when her parents set up a new life for their new family.', 'Phoebe Unter:', '\\nAnd then my parents’ decisions focused on us. They move us across the state line from Missouri to Kansas for better schools. We move into a big, beautiful house in a neighborhood called Mission Hills. I became aware of the man who built this neighborhood early in my childhood. His name is J.C. Nichols. It’s on street signs in Kansas City. And there’s a big public fountain named after him. I grew up thinking he was wonderful and important and cared about beauty and long-lasting quality architecture. I am told that when the house we live in was built, Black people and Jews could not have lived in it. And I’m told that’s just how it was then. It’s no longer enforcible.', 'Phoebe Unter:', '\\nThen five years ago, I’m reading this book. It’s actually a book my mom sent me in the mail, written by Tanner Colby. And there’s a chapter about J.C. Nichols. And for the first time, I read these words. “J.C. Nichols died in 1950, but his plan for permanence lives on. His racial covenants are still with us, auto-renewing year after year, like some horrible gym membership we’ll never get out of.” And for the first time, I read about how J.C. Nichols is known for perfecting the all-white neighborhood by using racial covenants, meaning that the property deeds for all the houses in his neighborhoods included this line. “None of said land may be conveyed to, used, owned or occupied by Negroes as owners or tenants.”', 'Phoebe Unter:', '\\nHis racial covenants became all the rage. Developers all over the country mimicked neighborhoods like Mission Hills. J.C. Nichols became so influential that coming out of the Great Depression when the federal government was deciding who should get low-interest mortgages to stimulate home buying and building, they brought J.C. Nichols into the Oval Office to advise. And they copied whole sections of his company handbook right into their brand new policies. The policies that became known as redlining and redlining influenced the value of housing for decades into the 50s when returning World War II vets were looking to buy property. That’s when suburbs took off.', 'Phoebe Unter:', '\\nAnd then I read this, “The suburban land grab of the 20th century was one of the single greatest engines of wealth creation in human history. It took a country of second and third-generation white ethnic immigrants, vaulted them into the middle class, and sent all their kids to college.” I know I was naive. Shouldn’t everyone assume what they have comes at the expense of other people? We live in America. This is its foundation. But it’s one thing to know this generally and another to see the specific ways what I have, came at the expense of others.', 'Phoebe Unter:', '\\nFor my parents, though, it’s not that big of a deal.

Nichols’s legacy because we’re not innocent living on land, that, first of all, is stolen from indigenous people and then made into neighborhoods where people of color were kept out, stripping those families of the chance to buy property to pass on to their children, like my parents plan to pass on their house to me.

They are a live magazine show created to be performed on stage in front of a live audience. Pop-up is this really beautiful ground-breaking leap forward in journalism but since there are no theater shows happening right now, they’ve been making stories to enjoy at home and this one was so delightful and so up my alley, I just wanted us all to do it together.

The best solo walks I can remember are like before, when I was single living in New York City. You start at Union Square in Manhattan, and you discover that you don’t have much to do in a day, and you just, like, start walking. And then you, like, look up the movie times. And then you, like, realize you could go to a movie, and you’re gonna walk to Duane Reade ahead of time and get, like, a big liter of club soda and trail mix and maybe a little bit of chocolate and stuff it in your purse (laughs). Man, to spend a day that way, (laughs) right now. As someone with two little kids and a couple of dogs, like, to just walk with no destination seems so luxurious. I also want to give a special shout out to the walking in New York City while crying on a cellphone walk. At a certain point, you’re like, I don’t care.

It’s just when the snow, the first snowfall, it looks so beautiful when you’re first going out there. It’s like, oh, it looks so pretty. Until you get out there and have to start walking. And people don’t shovel. You slip and slide down the street. And I’m not embarrassed to say, there’s been a few times I had to sit on the steps to get down off the porch (laughs). Yeah, because I do not want to fall, and there have been times I have fallen down some steps, and it wasn’t cute (laughs).', 'The good things about being on a route as long as I’ve been on is knowing everyone’s name.

Thank you.” And I was walking up to the house ’cause I had my head down getting the mail ready when I looked up, it made me cry. And I knocked on his door. He came to the door, and I was like, “That’s so sweet of you to put that out there.” He’s like, “I just want to let you know you’re an awesome carrier. You always look out for us.” Because when he gets his medicine, I walk to the side door, I knock on the door, him and his wife come and get it. I don’t leave it on the front porch.

Tasmania is the most mountainous island on Earth. And so, every walk you go on, you start close to the ocean and then you just walk uphill really quick. But as you go up, you traverse different vegetation layers, and you go through curtains and curtains and curtains. So you might start in coastal scrub with this pungent aroma of the peat soils, and you’ll climb up into a deeper forest along the creek line, and it will be rainforest, a temperate rainforest (sounds of water in the forest with birds in the background). The air is cold on your face. It’s filled with every type of green from the mosses and the lichens to the rainforest trees, the myrtles and the sassafras.

And I started to bundle up and go for the short walk out to the pet cemetery to say hello to the buried pets. There’s Cheeky and Boopy (dog barks, growls) and Nedsy. I say their names, and sometimes I just, like, sort of croon at them and say like, “Hello sweethearts.” And I sort of imagine, like, you know, transparent little ghost dogs, like, nipping at my heels (spooky music continues) I felt like I could imagine that they felt found again.

Sometimes he does try to make those decisions. So if he is walking and he sees a squirrel (squirrel sound), his ears perk up. I feel it in his body (dog panting). His attention is distracted.

There’s something about the rhythm of pushing a chair and the sounds that our wheels make. The fact that we are connected in this way is, is, is, sometimes it’s really sexy.

Earth is its own spaceship, and we’re all here alone.” And, and it’s really a vulnerable place.

The first thought I came to my mind was that miserable hoarders took it all. And then I started contemplating the volume of a package of toilet paper, especially those massive, you know, like “the equivalent of 96 rolls” packs you see at Target, and thought, if just a couple dozen people bought one extra package, that would clean out an entire shelf. And buying one extra package is not that unreasonable if your whole family is trapped in the house and not using the toilet at work or at school or out in the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this run on toilet paper is not limited to the United States.

So Stephanie, what have you seen firsthand?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nSo a month ago, when people really started going crazy over toilet paper, I actually heard about this company here in New Mexico where I live that makes toilet paper. It’s called Roses Southwest.

What do they normally do?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nSo Roses doesn’t usually sell directly to the public sale. There’s this funny division in the toilet paper world between “at-home” and the “away-from-home” markets and Roses is an “away-from-home” wholesaler. So when you’re out in the world at a restaurant or a sports stadium or a convenience store, they sell toilet paper to those businesses, but as you said, of course, now fewer people are out in the world using those businesses. Instead, everyone is trying to stock up their paper at home where they’re spending all of their time and that’s part of the reason why it’s flying off the shelves.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nSo in an attempt to help people who are trying to get toilet paper, Roses has decided to sell directly to the public at a kiosk right outside their factory. And I was curious, who’s going to show up to these sales so I decided to go down to their public sale. It was on a Friday morning a few weeks back, I should say before New Mexico’s asked people to stay at home. I woke up super, super early and headed down to Albuquerque to check it out and let me tell you, I was not prepared for the scene.

Coming from literally every direction. I found out later that the longest line was almost three miles long.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThree miles!', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYes. Which is crazy! So of course, I started to interview people waiting in their cars in line. And just a warning, the audio quality isn’t super great. I was using this really long pole to hold the microphone so I could stay at least 6 feet away from people and I was talking to people through their rolled down passenger-side window for the most part so, it’s not the best audio quality.

We had to. I just opened the door and she used it on the side. I told her, ‘I’ll hold you like you’re sitting and just pee,’ I told her.”', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\n“Really?“', 'Brittanie Perea:', '\\n“We did it on the side right here.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my Lord. She had her daughter pee out the door of the car while waiting for toilet paper? There are so many levels of irony to that.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYeah, I know. And Brittanie realized how insane all of this was. She told me that when she had seen the line earlier in the week when she was running errands, she had laughed at the people who were lined up. She thought they were ridiculous.

What’s clear is that people are willing to go to extreme lengths to avoid running out of toilet paper.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYeah, I mean, obviously you get the point, but I find this super fascinating. I mean, toilet paper is like, I guess important, but it’s also not perishable. It’s not food or water. So why were so many people desperate for toilet paper?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is a good question and one of the reasons why we wanted to talk to you. I wanna know actually, how we became so reliant on this one product?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nRight and so I decided to actually look into the history a little bit and fundamentally, this is a story about the genius of marketing because obviously for most of history, people would have thought it was insane to manufacture something specifically for the purpose of cleaning yourself.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nBasically, people would use what’s ever, no pun intended, at hand, including their hands.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nThis is Ron Blumer. Blumer wrote a book called “Wiped.” It’s a history of rear-end hygiene and he says that for most of human existence, people didn’t have anything like paper. They used rocks. They used shells. They used moss. Or they used the original cleaner, water.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nThe idea is you wet your hand with water and you use your left hand to clean your rear end and then you wash your hand and then you rinse and repeat, as they say.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean this makes sense. There are some cultures where your left hand is used for ablutions for cleaning. That’s just part of the ritual and then your right hand is for eating and greeting people, so water makes a ton of sense to me. Shells, on the other hand, do not make that much sense.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYeah, I didn’t get into too much detail with Ron about how exactly that would work. The historical method that I, personally, found myself questioning that he described was the Romans.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nThey had a sponge on a stick, which was sitting in a pail of water in these communal bathrooms and they would use it to clean their rear ends, and then they’d put it back in the bucket. And then the next person would swish it around, hopefully, pick it up and clean their rear end.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my God, that’s horrifying!', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nI actually can’t think about it for too long. I’m telling myself, they didn’t know what we know about germs. They didn’t know.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, totally.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nThere’s all these methods that sound a little wild today but there actually is one part of the world though where disposable toilet paper has been used for a really long time, and that’s China. China is, of course, where paper was invented and starting in 500 hundred or so, there are records of paper being used for wiping. And then starting in the 1300s, there are actually records of paper actually being made specifically for use in the toilet.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo when does the idea of using paper catch on in the rest of the world and the west?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nIn the 1600s and 1700s, paper is starting to become really widespread. The first newspapers get printed. You know, paper that’s explicitly meant to be thrown out, and then in the late 1700s, we actually figure out how to make paper out of wood. It was made out of rags before and suddenly paper gets a whole lot cheaper. And most people are still using whatever is on hand but it does also become common for people to use paper. Now, this isn’t paper that’s specifically made for bum wiping. It takes a few more decades before anyone was actually making paper that was intended for that particular purpose. That was in the 1850s and Blumer credits a guy named Joseph Gayetty with selling the first actual toilet paper in the western world. And Gayetty’s sales pitch was basically that using newspaper was bad for you.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nAnd so he decided to make this a form of paper, which was thin and, as he sold it, more gentle on your delicate membranes and helping if you had hemorrhoids.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, this toilet paper, would we recognize it as the toilet paper we have today?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nI don’t think so, no. It came in a box like tissues and it was made of hemp. And Blumer actually told me he got his hands on an original box of it.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nIt feels a bit like what we would call tissue paper. I don’t think we would be very happy using it, but it was thin and I guess it would sort of do the job.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nThis was not a hugely popular product. It cost a lot of money so only rich people could afford it and most people really just didn’t see the need when there was so much free paper out there. The Sears and Roebuck catalog cost absolutely nothing. It came in the mail. The whole toilet paper thing just didn’t take seem necessary to most people. And it might not have taken off if not for the fact that around the same time, there’s another big change that happens in the human waste disposal world. And that change is indoor plumbing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo now people not only have toilets inside their houses but those toilets are connected to pipes and sewers systems as a way of disposing of the waste.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nExactly. But as anyone who has spent time plunging a toilet before can tell you, you can’t just be flushing newspaper down a toilet. You need something that’s more delicate than that.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike Gayetty’s paper! So fortuitous.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nExactly. So, Gayetty actually pivots and he starts marketing his paper differently as good for use for indoor toilets and other people start to get in on the business. Among the early adopters is this guy from Albany, New York named Seth Wheeler. And Wheeler is really the guy who creates toilet paper as you and I know it.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nWheeler came up with the idea and patented the idea of having a roll that was perforated so that you could rip off a sheet at a time and also he had to invent all the mechanisms, the roller, to hold it because people wouldn’t have it. So he would sell the unit as a whole.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo this guy is responsible for not only putting toilet paper on a roll but actually dividing it into sheets. It really is the toilet paper as we know it.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYeah, he’s a toilet paper inventor. In the years after, he patents all these other kinds of ideas related to toilet paper. Some of them, I would say, more practical than others. He has the patent on hexagonal toilet paper which he thought would be easier to tear from the roll. He has a patent on half a dozen different kinds of paper holder designs. Basically, he spent the rest of his life thinking about how to improve toilet paper.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI love people like that. I love people who are obsessed with these things. I mean, I don’t know if he’s a pleasure to be around as a person but I’m glad those people exist in the world.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYeah. I can’t imagine what his dinner conversation would have been like but he was definitely a super successful inventor and he was a fine businessman. His company sold a lot of toilet paper but he is not the person who actually makes toilet paper an American essential. That is one of his competitors at the time, the Scott Paper Company.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is the same Scott Paper Company that sells toilet paper today that you see… or like you used to see in the toilet paper aisle.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nLike you used to see in the toilet paper aisle. Yeah, the very same. The Scott Paper Company starts making toilet paper right around the same time as Wheeler but they are much better at marketing. They take that original idea that toilet paper is the solution to hemorrhoids and they run with it.', 'Ron Blumer:', '\\nYou’d see these horrifying ads in newspapers and magazines of doctors with scary-looking surgical instruments. And the doctor was saying to the other doctor, “we wouldn’t have to operate on this man if his wife had bought Scott toilet paper.” And they would also attack their rivals by saying, “well, so-and-so has wood chips or splinters in their toilet paper. You wouldn’t want to use that.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNothing like fear to sell your product.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nTotally, yeah. They also sold it as this sophisticated luxury item. That was their two-pronged approach. There’s this one ad that’s in Blumer’s book that describes ‘women of intuitive daintiness’ buying Scott tissue.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIntuitive daintiness. Oh, I love it. It’s so terrible.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nIt’s so terrible, and it worked! They basically end up owning the market through the 1950s. And they make toilet paper this essential household product for most Americans.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo in less than 50 years, toilet paper goes from non-existent in the western world to totally indispensable because of the Scott Paper Company.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYes. So indispensable that people are willing to wait for 5 hours in line for it. Toilet paper now is a $30 billion industry. We use, as Americans – I looked this up – we use 28 pounds of toilet paper a year per person which is 141 rolls. So many trees.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo how are toilet paper manufacturers keeping up during this time of increased demand?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nI wanted to know too. So while I was down in Albuquerque, I actually set up a meeting with the sales and marketing manager for Roses Southwest. A guy named Gibson Archer.', 'Gibson Archer:', '\\n“Good time to be in the bath tissue business for sure.” [laughing]', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\n“Bath tissue. Is that the term of art in the industry?”', 'Gibson Archer:', '\\n“That’s the sexy term for it, right? Bath tissue. That’s so much better than toilet paper. Okay. Maybe not. But yeah, we do refer to it in the industry as bath tissue.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo is there actually a short supply of “bath tissue” then?', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nI mean, yes and no. Yes, there is a shortage if you’re trying to buy it at the grocery store but if you take a step back and look at the entire toilet paper supply chain, the answer is no. Unlike a lot of other things that are kind of hard to find at the moment, the toilet paper supply chain is actually almost entirely here in the U.S. or at least entirely in North America. And so, even though the coronavirus has disrupted a lot of things, it actually hasn’t disrupted the toilet paper supply chain. The trees are still getting cut down. Paper mills are still running.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nRoses has actually added an extra shift to try and keep up with the demand but keep in mind, Roman, it’s not like people are consuming toilet paper any faster than usual. They are consuming it differently. So people are using more toilet paper at home, as opposed to at work or at restaurants but that’s not more toilet paper overall. That’s just a breakdown in where the toilet paper is going and that’s the change that suppliers like Roses are currently adjusting to. So eventually, the supply should catch up to the demand.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd in the meantime, hopefully, you have enough rolls to get you through.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nHopefully, that or you have to get creative. Even Gibson who is, I will remind you, an actual toilet paper salesman, was willing to admit that when it really comes down to it, toilet paper is not that essential.', 'Gibson Archer:', '\\n“f you had to take society down to like, it’s survival level, we can live without it, but we don’t want to live without it. And so we’re seeing the stockpiling so that they can sort of check that off of their mental list of concerns and move on to the next one if it’s something they can go out and buy.”', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nSo when I was outside the factory interviewing people, I did actually ask everyone that I talked to in line what their backup plan was in case they did run out of toilet paper. Honestly, a lot of people were just like, “Nope, not going there. That’s not possible. They will not run out of toilet paper.” But a few people had actually thought about it and had some interesting answers including Brittanie Perea, the woman who I told you about who had her daughter pee out of the door of the car. She told me that as a kid, her family actually used newspaper.', 'Brittanie Perea:', '\\n“You know, we grew up a little poor with my great-grandma and we’d soften up the newspapers.”', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\n“Oh, wait, tell me more about that. How does that work?”', 'Brittanie Perea:', '\\n“Just get the newspaper and you know ruffle it up a little bit to make it soft.”', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\n“Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.”', 'Brittanie Perea:', '\\n“That’s how we used to back when I was little.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is a good tip. Although I should stress that you should not flush newspapers down the toilet, but if you want to support local journalism and have a backup cleaning system all at the same time, you know, subscribe to the paper.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYes, all for supporting your local newspaper. The other thing a lot of people said is that they’d just use water if they ran out of toilet paper, which surprise, is actually still how most of the world clean themselves after going to the bathroom. 70 percent of the world doesn’t use toilet paper. And most of those people just use water. In some places, they use bidets. In most of the Muslim world, people clean themselves with water and their left hand. And I think that sounds, maybe to some people, like it’s unsanitary but, let me remind you, that toilet paper sounds really gross to a lot of the rest of the world, like you’re just smooshing things around down there. Not actually getting clean.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nA few studies have actually shown that toilet paper does very little to stop germs from getting onto your skin. Like not actually more sanitary. Not to mention that, I’m sure you remember, the original claim that made toilet paper so popular. That it prevents damage to your delicate regions. That is not true. Toilet paper can actually make hemorrhoids worse. Doctors are not fans.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, I had a friend who had some surgery down in those areas and he always washed himself thoroughly with soap and water rather than with toilet paper cause it was so sensitive and he needed to get it more clean. He said this thing that just always stick with me, it’s that if you got feces on your hand, you wouldn’t use a piece of paper to clean it off. You’d clean it off with soap and water.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nI mean, that is what I’m saying. It’s not good design, it’s just good marketing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s just good marketing. That’s exactly right.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nAlthough bad design can be comforting especially in these times. If it makes you feel better, go out and buy your toilet paper but if you can’t find any, then maybe consider joining your friends and the rest of the world and use water, and then you can wash your hands.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich is another thing we should be doing a lot of. Everyone, keep washing your hands. Well, thank you so much, Stephanie. This was really great. I learned a lot.', 'Stephanie Joyce:', '\\nYou’re welcome.', 'Roses Employee:', '\\n“Good morning.”', 'Customer:', '\\n“Can I get the 400 sheet 2 ply, please.”', 'Employee:', '\\n“Yes, sir. That is $35.”', 'Customer:', '\\n“Okay.”', 'Employee:', '\\n“All right. One second. All right, so out of 40 you have $5 change. Here’s your receipt. Drive up this way. Give it to the fine gentleman over there who will get you loaded. Make sure to stay in your vehicle for me, sir. Thank you.”', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHere is Avery Trufelman.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter its journey, from a tree – to a factory – to a store – to your closet- to your bathroom – into the basin, toilet paper flushes into your private sewer lateral. And that wastewater goes to a public sewer line, to a facility where it gets cleaned.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nThe first part is collection and we screen it. We take out all the big pieces. Sometimes we find boots. Sometimes we find animal carcass…', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDid you say boots?', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nYeah, like a boot, like a foot boot.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nNelsy Rodiguez is a public information representative with East Bay Municipal Utility District, also known as East Bay Mud. East Bay Mud provides fresh water from way up in the Sierra Nevada foothills, and then after the water is not so fresh, they gather it up again.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nAnd we treat it. We disinfect it, we take out bacteria and virus, we clean it so that it is safe to be able to release to the San Francisco Bay.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThey run it through what they call digesters. There are 11 of them on the plant. They’re these circular massive basins that are just constantly churning.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nYou put the wastewater into this digester and then we put microbes in there and the microbes feed off the bacteria in there so they’re getting plump and they are then producing methane gas which we convert and use that gas to help run the plant.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI went on a tour of this facility once. It is as awesome as it is disgusting. I mean, it smells like sewage. But the machinery is objectively extraordinary.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nThis machinery is big and expensive. And so when we have issues of something that shouldn’t be in the wastewater system coming up and slamming into our filters, it can take a filter out of service for a while, while we have to replace it. And that’s just money that we’re really just throwing down the drain.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhich is why they filter out bike tires and boots and other big objects. But it is ALSO why East Bay Mud would like you to use toilet paper.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nBecause it’s thin it breaks down almost instantaneously in water. A paper towel, not so much. Even less with a wipe', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nEven the wipes that say that they’re flushable?', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nYes. Especially the wipes that say that they’re flushable. It’s an advertising campaign. It’s a marketing scheme that is not true.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDo not get anyone at your local utility started about “flushable” wipes!', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nThose wipes when they are flushed, they collect because they’re kind of floating in water and then they all start to bunch together and they create these huge — we call the, in the industry, we call them ‘turkeys.’', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBecause they look like turkeys.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nThey’re these huge gobs of gross wipes that just slam into our filters and they can be really disruptive to the machinery.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSince the shelter-in-place order, when there was the sudden demand for toilet paper, Nelsey says they’ve seen a lot more wipes show up in the wastewater.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nWe’re really asking the public to please do not flush those things.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut if you don’t have access to toilet paper, what do you do? What’s your next best option?', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nFacial tissues are decent enough. They’re still not preferred, they’re not as thin as toilet paper. It may be a last resort, but an actual cloth with soap and water. Jumping in the shower. We’re really asking for those kinds of things. You can still use the wipes, for sure use the wipes, but throw them in the trash, not in the toilet.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI mean, that’s what East Bay Mud is going to do with them anyway.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nWe just toss that thing in the garbage anyway. So you can save – you can help us save – public wastewater rates, public money, by not breaking our system with these wipes.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nNelsy is one of the East Bay Mud employees who is able to work from home. And East Bay Mud is putting some of their major projects on hold. But they can’t put everything on hold.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nWe certainly can’t stop treating water, we can’t stop fixing pipes that are broken.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo I was curious. Last time I went to the store, I saw that people were buying big packs of toilet paper and also buying gallons of water. I didn’t really get why but because I saw everyone else buying water, I bought some too. I assumed we were all bracing for some sort of Mad Max dystopian future where water would become currency. Which is a future I don’t want to rule out completely, but Nelsy says it’s not imminent. At least we’re lucky here in Northern California.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nIt’s understandable that people get panicked. But there’s no need to when it comes to your water. Our water is fine, we’re great. We do, however though, this is a really important point, we do recommend that everybody should have emergency water.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt’s just that East Bay Mud can’t control what happens underground. A pipe could still break. And they would still have to come fix it.', 'Nelsy Rodriguez:', '\\nI could mean we may have to turn your water off for, I don’t know, 4 to 12 hours. And in those instances, you will need your emergency water supply.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd we can all help avoid this in the first place by not flushing wipes. Or tires, or boots. Or anything else that’s not toilet paper. There are two things you can flush down the toilet: things that come out of your body and toilet paper. That’s it. That’s the PSA. Sorry if you can never eat turkey again.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Stephanie Joyce and Avery Trufelman, edited by Joe Rosenberg.

I really do. Not just mine and the ones I’m associated with, but I listened to dozens of podcasts a week and I’m always looking for some spark that excites me, comforts me, challenges me, entertains me. I love seeing the proliferation of podcasts. It would never occur to me to mock. Like, I know the joke, “everyone has a podcast now.” But I always want more. Not all of them are for me, but when one hits, I just get excited about its existence. I get excited about existence, in general. And this happened to me when I was listening to a new show called “California Love.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s a podcast about seeking to understand what it means to belong and not belong to the places that we are from. And the episode I thought would most resonate with you, my beautiful nerds, is about graffiti, which is a huge part of the visual expression of cities. There is a cultural war being played out before our eyes in the back and forth between taggers and anti-taggers. And this kind of humane story is about those sides and what it feels like to be in the middle of it, where the stakes to an outsider can seem so low but actually couldn’t be higher. This is “California Love.” Here’s Walter Thompson Hernández.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nIt’s spring 2017, and I’m on the 733 bus line heading west on Venice Boulevard. I’m sitting in the back of the bus. It’s the early afternoon and there’s nobody else sitting next to me. I’m listening to music on my headphones when I noticed an old friend hop on. It’s Ivan. And we used to be in the same circles when we used to tag in the early 2000s. Ivan hasn’t changed one bit. He still wearing oversized t-shirts and still speaks from the side of his mouth like he used to when we were teenagers. His hair still cut really low, too. It’s been more fifteen years since we last saw one another.', 'Ivan:', '\\n“What’s up, man?”', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nWe dab each other up and hug. He sits next to me.', 'Ivan:', '\\n“Hey, you still write?”', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\n“Yeah. I do still write.”', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nThis is “California Love.” And I’m Walter.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nI was twelve years old and I was wearing the gray crewneck sweater and matching sweatpants that the officers had issued to me. My last name was written on the back of my sweater to identify. In ’97, the Scared Straight program met at a downtown L.A. central police station. Three times a week, twice a week we had classes and on Saturdays, that’s when we had boot camp.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nThey made us do push-ups, burpees, squats, sprints, and more burpees and all on the station’s hot roof. About two dozen of us, all under the age of 17 were in the program, usually because the judge had ordered us to attend for some crime we had committed. One of the guys with a graffiti legend named Sight, a south-central writer whose name can be seen throughout the city. He was what writers called an all-city bomber. His stuff was everywhere. I was like, “Damn, that’s Sight.”', 'Sight:', '\\nWhat I do remember is, um, all the cops, getting mad at me, screaming at me in my face. The saliva all on my face.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nSome people were there for skipping school, fighting, or violating probation. But Sight and I, we were both there for graffiti vandalism.', 'Sight:', '\\nI had about ten or eleven warrants for graffiti, all kinds of stuff.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nI started tagging with a group of friends I met in middle school, and once I learned how to tag, I began to go out and paint the streets. Maybe it was all the things I was seeing and experiencing at home that drove me to be as far away from it as possible. My mom had a boyfriend at the time. This white dude who was unemployed and smoked weed and drank heavily every single day. He was abusive and controlling towards me and my mom. And he and I would often physically fight, which led to numerous visits from the police. Harlem was definitely somewhere I didn’t want to be. And Sight’s homelife? It was just as rocky as mine.', 'Sight:', '\\nMe and my mom were sleeping in parks in the car, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the night. We slept in a lot of backstreets in south-central L.A. and Western Imperial. And then the sheriffs will kick us out and we’ll move on one block over.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nGraffiti was a lot of things for me. It was an outlet. A way for me to take out the rage, the pain, and the hurt I was experiencing at home. The street and the walls, they were basically my therapy.', 'Sight:', '\\nI existed when I did graffiti. I existed. That’s why I started doing it. That sense of awakening or rebirth.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nThe first Saturday that Sight and I were there, the inmates and guards took turns yelling at us.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nAnd he and I smiled at each other the whole time. Ha! We thought they were suckers. Our moms were both with us that day. And we knew the guards couldn’t put their hands on us. So we felt safe and talked our (bleep).', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nBut Scared Straight? It actually didn’t scare me straight. In fact, it got me deeper into graffiti. About two years after I finished the program, I started catching spots of a guy named Aloe. He was a pretty well-known writer in the Graff world. And the crazy part? He looked just like one of my favorite rappers.', 'Aloe:', '\\nYeah, everyone used to call me Tupac.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nIn just a few months, we became like brothers and we join the same crew.', 'Aloe:', '\\nYou were young and willing to do graffiti. So I was like, hey, we could be besties and let’s do this together.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nAloe’s talking like an ohead right now. He’s really only three years older than me. He and I spent every day together painting the city. This means going out and tagging.', 'Aloe:', '\\nI remember there were times I’m like, “Ugh… I don’t really feel like doing this.” You’re like, “Come on, let’s go!” And I’m like “All right, let’s go.” And we would go. And then it’s like once we’re there, it’s like, I’m so glad I did this. There’s a lot of people to like… I know a lot of people and not everyone… Like they’ll say, “Oh yeah, yeah, let’s go, let’s go.” But like, who really wants to go? I mean, like, who’s really going to go?', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nAloe and I spent a whole summer together and our bond was stronger than any relationship I’ve had as an adult because he was also unhappy and tormented by his homeland. We were just kids who understood each other’s pain and how ignored we both felt. Aloe taught me how to tag on the Venice Blvd bus lines. We caught spots in the panels and the overhead lights.', 'Aloe:', '\\nI taught him how to do everything that he knows.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\n“Shut up!”', 'Aloe:', '\\nSo you’re scribing into a transparent case so people wouldn’t be able to see it. There has to be some way for you to make what you just wrote pop out into the world. So usually what we would do is we would take like dirt from somewhere.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nSo we lick our fingers and run the tops of the lights.', 'Aloe:', '\\nYou would smudge that on the spot. The dirt would end up filling the spaces of the graffiti spot that you just caught.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nBam. Now your spots are going to be seen.', 'Aloe:', '\\nI used to show him like different slap tags and how you write on the slap tag. For those of you that don’t know, like, post office used to have like stickers that people use for mailing. And graffiti artists, just go and grab them. They’re free stickers. We could just write what we want on them.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nWe’d sometimes go back to Aloe’s house after painting and lock ourselves in this room.', 'Aloe:', '\\nJust smoke and drink in there and play music. A lot of Wu-Tang, a lot of Tupac.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\n“All eyes on me.” (sings)', 'Aloe:', '\\nA lot of Naz, a lot of Biggie. And just write, just write, just write.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nWe wrote our names all over the city because we felt invisible. And it was fun.', 'Sight:', '\\nI existed when I did graffiti. I existed.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nWe painted a few overpasses. National Boulevard, Robertson, Crenshaw. We painted billboards on Venice Boulevard. We painted at the Belmont Yards, the L.A. River, and the Mona yards. We were everywhere. But our names rarely stayed up for more than a few days. For four years, I tagged and for four years, a white dude named Joe Connolly painted over our spots. 98, 99, 2000, and 2001.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nThis guy, Joe, made it his mission to buff our tags using paint and equipment he had purchased himself. Seeing him buff up my work wasn’t a good feeling because creating the art tool a lot out of me. Like this one time when I spent an entire night doing a piece with large bubble style letters on a rooftop near Pico and Robertson. And it was gone the very next morning. And I knew it was Joe. And it wasn’t just us. It was all of us. There was a whole city of kids putting up spots, trying to be seen. And then this white guy named Joe will come out of and erase us again.

I used to sleep in the garage with the dog right here in Normandy in 76. Because he couldn’t let me stay in his house. But he’s like I got a garage. I mean sometimes me and the dog would fight over who would sleep on the couch. That’s where graffiti really kicked into high gear because I was out, depressed, lonely, hungry. And this is the only thing that kept my spirits up. Letting that trauma out doing graffiti. It’s a human need to express yourself. Unfortunately, the lower classes and the impoverished don’t have the spaces and the walls to just be creative. They don’t own nothing.

The real outside of it, whatever that might be, and then make a living at. That’s cool. But if they don’t… if they aren’t allowed to tag, they won’t get there.

I left the world where I was completely seen, only to re-enter a world where being seen wasn’t guaranteed. And for a 14-year-old, it was all really confusing.

And they were like, “Yeah, we got this dude. We’ve been looking for this dude forever.” I’m like, “Wow.” And I’m all, through my head, I’m like, “I didn’t know graffiti was this serious.” If I knew graffiti was this serious, then I would have not been messing with it.

According to him, they had him date pictures of his tags to a more recent time to land within the statute of limitations. Sight was facing around 30 years in prison, so he did what you had to do, and he took a deal for eight years and eight months.

The way it happened and all the things that happened in the city, the city could have helped me. And they never chose to help me. They chose to desert me. They’ve never said, “We’re sorry about your son.” That’s, I think, one reason why I stay in graffiti at Bateman is because I’m not able to fix my life because you can never control… it’s like trying to herd cats. You can’t control (beep). So I can control graffiti which makes people’s lives better.

One day I received a call from a childhood friend, Nikki, telling me about the company she had just started in Compton. Nikki’s company was primarily hiring undocumented workers and formerly incarcerated people to groups of people who live with the most stigma. I walked inside of the lobby and saw a framed newspaper article featuring a black man standing in front of a graffiti wall. I took a step closer, and he looked really familiar. I took another step forward and noticed that the wall read S-I-G-H-T in big and bold letters. It was Sight. Oh, damn. That’s Sight from Scared Straight. “Do you know Sight?” I asked Nikki. “Sight?” she replied. “Yeah, he works here. He’s actually in the back driving the forklift. Let’s go see if he’s back there.” What are the odds?', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nThe three of us went out to lunch that day and began reminiscing about Scared Straight and graffiti. Something tells me to ask Sight about Aloe because there weren’t a lot of other black graffiti artists. So what’d I have to lose? “Aloe?” Sight replied. “Yeah, that’s my boy.” And my jaw dropped all the way to the floor. “Give me his number,” I said. I called him and nobody answered. I went home after lunch, and later that day received a phone call from an unknown number. I answered, and this mysterious voice asked, “Hey, is this Bezzo?” Aloe and I met up a week later at Earth Cafe in downtown LA. I was nervous, and I was scared because even though a lot of time had passed, I didn’t know how he felt. Maybe he felt abandoned by me. When I saw him, he didn’t really look like Tupac anymore.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nHe now had a ‘fro and tattoos sleeves halfway down his arms. Honestly, he looked like he had been through a lot, but he still had that same charming smile and that same laugh. So much had happened since we last saw one another. He had gotten married, he had survived two drug overdoses, he’s vegetarian. And of all things, of all the things in the world, he was studying to become a lawyer. A lawyer. We talked about our families, about food, and our friends. And towards the end of the night, he looked at me and said he had something to give me.', 'Aloe:', '\\nI was just like, “Hey, do you remember this?” And I remember your face was just like, “Wow.”', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nHe handed me a slap tag. Remember those post office stickers he talked about earlier. Well I had filled this one out the same night we got arrested. Before that weird Hawaiian punch craving.

I contacted him, and I spent a few days with him.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\n“How you doing, Joe?”', 'Joe Connolly:', '\\n“I’m good, man.”', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nIt turns out Joe hasn’t changed. He’s still covering up graffiti, and he’s still doing it for free. I was wrong about Joe. This dude really surprised me.

He buffed out a lot of his pieces, but he didn’t know the man. He thought Sight was just another dude from the hood who got caught up in the system.

He wasn’t the in your face Joe, the wild Joe, the “rah-rah-rah” Joe. He was soft, and he with gentle. And Sight, I’m pretty sure he felt the same way too. People see walls with graffiti on them and I think that the people responsible for the tags are criminal, but it’s hard to know that there’s a whole life behind the spray paint that emerges on the wall. And to be real, it’s impossible to see the things that people are dealing with at home. It’s already hard, enough being a teenager, but imagine not having a way to express yourself. That’s really hard. Some see it as property damage, but what about the damage people are experiencing in their own lives? Each piece of graffiti is a window into someone’s life. Sometimes though, the window is hard to see through because there’s writing on it. But each window and each wall tells a different story. The walls are the first thing I see when I travel to a new place. They tell me everything I need to know about where I’m at. They alert me of danger, tell me who lives in that community, and who I need to be aware of.', 'Walter Thompson-Hernández:', '\\nLet’s go back to that bus, spring 2017.

This place is called the Valley of the Fallen, and it’s likely the most controversial monument in Spain.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe valley is synonymous with Francisco Franco, the general who ruled Spain from the end of its bloody civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s reporter Jennifer O’Mahony.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nWhen Franco died, he became the valley’s most notorious inhabitant. His body was buried under a huge stone slab.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut as the decades passed after his death, anger about the monument grew. People began to push for the removal of Franco’s body. They argued there was no place in a democracy for a monument exalting a man who had tortured and killed thousands of Spaniards in the name of fascism. And then in October of 2019 …', '[NOW, THE SPANISH DICTATOR FRANCISCO FRANCO DIED 44 YEARS AGO. TODAY, HIS REMAINS WERE MOVED FROM THE VALLEY OF THE FALLEN-]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFranco’s body was disinterred, his coffin packed into a helicopter, and then flown to a graveyard on the outskirts of the city to be reburied.', '[FRANCO WILL LIE NEXT TO HIS LATE WIFE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE, THERE WERE SOME PROTESTS.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDespite all his torturing and murdering, Franco still has fans in Spain. Some see him as the emblem of a traditional Spanish Catholic life, and some actually like his fascist ideology and would like to see it make a comeback.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd so when his body was removed, hundreds of his supporters gathered at the new cemetery to wield swastikas and Franco-era flags and to perform the fascist salute in his honor.', '[DE HECHO, YO VIVÍ 19 AÑOS BAJO FRANCO Y ESPAÑA ERA UN PAÍS MARAVILLOSO, MARAVILLOSO.

You got your fascists, you got your antifascists, and there’s this monument honoring a very bad man from the past that people are arguing about. But this story is different because the Valley of the Fallen isn’t just a monument, it is also a mass grave.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThere are tens of thousands of other bodies still trapped in the basilica beneath where Franco used to lie. Many were ordinary civilians killed by Franco’s security forces during the height of the civil war.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd for years, their families have been trying to get them out. The story of the Valley of the Fallen can be traced all the way back to the mid-1930s when Spain found itself torn in two different political directions.', '[THE REPUBLIC — LA NINA BONITA — THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL. JOYFUL DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT SPAIN AGREE TO THE PROCLAMATION OF THE REPUBLIC.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nIn 1936, the country was a new democracy. Just a few years removed from monarchy when a group of left-wing anti-clerical Republicans won the elections. This horrified the right-wing Catholics in the country. That included Francisco Franco, a general in the Spanish army.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAfter the election, Franco banded together with other right-wing military leaders to carry out a coup. They believed they were on a divine crusade.', '[AND WHAT BEGAN AS A MILITARY COUP LED TO ALMOST THREE YEARS OF CIVIL WAR.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe right-wingers gradually seized control of Spain. Their death squads rounded up suspected leftists, and then paraded them through villages and shot them.', '[FOR BOTH SIDES, POLITICAL OPPONENTS BECAME ENEMIES TO BE HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED.]', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThis is Purificación Lapeña. Her grandfather Manuel and great uncle Antonio were among Franco’s victims. When I met her, she showed me photos of them as handsome young men back in the 1930s. Manuel worked as a village vet, caring for the animals of local farmers.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[Mi abuelo era veterinario e inspector veterinario pues cuidaba de los animales.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nHis brother Antonio was an ironworker. Both men had supported the leftists who won the elections and both had joined a union, making them targets for the right-wing nationalists.

Her great uncle was murdered a few months later. Over the years, word spread through the village that the ravine where Manuel well was killed was filling up with bodies. But it would take a long time for the family to find out exactly what had happened.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd they weren’t the only ones left without answers. Something similar was playing out for families across the country.', '[THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR, LIKE ANY OTHER, UNLEASHED THE PASSIONS OF CENTURIES OF HATRED. THE KILLING WAS UNRESTRAINED.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy 1939, the Civil War was over and Spain was in ruins. At least 400,000 people had died. Half of them were civilians who faced torture, assassination, and the unexplained disappearances of their family members.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd networks of mass graves now scarred the Spanish landscape. Some contained thousands of bodies. It’s estimated that Spain still has 114,000 missing people dating back to that time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Franco wasn’t interested in what happened to the bodies of his enemies, at least not at first. He was too busy consolidating his power. As the great superpowers of the world took up sides in World War II, he decided not to fight, focusing his energies on fully crushing his opposition at home.', '[IN AN OFFICIAL DECLARATION, GENERALISSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO STATES THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT JOIN THE GERMAN-ITALIAN-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AGAINST COMMUNISM. BUT HE SAYS THAT HE WILL EXTIRPATE COMMUNISM IN SPAIN.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe country now had a single political party and protest was effectively banned. Franco became known as El Caudillo, the Supreme Leader. And in a very savvy move, he continued to cultivate the backing of the Catholic Church.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nFranco was not a particularly religious man, but he adopted the idea, very cleverly, that his war effort was a religious crusade.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThis is Paul Preston. He’s one of the leading scholars of the Spanish Civil War and of Franco’s regime.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nAnd this guaranteed him the support of the Catholic Church internationally.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nWhich meant Franco could operate with relative impunity. He went about taking away many of the rights that Spaniards had gained during the 1930s. Women, for example, lost the right to divorce their husbands and have abortions. And they could no longer work outside the home without permission.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMen, on the other hand, could kill their wives for adultery. The government banned regional languages like Basque and Catalan. The Catholic Church ruled over every aspect of most Spaniards’ lives.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nThe ideas of Francoism are being pumped out from church pulpits, they’re being pumped out in schools to people who, in principle, would not have supported Franco, who are basically forced either to accept these ideas or go into what we call inner exile. In other words, to go into a world of silence.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd now that Franco had gained absolute power over the country, he wanted a monument to immortalize his great triumph.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nIt is to be, for him, what the pyramids were to the Pharaohs.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFranco commissioned the Valley of the Fallen in 1940. The building, he said, would rival the grandeur of ancient monuments.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then because he was Franco, he went about building the monument in the most fascist way possible, relying on the forced labor of his political prisoners.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nThe three camps were controlled by a brigade of city guards. We were counted every three hours to make sure that nobody has escaped.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThis is Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz. Back in the 1940s, he was a college student in Madrid and he got involved in anti-Franco organizing. After getting caught handing out pro-democracy pamphlets, Nicolas was sentenced to work at the Valley of the Fallen.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nWe had to sleep in barracks and well, at 7:00 or 8:00, we are supposed to be working.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause of Nicolas’s university education, he was put to work in the office, shuffling papers around for prison officials and filling in endless forms. But as he walked to and from his barracks each day, he saw men carving rock on pitiful rations of food and working with dynamite without protection.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nVery harsh work. And obviously, there was some people that were killed.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe construction of the Valley of the Fallen took an enormous human toll. An estimated 40,000 prisoners worked on the project. Some died from exhaustion, others inhaled pulverized granite and were killed by lung diseases many years later.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFranco hadn’t initially conceived of the Valley of the Fallen as a gravesite, much less a mass grave. But it would become one thanks to Franco’s twisted response to pressure from one of Spain’s main allies.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe Americans relied on Spain as one of their European partners during the Cold War. And when they heard about Franco’s plans for the Valley of the Fallen, they started to get nervous.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe monument was shaping up to be pretty confrontational and divisive. The Americans hoped Franco would dial it back a bit to make it a place that memorialized all the countries war dead, not just the Catholic crusaders.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd so Franco declared the Valley of the Fallen to be a place of reconciliation, a place where the dead for both sides of the Civil War would be laid to rest.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut then, once again, Franco went about making that happen in the most fascist way possible.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nPurificación Lapeña says that Franco ordered his people to bring him bodies from mass graves and cemeteries all over Spain. They dug the bodies up without permission and jumbled them together in boxes.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThen they drove them to the Valley where they were reburied in the crypt near the basilica. Finally completed, the Valley opened to the public in 1959.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNearly two decades later, when Franco finally died of heart failure, he too was buried at the Valley of the Fallen. He was laid to rest in a grand basilica above the bodies of the Spaniards he had tortured, killed, and then reburied in a mass grave where their families couldn’t find them.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd with Franco gone, Spain suddenly confronted a new future without El Caudillo.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nWell look, when Franco died, we were very happy to get rid of him. We were expecting that. We had a freezer full of champagne.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe three years between Franco’s death and the signing of a new constitution became known as the transition. The country moved from fascist dictatorship to multi-party democracy.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd starting in the late 1970s, Spain finally got to do what the US, Britain, and France had done more than a decade before. They got to have fun. A new revolutionary movement sprang up in Madrid and became known as La Movida Madrileña.', '[LA MOVIDA HAS CONSUMED MADRID, TRANSFORMING THE CAPITAL INTO EUROPE’S NEW MOVABLE FEAST.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nSuddenly, Spaniards could drink, dance, have sex outside of marriage, and make music about it. The transition seemed to have ushered in a new Spain. But the elation felt after Franco’s death was temporary.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nIt’s only after several years that you realize that a new democracy hasn’t solved all the problems that were brought by the dictatorship.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor one thing, there were reminders of the dictatorship everywhere. There were statues of Franco and his collaborators in central plazas all over the country. His name was on street signs. And of course, the Valley of the Fallen served as a colossal reminder.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nHow can you have a democracy and at the same time have a huge monument to the glory of the dictatorship built by political prisoners?', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nBut perhaps the biggest hurdle to fully addressing what had happened to the country under Franco was an agreement that became known as the Pacto del Olvido, the “Pact of Forgetting.”', '[UN AMNESTIA DE TODOS PARA TODOS. UN OLVIDO DE TODOS PARA TODOS.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAs one politician said, the pact would be an amnesty for everyone, agreed to by everyone.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt the heart of the Pact of Forgetting was legal forgiveness for all Franco-era crimes. It was a deal agreed to by parties on the right and the left. It was a massive compromise.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nThe whole process of transition to democracy was a transaction. It was a deal. It was a negotiation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPaul Preston again.', 'Paul Preston:', '\\nModeration, compromise, sacrifice was the only chance of getting even a glimmer of democracy. So that’s the context.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe left agreed to the pact because they wanted their political prisoners freed and their political parties legalized. They wanted to be able to live in this new democracy without fear of being tortured or murdered.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut as time went on, they had to grapple with the fact that the amnesty applied to people on the right too.', 'Fausto Canales Bermejo:', '\\n[Pues nosotros creímos que esa Ley de Amnistía era una amnistía para los pocos que quedaban presos políticos.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFausto Canales was a left-wing activist back in the late ’70s when the Pact of Forgetting went into effect. He knew back then that his father had disappeared during the Civil War when Fausto was just two years old. And he says that instead of making sure people on the left wouldn’t be persecuted for their political views, the amnesty law was primarily used to shield those on the right who’d killed civilians.', 'Fausto Canales Bermejo:', '\\n[Ocurrido eso nos echamos las manos a la cabeza hemos sido engañados absolutamente.].', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFausto says when he realized what had happened, he put his head in his hands. He felt he’d been tricked. The pact created a culture of silence around the atrocities of Spain’s past. It suppressed conversations about the killing of civilians during the Civil War and the long years of repression that followed. The pact basically said, “Let’s just not talk about what happened. Let’s move forward instead.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd as for the Valley of the Fallen, it became something like a shrine to Franco. Fascists would visit it from all over Europe to pay their respects and would mark his death with flowers every year. Franco was remembered even as the pact ensured that his crimes were slowly forgotten and erased.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFor people like Purificación, the pact just didn’t work. It was impossible to move forward without knowing exactly what had happened to her relatives. As time went on, her family and many others began to resist the taboo against speaking up. They began to talk about what they’d been through.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nPurificación says that during the 1980s, discussions that had long been kept quiet started to come out into the open.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd even if people didn’t want to listen, at least it was no longer unthinkable for families of victims to make their grievances known.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd as families began to talk more about what happened to them, they also started to organize around an important goal. They wanted to find the bodies of their missing family members that had ended up in the mass graves around the country.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd they weren’t going to wait for the government to give them permission. They began hiring forensic specialists and archeologists to help them find and dig up the bodies themselves.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Miguel Ángel Capapé:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nMiguel Ángel Capapé works for an organization called ARICO. It carries out private exhumations for families who want to find their murdered relatives.', 'Miguel Ángel Capapé:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAs Miguel showed me around the headquarters, I noticed a wall of boxes and asked what they contained. He told me that inside was skeletons, some broken into pieces by torture and the years spent underground. Now waiting to be washed and identified.', 'Miguel Ángel Capapé:', '\\n[Si los lavamos aqui.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nI asked him how families typically react to seeing these broken bodies emerge from the ground after waiting for answers for so long.', 'Miguel Ángel Capapé:', '\\n[Es todo. Llevan muchos años peleando primero buscando a sus familiares porque hay mucha gente que no sabe dónde están.].', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\n“It’s everything,” he says. Especially when they’ve spent years trying to learn where their loved ones were buried. Having a real funeral makes a huge difference to people.', 'Miguel Ángel Capapé:', '\\n[SPEAKING SPANISH]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor a long time, the work of people like Miguel happened below the radar and without support from the state. But then in 2007, a new law went into effect that gave a boost to these efforts to uncover the crimes of the past. The new law was called the “Historical Memory Law,” and it broke the Pact of Forgetting. For the first time, victims of Franco-era crimes received official recognition. The law called for the removal of Francoist symbols from public places. And lots of new money flowed to the excavation efforts happening at mass grave sites across the country.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nPurificación Lapeña and her family seized their chance. They contacted Eduardo Ranz, a human rights lawyer who was helping to investigate crimes dating back to the Franco-era. Eduardo started looking into the case of Purificación’s grandfather and great uncle.', 'Eduardo Ranz:', '\\n[Una investigación reúne datos y se llega a la conclusión que su padre su abuelo su tío no está en esta fosa y no está en el Valle de los Caídos.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nHe learned that Purificación’s relatives were not in a mass grave near the town where they’d been killed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nInstead, they were among the bodies that had been moved to the Valley of the Fallen before it opened in 1959. They’d been jumbled together in boxes with other remains and then transferred into the crypts of the basilica. When reburied, their names had not been written down.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nAnd Purificación’s family wasn’t the only one hearing this. All told, around 33,000 bodies had been reburied at the monument.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[Nosotros eramos… cuántas seremos más o menos 9 en la asociación pero ahí están ahora por ejemplo 31].', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nPurificación eventually banded together with more than 30 families. They filed a series of legal complaints that wound their way through regional, national, and European courts over the course of many years.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[CONTINUES IN SPANISH]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then in 2011, the government asked a panel of experts to consider the future of the Valley of the Fallen.', '[SPANISH LANGUAGE NEWS CLIP]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe panel recommended that Franco’s body be removed from the Valley, a small victory for those who’d long said that the Valley was a monument to fascism. With Franco’s body moved to another cemetery, at least the fascist pilgrimages would stop.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nBut the panel also said that identifying and removing the tens of thousands of other bodies was not practical. Purificación was once again denied the chance she’d hoped for.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[Lo siento pero es que ya son muchos años.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\n“It’s been so many years,” she says. She laments the fact that her father is 95-years-old and has lost his memory. He’ll never know what happened to his own father.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is true for thousands of Spaniards. Of all those buried in the Valley, 21,000 could be identified. The other 12,000 people remain nameless. The only thing known is where their bodies came from in Spain, offering a small sliver of hope for families still searching for their loved ones.-The efforts to address Spain’s fascist past remain patchwork, not just at the Valley of the Fallen, but across the country. There are still Franco era statues and street signs. And recently, more insidious reminders of the dictatorship have been re-emerging in the country. A new far-right party known as VOX won seats in parliament last year.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nTheir slogan? “Hacer España grande otra vez.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“Make Spain great again.”', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nVOX would never actually claim to be fascist, but their policies align with what Franco represented. They want a border wall with Morocco. They want to take away the power held by Spain’s regions in favor of national unity. They would deport all undocumented migrants, and they’re totally opposed to a gender violence law that would tackle Spain’s shamefully high levels of domestic violence.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTheir rapid rise has been driven by Instagram memes and YouTube videos. A recent election spot showed the party’s leader, Santiago Abascal, striding through a Castilian landscape and talking about honor and national pride and about refusing to live among traitors.', '[ELECTION AD CLIP]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nVOX puts on events which attract a lot of young people who have never voted before. And many of them don’t even know who Franco is. In a lot of ways, the Pact of Forgetting actually worked. Recent history isn’t taught in Spanish schools, which means that young people are more susceptible to VOX’s appeal. They don’t understand the party’s connection to Spain’s bloody history.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nFausto Canales, the left-wing activist, says his own father is believed to be in the Valley of the Fallen. But every attempt to get him out has been blocked. After living with the pain of his father’s murder his entire life, Fausto has watched VOX’s rise with increasing alarm.', 'Fausto Canales Bermejo:', '\\n[España es el país de la desmemoria — fue olvidado todo este drama que ocurrió toda esta todo este genocidio.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nHe says Spain is the country of amnesia. So much tragedy. A genocide has been forgotten.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAfter Franco’s body was removed from the valley, VOX accused the government of using the exhumation to score political points ahead of an election, drowning out the calls from families to take their own loved ones out of the monument.', '[VIVA ESPAÑA, ALZAD LOS BRAZOS, HIJOS DEL PUEBLO ESPAÑOL, QUE VUELVE A RESURGIR.]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nMeanwhile, pro-Franco protestors gathered at the Valley and sang Spain’s old national anthem, which is peppered with fascist lyrics.', '[CROWD CHANTING OLD NATIONAL ANTHEM]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nThe anthem was retired after Franco died in favor of a wordless melody you just nod along to. But now, they’re singing the lyrics again.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOpinion is now divided on what the future of the Valley should be.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nThe government has been spending a lot of money to keep in good shape the monument. Stop it. Not a dime more.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nOnce all the bodies are out, Nicolas would leave nature to take its course, just let the monument fall down.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nThe only problem is that nature works, but it works very, very slowly.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nPurificación says the most important thing is to get the rest of the bodies out of the Valley, not just Franco’s.', 'Purificación Lapeña:', '\\n[Yo querría que todas las fatto todos los familiares que tengan asesinados en el Valle de los caídos de las cunetas de los cementerios que se sacan todos los restos de toda España porque es una gran fosa, España es una fosa…]', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nShe says, “What I want is for every family with murdered victims in the Valley of the Fallen or thrown in ditches, I want them to dig up all of these people buried all over Spain because Spain is a mass grave. My idea would be to exhume them all and for them to be given back to their families and dignified with burials in cemeteries, where they should be. The story of what really happened should be known and taught in schools so that everyone knows the real history of what happened.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 2016, a judge ordered an exhumation of Purificación’s family members. It was the first and only time that had happened in Spain.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nBut it still hasn’t been carried out. Purificación and Fausto were told that with Franco’s body gone, this might be the year. And while they’re not getting their hopes up, it’s true that in Spain the dead have a way of surprising the living.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up after the break, Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz, the student who was sentenced to work at the Valley of the Fallen, well, he eventually escaped. And the story of how that happened is pretty wild. Stay with us.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo as a reminder, Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz was the student who was imprisoned at the Valley of the Fallen for a few months during its construction. He didn’t do hard labor. He worked in an office job there. But it was an awful place and a lot of prisoners tried to escape. It’s estimated there are 50 attempted escapes between 1940 and 1959.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nBut the only true escape that succeeded were those of my friend and myself. The rest were caught.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd how Nicolas did it is a pretty crazy story so we to bring back Jennifer O’Mahony to tell us a bit more. So Jennifer, tell us what happened with this escape.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nSo to begin with, there were a few things that made escaping from the Valley of the Fallen difficult. The Valley wasn’t actually really heavily guarded, but it was set very deep in a forest. And if anybody managed to walk out, they get picked up as soon as they got to the nearest road. And in Spain at that time, the roads were really heavily policed and Spaniards needed special permission just to travel around their own country.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if an escaped prisoner even made it out to the road, there was little chance they’d be able to make it any further because of all the guards.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nIt would be very difficult. So Nicolas understood that context and he reached out to a good friend of his, an architect who drafted him some fake travel permits. And the next thing Nicolas did was write a letter to some of his friends who were exiled in Paris, and he asked them if they could help him get out of the Valley. And those friends just happened to be connected to Norman Mailer.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNorman Mailer, the author? I mean, was he already famous at this point?', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nYeah, this was just before his debut novel came out. He wasn’t quite famous yet, but he was just on the cusp of it. And he was one of a number of writers and artists from the US who’d got very interested in the anti-fascist movement in Europe.', 'Norman Mailer:', '\\n“Fascism goes back. To our infancy and our childhood, where we were always told how to live. We were told do this, don’t do that. No. No. Yes, you may do that. No, you may not do that.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s a very Norman Mailer take on fascism. So how did he get connected to Nicolas’s friends?', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nWell, according to Nicolas, apparently Mailer was on holiday in France and he’d had a chance encounter with his friends. Mailer mentioned he’d be going back to the US quite soon, that he’d bought a car and he was trying to get rid of it before he left.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nAnd a friend said we need your car. And he said, well, I’ll give it to you. But I also will give you my sister to drive.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nSo that would be Mailer’s sister Barbara, who had also been in France, and she was also interested in the anti-fascist movement. And she began corresponding with Nicolas via his friends. They wrote letters back and forth. And eventually they agreed on a day and time when she’d come to the valley in Norman Mailer’s car, driven by one of Nicolas’s friends to take him away.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt all sounds kind of surprisingly easy.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nYes. So the fact that Barbara was an American and the fact they were in a car, in a strange way, it meant they aroused much less suspicion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt seems kind of like the benefits of being an American in that situation.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nYeah, well, at this time, almost any foreigner really had a certain amount of privilege in that respect. So on the appointed day, Nicolas and a friend of his from university who was also jailed for pro-democracy activities snuck out of his barracks and found Barbara waiting for them with their mutual friends. They were just parked there in front of the monument.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were just like sitting outside, they beeped a couple of times, and they come running out.', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nYeah, according to how he tells it, Nicolas and the fellow prisoner hopped into the car and then Barbara drove them to northeastern Spain and dropped them at the border with France. And then there was a hard part. Nicolas had to hike with his friend through the Pyrenees Mountains for three days, walking only at night and hiding out, or sleeping during the day to avoid police. They were trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. And finally, on the third day, they saw a road sign written in French.', 'Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz:', '\\nIt was written in French and we found an old Frenchman with a long mustache. And we began to talk with him and he said, you are safe here in France.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWas it typical for people fleeing Franco’s Spain to go into France seeking safety? I mean, like, were there lots of people hiking to the Pyrenees, just as Nicolas did?', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nWell, Nicolas was following a route established by hundreds of thousands of political refugees actually, when the Republican forces lost their last battle to Franco’s nationalist army in 1939. So at that time, men, women, and children made their way into France through the mountains. But by the time Nicolas made that journey, it was a lot less common. I mean, Spain wasn’t a totally closed country like North Korea. But he was a fugitive. So it was a bit different for him.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so what did Nicolas do once he got into France?', 'Jennifer O’Mahony:', '\\nWell, as any of us would, I guess, he got in touch with his family. And his father, a diplomat who was in exile for his own safety, told him to come to Argentina. So Nicolas flew out and reunited with his family there and he wouldn’t return to Spain until Franco’s death.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s such a cool story. All right. Thanks so much, Jennifer.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn the heart of the Caribbean, there is a tiny little island called Anguilla. And I mean tiny. At its widest point, it’s only about 16 miles across. But while it’s small, its white sandy beaches and crystal blue waters have made it one of the most desirable tourist destinations in the Caribbean. It’s got all-inclusive resorts and you can swim with dolphins. The island is the ideal place to film an episode of “The Bachelor.” In fact-', '[TONIGHT ON ‘THE BACHELOR.’]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey did. Season 15, week 7.', '[WOO HOO, ANGUILLA!]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut back in the 1960s, Anguilla didn’t have any of the beachside villas, or luxury spas, or golf courses that it has today.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nIt had dirt roads, no electricity, one stoplight in the middle of town.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s Emily Oberman. She used to visit the island on family vacations as a kid.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nWhen you wanted to get a message to someone, you pinned it to this very specific mahogany tree, in the center of town, in the valley.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEmily’s parents were successful graphic designers from New York City, and they liked to travel off the beaten path. This was particularly true for her father, Marvin.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nMy father was incredibly gregarious, and charming, and smart, and quick-witted, and a total wise ass. And he always was ready to take someone in his arms and dance with them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou can tell Emily loves her dad a lot. Both her parents really. She is an extremely successful graphic designer in her own right, but she gives her parents the credit.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nAbs-a-frigging-lutely. I am a graphic designer because of my parents.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAfter her dad passed away in 2018, it was actually a graphic that he helped design that got Emily thinking about Anguilla again.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nMy father had recently passed and so I had gone through a bunch of his stuff and came across a small flag.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe flag was all white, with a thin strip of brilliant turquoise blue at the bottom, and three orange dolphins arranged in a continuous circle in the center. Almost like a recycling sign, but, you know, with dolphins. Emily knew that her father had gotten involved with the design on one of their trips to Anguilla. And that it had actually flown there for a couple of years. So four decades, later inspired by this keepsake. She decided to take a trip back to Anguilla, to honor her father and show her own family this place that had been so important to her childhood.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nI hadn’t been there in 40 years. So it was going to be an adventure and an experience for me. But I thought probably an emotional one because it had been so meaningful to my family.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn April of 2019, Emily packed up her husband and sons, and they schlepped through the cold to Newark airport. Hopped on a plane to St. Martin, where they boarded a ferry.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nAnd as we were approaching, there was a big sign, welcoming you to Anguilla. And it was on a white building with orange and turquoise typography. And I looked at it and thought, “Huh, that’s cool. I recognize those colors.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were the same colors as her father’s flag: orange, white, and blue. And she noticed them a lot.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nI suddenly began to see the color scheme was everywhere. The pylons along the highway had those three colors painted on them. And the color theme was just everywhere. So it was a little bit of a surprise and a delight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEmily’s father was an amateur writer. So when Emily returned home from her trip, she looked through his folder of stories to see if she could find out more about this flag.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nWe looked through his stories and sure enough, there was the story of the Anguillian flag.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt turns out that her father’s dolphin flag was a bigger deal than Emily had realized. And that her parents, a couple of graphic designers from New York City had played a very small, but not insignificant role in a key moment in the island’s history. Because this flag, that had been collecting dust in the family attic, was a symbol of one of history’s strangest political revolutions.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nWhen I was born, there were dirt roads, no running water, no telephone.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Timothy Hodge, former president of the Anguilla Archeological and Historical Society. Like Emily Oberman, He was a kid in the 1960s and he remembers the island a lot like she does.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nNone of the comforts that we have today. Very little commerce, very little employment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnguilla had been one of Great Britain’s many overseas colonies since the 1650s. But unlike many of Britain’s other territories, Anguilla was missing a lot of essential services, like electricity, paved roads, proper schools. Mostly because the British neglected it.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nBasically, if you read the historical records, it was not recognized as having any value to the British Crown. So nobody paid any attention to it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEven though the island has a history of slavery, Anguilla’s soil wasn’t fertile enough for large scale agriculture. And according to Hodge, if the British couldn’t establish widespread slave plantations on Anguilla, then they didn’t have much use for it. And so for decades, centuries even, they basically ignored the island. Which meant Anguilla got very little funding for development.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nIt was this island that was unto itself, existed unto itself. And this is the Anguilla that existed up until from 1650, when it was settled initially, to 1825.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut in 1825, Britain decided just to throw some of the smaller islands together to form a single colony. Anguilla would be treated as one part of a multi-island colony, along with St. Kitts, which is also known as St. Christopher, and eventually with Nevis, with St. Kitts in administrative control of the union. Suddenly Anguilla went from essentially independent self-governance to having to answer to St. Kitts for everything.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nWithout consulting the people of Anguilla, Britain decided to lump it with St. Kitts and Nevis.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Don Walicek he studies Caribbean history at the University of Puerto Rico. He says this was a common move for the British in the Caribbean.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nJust like it lumped together other countries like Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, Carriacou and Grenada, so there were other examples of this.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut there was one huge problem with lumping Anguilla with St. Kitts.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nThe Anguillians didn’t like the Kittitians.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nIt’s just a match that was never made in Heaven.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSt. Kitts and Anguilla were two very, very different islands with very different relationships with Great Britain.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nOne of the gripes that the Anguillian people had was that the aid that came to the colony always ended up in St. Kitts. So that St. Kitts had electricity, and running water, and telephones, and the things that we spoke about that Anguilla didn’t have.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nAnd at the time, Anguilla’s leaders were calling for things like piers and a better port.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere was a story going around at the time that the leader of St. Kitts had been given money by Britain to build a much needed Anguillian pier. But instead of building it on Anguilla-', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nHe actually built the pier in St. Kitts and called it the Anguilla pier.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTension between the two islands simmered for over a century until 1967, when Britain made a decision that would turn their feud into an open conflict. Rather than separating the two islands, as Anguillians wanted, the British government decided that St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla wouldn’t be a single colony anymore, but an official, self-governing associated state with St. Kitts in charge. Which, I know, basically sounds like the same thing. But Hodge says this arrangement was much worse.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nAt least with the colony status, they could complain to somebody, they could complain to Britain. But after that, they would have nobody to complain to.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnguillians were now entirely at the mercy of St. Kitts. And they started protesting immediately. The entire police force on Anguilla was made up of 17 Kittitians and they became the symbol of Kittitian authority. So in February of 1967, Anguillian rebels rounded up all 17 officers and booted them off the island.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nThey took the police, they took their weapons, and they put them onto the vessels and shipped them off to St. Kitts. And said, “Well, we are forever free of you. And we are separate and independent from you.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis was the first act in the Anguillian revolution. One of many revolutions that were happening throughout the British Empire at the time.', '[JAMAICA BECOMES THE FIRST NATION IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE TO GAIN INDEPENDENCE.]', '[AUGUST THE 15TH, 1947 INDEPENDENCE DAY FOR INDIA.]', '[THESE ARE AMONG THE LAST PICTURE HAS TO BE TAKEN IN THE CAPITAL OF THE GOLD COAST. BUT WHEN THIS DAY IS OVER…]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd now Anguilla too, was declaring their independence, kind of.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nThe Anguilla Revolution in 1967 caused a lot of historians and others to scratch their heads.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause Anguilla was calling for independence from St. Kitts and dependence on Great Britain. The island wanted to go back to being ruled directly by the British.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nReally and truly what the Anguillians had asked for was to be ruled directly from Britain.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey figured it was better to be loosely ruled by a country, half a world away then tightly policed by your next-door neighbor. As all this was going on, a young Emily Oberman and her family were on one of their trips to Anguilla. Emily’s father Marvin learned about the conflict over breakfast, when he overheard two men recounting a raid on the police station.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nThey said that there was an attack on the police station. And one of the guys apparently was very proud that he had shot two bullets. But the police station was closed at the time. So there was… He was just shooting two bullets at an empty building.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCurious, Marvin Oberman started asking around.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nWhat were these guys talking about? Why would there be a raid on the police station? What’s going on?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHe was eventually introduced to a man named Jeremiah Gumbs, who was able to explain the revolution. Because he was involved.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nI mean Jeremiah Gumbs, I say, Jeremiah Gumbs was a colossus.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Alan Gumbs, son of Jeremiah Gumbs.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nHe was as strong as any man I’ve known. Physically, the closest thing to his physical statue was the American athlete Jim Brown. But I mean, he was like solid steel and, he can run, and can do everything in the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJeremiah had moved away to the U.S. In his twenties, but had come back to Anguilla with his wife, Lydia, to open up a hotel. He didn’t have any official role in the government, but he became deeply involved in the politics of the island. They even gave him the nickname, The Roving Ambassador.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nHe was very involved in where the revolution was going and how it was going to be handled. And I think he had a better eye for even publicity.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJeremiah and Lydia knew that if this revolution was going to capture people’s imagination, they needed a good flag.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nThe original idea was for Anguilla to… It was going to break away. And so they had to have a flag.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt isn’t entirely clear whether the Gumbs reached out to Marvin, or if Marvin reached out to them. But one way or another Emily’s father helped create a whole new flag for a whole new political future.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nThe idea behind the flag was that he wanted it to be incredibly simple.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs any good flags should be. Marvin drew inspiration from the colors of the island itself.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nPretty much wherever you are on Anguilla, you can see this beautiful turquoise of water. And the idea of there being a long band across the bottom certainly felt like what a flag should have. In the vocabulary of flags, there should be a big wide band of something and an iconic image of something else.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLydia Gumbs and Marvin settled on three colors: white, blue, and orange. White for peace and tranquility, the blue base representing the surrounding sea, and also faith and hope. And the three orange dolphins at the center, which symbolized endurance, strength, and unity in a perpetual circle. You know, the recycling circle. Marvin coordinated with Lydia from his office in New York and mocked up a prototype. But since he was technically working for a government in revolt, he had some concerns.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nMy father was so nervous about designing this flag. He was petrified that he was being followed by the FBI because he was working for a foreign government in revolt. So he was sure that MI5 was following him, or the FBI. And he would keep the shades drawn in his office. And it was actually hilariously charming.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt turns out that the FBI had very little interest in Marlin’s flag project, and he was able to get the prototype printed without issue.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nAnd they made the flag, which my father then wrapped in something, wrapped in something, and brought to Jerry and Lydia Gumbs. And that was the first flag.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nThe flag with the three dolphins, that flag certainly caught on and it has remained loved and beloved by the Anguillian people.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe flag was raised over the administrative office, along with the Union Jack, a clear declaration of independence, and dependence at the same time.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nAs a graphic designer, my father had been really proud of the work that he had done for the island.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Alan Gumbs remembers it a different way.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nIt was my mother, was the art… had the imagination. And she was the one that came up with the three dolphins. And there was somebody that helped her draw it. And that was it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGumbs is positive that his mother, Lydia, was actually the designer of the famous dolphin flag of Anguilla.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nIf she wasn’t, then she might’ve been working with Mr. Oberman, not impossible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMost Anguillians who know the revolutionary history will probably tell you that Lydia designed the flag. While flag nerds who read the September 1991 issue of the Flag Bulletin will probably tell you that Marvin was the designer. The truth may actually lie somewhere in between. But as a successful graphic designer herself, Emily has a healthy perspective on the debate.', 'Emily Oberman:', '\\nI have always believed. And I usually think about this in terms of my team. But I can say this in terms of clients as well. To me, a project that is successful is one where everyone who worked on the project thinks that they were 100% responsible for it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRegardless of who designed it, the Anguillians had a flag and a revolutionary spirit. But they were still stuck in this confusing tangle of colonial bureaucracy since they were fighting for independence from St. Kitts, but not from Great Britain. Revolutionary leaders tried to negotiate a direct relationship with Britain, but Britain refused to deal with Anguilla without going through St. Kitts first. Anguilla did not want to do that. And so the tension just continued to escalate. But even with this tension, it remained a bloodless conflict.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nThe man who eventually became known as the father of the nation in Anguilla, Ronald Webster said, “Oh, the revolution was really a war of words.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHere’s Don Walicek again.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nHe meant that he won a lot of battles with words, with threats, with conversations with reporters.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe media was captivated by the story of this tiny island in a territorial dispute with one of the most powerful nations in the world.', 'Ronald Webster:', '\\n“One can only die once. He can only die once, and we are prepared to die for our freedom.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is the voice of revolutionary leader, Ronald Webster, who, along with Jeremiah Gumbs, petition the United Nations to back the Anguillian cause. They failed to convince the UN, but their story was in papers all over the world.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nThe press were now following my father. Because Anguilla had become “the mouse that roared” and they were in the New York Times every day for months.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n“The Mouse That Roared” was a satirical novel by Leonard Wibberley, about a tiny nation that declares war on the US. The reporters couldn’t help but see an ironic similarity between the two situations. Anguilla was this surprisingly ferocious island that refused to back down.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nAnguilla was this small place lurking in the corner that no one thought could produce such a giant powerful political movement. And it surprised everybody. Their movement was heard all over the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMore than anything, the revolution marked a huge shift in what it really meant to be an Anguillian. And it united Anguillians behind a single purpose, under a single flag. But despite this new unity, St. Kitts still had the power, and they were withholding everything from postcards to pensions. The leader of St. Kitts, Robert Bradshaw, even reportedly said, “I must get Anguilla back on their knees.” And Britain had no intention of separating the two islands and Anguillians were losing their patience.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nThey realized they were being strung along and they realized that Britain wasn’t particularly invested in allowing them to determine their own destiny.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo in February of 1969, two years after Anguilla declared independence from the associated state. It took a more drastic step and declared independence again, but this time it was from the British. As a tiny nation with no diplomatic recognition this was an incredibly risky move. But Anguillians voted 1,739 to four to end all ties with Great Britain. The Union Jack that had flowed alongside the dolphin flag since the start of the revolution was taken down because they decided they would rather try to make it entirely on their own bend to have any connection with St. Kitts.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nThey will never negotiate that. They said they will never be part of the associated state, end of discussion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Britain wasn’t ready to let go. And they attempted a last-ditch effort to save the associated state. They sent a British representative to Anguilla, named William Whitlock to try to negotiate with the Anguillians.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nYou have to understand you’re dealing with the dead and dying vestiges of the British Empire. They didn’t necessarily send their brightest people out to the Caribbean.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe accounts of what happened next tend to vary, depending on whether you’re asking an Anguillian or a British person, but according to Walicek, the Anguillians welcomed Whitlock at the airport with a stirring rendition of God Save The Queen. And as a sign of respect to Whitlock, Ronald Webster, the Anguillian leader came dressed to the nines.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nHe was actually wearing… What do you call it? A dinner coat? A very formal sort of… I’m not British. Right? This thing that British people know what it is, right? He’s dressed in this… Like, it had a tail.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut the courtesy wasn’t returned. Apparently Whitlock blew off an invitation to have lunch with Webster and instead ate with another British official stationed on the island. Feeling disrespected, the Anguillians asked Whitlock to leave the island.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nBut he says, “Well, you can’t throw… I represent the Crown, so you can’t throw me… You can’t tell me to leave.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut the Anguillians were having none of it.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nI believe they fired some guns into the air to signal that they were serious.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhitlock jumped on a plane with his tail between his legs and headed straight back to Britain.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nWhitlock was humiliated. He shared his humiliation with his peers and his superiors. It’s not really clear if he exaggerated what happened but he really portrayed the islanders as villains who were extremely violent and about to kill him.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBritain decided the only way to respond was by mounting a full-scale invasion to restore order.', 'Alan Gumbs:', '\\nSo the British invasion… Such as you want to call it actually occurred. They sent a frigate down there.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nTwo Royal Navy frigates arrived and 330 paratroopers. People talk about seeing Jeeps coming out of the sky.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBritish forces parachuted onto the island and stormed the beaches. Probably expecting armed resistance, but all they found were reporters snapping photos, and some very confused Anguillians. Because the declaration of independence from Britain had been so recent a lot of islanders thought that maybe the British were there to make Anguilla a direct colony, again, like they had originally wanted.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nThere were also locals who thought that the troops were actually there to help them. They thought to themselves, “Oh, they finally came to settle all this ridiculous controversy. We finally have direct colonial relations.” There’s stories that some women were taking food out to the soldiers, a sign of solidarity, and then they realized it was an aggressive invasion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Anguillians didn’t put up any resistance. There was very little violence and certainly no casualties. Once word got out about the so-called invasion of Anguilla, the British became a punchline.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nThe foreign press, the press, the national press all over the world were basically making fun of the British invasion.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe official name of the invasion was Operation Sheepskin, but it later became known by a different name.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nThey call it the Bay of Piglets.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Anguillians allowed British troops to search their homes for weapons, and watched as they replaced the dolphin flag that flew over the administrative office with the Union Jack. Anguilla had been taken without a fight, but in a way, Anguilla won the war.', 'Timothy Hodge:', '\\nAnguilla won the war because it had essentially achieved what it wanted to achieve in the first instance.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt came at the hands of an unnecessary and aggressive invasion, but Anguilla was technically under colonial rule again. And more importantly, they were no longer under the thumb of St. Kitts, which was exactly what they had been originally fighting for. And because the British had gotten themselves into a PR nightmare, they had a lot of damage control to take care of. They started development programs to pave roads all over the island and a new runway for the airport. They also trained a new police force made up of locals. They didn’t just have to make up for a disastrous military move, but for centuries of colonial neglect.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nAnguilla received more support than it ever received in all of the hundreds of years of British colonization. Britain established Anguilla as a colony in 1650. This is 1750 1850, 1950 — 300 years, more than 300 years. So in a matter of a couple of years, it began to have infrastructure, schools, there was a mobile library built. Health professionals were stationed there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnguilla was given the support that it needed to develop its economy and create a thriving tourism industry. It took over a decade to negotiate the terms, but by 1980, Anguilla had achieved full separation from St. Kitts and was officially a direct territory of Great Britain. It isn’t technically correct to say that Anguillians achieved independence. But today the country has its own constitution and government.', 'Don E. Walicek:', '\\nAnguillians describe Anguilla today as independent. And when I first started going there, I kind of thought it was an independent nation. And then finally I started checking things out and then I would go to my Anguillian friends and I’d be like, “Anguilla’s not technically independent?” And they would sort of flare up on me. They’re like, “We had a revolution. We were invaded. We had two declarations of independence.” There’s this parallel, very powerful, and convincing narrative. And maybe, a small place with such a different history. Maybe they should be allowed to have sort of their own understanding of what independence is.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEven though you can still see its presence all over the island today, the dolphin flag of the Republic of Anguilla was only officially flown for about two years. Once Britain invaded, it reverted back to the Union Jack. And then got a completely new flag in 1990. The current design is a blue field with a Union Jack in the upper left canton, with a clashing orange dolphin coat of arms on the right-hand side. Most British overseas territories adhere to this particular style guide. And to be honest, it’s not so good. Those Union Jacks need to go. It’s really only appropriate on the UK flag. But anyway, I digress. The current Anguilla flag is certainly less fun than the dolphin flag created by Marvin Oberman and Lydia Gumbs. But in a way, the design of the current flag is an appropriate, if complicated symbol of what the country is, and what it wanted to be.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up after the break, Kurt Kohlstedt and I are going to talk about the first 99% Invisible book it’s called “The 99% Invisible City.” It comes out October 6th, and we’re going to talk about it, and tell you how you can get a copy or 10. You can get 10 copies. We will not stop you. After this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we have a huge announcement, the first 99% Invisible book is coming out October 6th, 2020. It’s called “The 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to the Hidden World of Everyday Design.” It’s written by Kurt Kohlstedt, our digital director, and me. It’s available for preorder right now. So if you go to 99pi.org/book, you can find all the places you can preorder. And preordering is extremely important to new books, especially by new authors. We’ll talk a little bit more about that later.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut first, I want to tell you about the book itself. It’s both a culmination of the 10 years of stories and the unique world view of the podcast. And it’s this huge leap forward with brand new stories and insights. Literally, everything we cover was researched and written from the ground up. So even if you know the show backwards and forwards, you listen to every single episode, you might recognize a reference to Busta Rhymes Island, for example. But there are whole parts of that section about the process of naming things that were not in the episode. And then there’s all the stuff that we’ve never covered on the show. And we’re just extremely proud of it. It’s designed to be a reading book, like read it cover to cover, but also it has the look and feel of a “field guide” where you can flip through, find entries for the city artifact that’s, you know, maybe sitting right in front of you and read a cool story about why that thing is the way it is.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s beautifully illustrated by Patrick Vale and designed by Rafael Geroni. So it’s both this functional object I want you to use, and read, and carry around with you. But also a precious object that you will like to hold in your hands and look at. So to give you a sense of the stories that we tell in the book, the co-author Kurt Kohlstedt is here and I want us to cover one of the stories that I actually used to pitch the book to publishers in New York when I was out there and as I was describing it, I said, “Well, it’ll be like this travel guide, but it will be to all the mundane, boring things that are in every city. Not any one city in particular, but every city. And it’ll have these entries like a field guide. But in the entry for like a traffic light, for example, it won’t necessarily be the origin story of the traffic light”.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, cause the origin isn’t always the most interesting story about a traffic light or anything else in your city, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExactly.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo we want to focus on the ones that are like not just the best example of, but the coolest story about.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe most interesting traffic light in the world, as far as I’m concerned, happens to be in Syracuse, New York. So what is so strange about the traffic light in the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue in Syracuse, New York?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, really simply, it’s upside down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo the order of lights is reversed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So the green is above the red, which is unusual.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYou always see traffic lights the same way. I mean, sometimes they’re sideways, right? But it’s always green goes up yellow, goes up to red. Like, that’s the stack. It’s just how we do things. But if you think about it, that had to start sometime, right? And so when that started being deployed around the country, it wasn’t like “this is the way things have always been” because there was no precedent.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, it was brand new.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo they landed in this one neighborhood in Syracuse, New York, that happened to be very Irish. And Irish-Americans there saw this as an affront to their culture. You know, they’d never…this was a new phenomenon. Traffic lights were new to the area and they were like, well, why is that Union red on top of the Irish green.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Like, “That’s not the order of things. Green is above red. That’s how things should be.”', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nExactly. And so they did what, you know, anybody would do, I guess. And they just smashed it. They broke and then you’d think, well, that would be the end of the story. They’re going to fix this thing and everything will go back to normal. But no, like, they keep repairing the light and people keep throwing stones at it and breaking it. And it kind of moves all the way up to the state level. There’s all this back and forth. There are these aldermen that come in and say, “Okay. Well, can we negotiate with the city to get this thing to be permanently, you know, upside down? And in the end, kind of remarkably to me, they won. And so to this day, that traffic light is still upside down. But then, you know, it’s one of those stories whereas you dig into it, you find all these fun details. And I love it. Like, if you go there to this spot today, you don’t just see the upside-down traffic light. There’s an entire memorial park on the corner and it’s got, you know, an Irish flag, it’s got this sort of shamrock embedded fence. It’s got these bricks, which you can kind of picture representing, like the bricks that maybe were thrown at the light with the members of, you know, community owners who helped make the park. And then there’s this statue and it’s a statue of a family. And the father is pointing at the light and the son, if you look closely in his back pocket, there’s a slingshot. And, you know, it’s kind of this memorial to this very strange, seemingly low stakes little battle. But that ended up bringing this community together and got everybody really enthusiastic about a traffic light, of all things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so that is indicative of the type of story that we’re telling in the book, in addition to stories about, you know, manhole covers and towers and the grid system and cities and a bunch of things that you may know a little bit about as a regular listener of the show. But a bunch of stuff that I guarantee you do not because when we did the research there was a bunch of stuff that was new to me. And it’s all put together in a new way.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOne of the things I love about the sort of challenge of the book – an opportunity of the book – was to say, well, we have all these stories, but we want to tell a larger story. You know, we want to make this into chapters. We want to tell this overarching story of the city. So the existing episodes that we wanted to include became the kind of framework around which we infield all these other stories to tell a larger story. So we have, you know, a section, for example, on heritage, and it contains certain things that are topics we’ve covered in episodes, but we do it in a kind of order. And we bring you through it so that it tells this larger story about how we think of heritage and old buildings and our built environments.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Like what does all the thinking behind preserving things and keeping things the way they are, restoring them to a certain state and not others or tearing them down even, and how that relates to preservation and heritage. And then the whole book is organized around bigger concepts on the design of cities. But it also functions as a field guide that you can just kind of flip through. If you see something, you can open the entry on, I don’t know, utility graffiti, the little spray paint markings on the street and we’ll tell you, like, what the different colors mean and what that means for what tubes and cables and piping is underneath the street in front of you. But we’ll also tell you the big story of the explosion in Culver City, which codified all of these markings to make sure that the streets were safe when workers were digging underneath the ground. So the book really has all these little ways that you can use it and enjoy it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, I mean, I think that’s the beauty of it, is that we made it so that each story really is independent. Each entry can be read by itself. But if you are interested in that kind of thing, you might go to the next entry and the next and the next, because in a lot of cases, you’ll find that the story keeps going beyond the sort of thing that you’re looking at, at the moment while you’re looking at that entry.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. The joke of it is it’s a field guide to the city. So it’s a field guide to all cities in this way because it has stories from all over the world. But there’s probably some analog in the city that you’re in to the thing that we’re talking about. But we do travel the globe with the book. And one of the things that’s kind of interesting about releasing it in this time period where travel is limited is that if you’re looking to be engaged in the world and you can’t travel, this is actually a beautiful travel guide to the place where you are. You know, you can go outside and find the depth and the history of a thing that is on your corner that maybe you’ve, you know, just ignored before. You’ve never thought about before. But there’s this rich history there. And this book will be your guide to your own city. When you can’t travel right now, you can find all this joy and pleasure and curiosity in the city that you’re in. And that’s, I think, is sort of a beautiful moment to have this book.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, I completely agree, and I’ve been telling people that for a while now, too. It’s just like, you know, you can use this book both to think back to places you’ve been, but even just within a few blocks of your home, you’ll find things that we talk about in this book. I mean, that’s the kind of crazy thing, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt’s like you think this is sort of specific to a place. And our stories are anchored in places.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBut at the same time, they’re kind of placeless.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. They’re real stories that take place in a place. So, like, we take you to Syracuse, New York. We take you to Old Town Warsaw. We take you to Barcelona. Like there’s all these stories in there. But most of these stories lead to big lessons about why the grid is the way it is in your city, even if you’re, you know, 10,000 miles away from the one that we’re talking about. And that’s the nature of the show. It’s very much the nature of the book. And I’m just really proud of how it all came together. And it’s also just like, lovely.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt is really beautiful. And we’re very lucky to be paired with a really talented designer and a really talented and just very hardworking illustrator who went above and beyond in a lot of cases to just bring stories to life and that’s something kind of unique and amazing about the book too, is, you know, normally we can’t show you these things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWe have to walk you through what they look like or, you know, and sometimes that’s an advantage to storytelling, but sometimes it’s really helpful if you could just immediately see on the page, okay, this is what we’re talking about. We don’t really have to describe it any further. We can just jump right into what it means.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So needless to say, we want you to buy the book. And right now, you can preorder it. You can go to 99pi.org/book to find all the relevant links. We also have a link in the show notes. I’ve learned so much about the book publishing industry as we’ve been going through this process. And one of the keys to our success is a large number of preorders. So all the preorders of the book and the first week sales are all collapsed into one number. And that determines if the book premieres on the New York Times bestseller list, for example. And that, of course, is a big deal. But also, the preorders determine if big stores will stock the book and how many copies booksellers will order for their shelves. So you preordering now greatly increases the chances that a person who has never heard of the show will see a copy randomly and flip through it and fall in love with it and buy one. So you, the current 99pi fan who orders right now, are the fuel for that whole engine.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYes. And once you buy one, I mean, you might as well buy two. And if you’re buying two, you could just buy three. I mean, you have family and friends, and they’re nerds.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt comes out October 6th. You could buy 10 and you’re shopping could be done for Christmas or Hanukkah or whatever you celebrate or, like, birthdays. It is a very good gift for all kinds of people who are just curious about the world and especially curious about the world that they live in every day. And so we think this is a lovely evolution of the show. And if the book does well, we might get the opportunity to do more. So 99pi.org/book is the place to go to get your copy the day it comes out on October 6th. Do not wait. Get it today.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOn July 10th, 2015, a police officer in Prairie View Texas pulled over a 28-year-old black woman named Sandra Bland.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nShe was pulled over for turning without signaling, which is a common infraction that police use to stop people in their cars today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Sarah Seo, professor at Columbia Law School', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd the traffic stop quickly turned hostile. There was confrontation between the officer about her smoking in her car. And the officer got upset.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMany of you have probably seen footage of this arrest. It is very disturbing. The officer drags Bland out of the car and threatens her with a taser. He then arrests her and takes her to jail where she tragically dies three days later. Bland’s death was ruled a suicide, but her treatment at the hands of the police sparked outrage across the country. About a year later, the magazine “The Nation” published an article trying to analyze everything that went wrong leading up to her arrest. They focused not just on the incident itself, but her entire life’s history. Her experiences with unemployment, poverty, and mental illness.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd when I read the article in “The Nation” about Sandra Bland’s biography, one thing that stood out to me was every moment in her life where she experienced a setback happened in the context of her car where the police stopped her in her car for a traffic violation, a parking violation that she couldn’t afford to pay and so she sat out in jail, or because the police found marijuana in her car that she was using to self-medicate her mental health issues. And so for me, I saw the car as this important character in itself in the systematic ways that black people are discriminated against, treated unequally in the justice system.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSarah Seo’s new book is called “Policing the Open Road: How Cars Transformed American Freedom” and it’s basically a historical analysis of how we got into this situation—where police have so much power over people in their cars, where black and brown people are stopped and searched disproportionately, and where a minor traffic violation like failing to use a turn signal can have deadly consequences. Seo brilliantly connects the history of modern policing with the history of the car. It’s a riveting read and an important book for this moment and I wanted to talk with Professor Seo about it. We started 100 years ago, at the dawn of the automotive age.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAll of a sudden, there were hundreds and thousands of mass-produced cars on streets that were not meant for them. These streets were intended for pedestrians. Children played in the streets, trolleys, a few horse-drawn carriages that could be afforded by the wealthy. And to suddenly have dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of cars on these streets created chaos and it created traffic.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what did we do to respond to the safety issues that were the result of thousands of cars being thrown onto city streets that were not designed for cars?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nSo we have to think back to a time before the rules of the road became standardized, there was no moral census telling us what are the norms of driving on the road, right? And so local governments, when they addressed the traffic problems, had to set about passing a lot of laws setting forth norms so that everybody drove uniformly because that was the best way to achieve safety on the road.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And there were so many of these new laws that it ended up being pretty confusing, especially because they varied state to state and county to county, and so local governments needed to really work to get people to understand these laws and follow them.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nYeah, and they tried a mix of old ways of responding to social problems while searching for new solutions because a car was an innovation that they had not experienced before. And so some of the old ways that they tried to respond was through private voluntary actions. Ministers in churches gave sermons on safety Sunday, exhorting their congregants to obey traffic laws. They also had schoolboys, preferably Boy Scouts, direct traffic near schools. Washington, D.C. even had women volunteer to manage traffic and report traffic violations. And so some of the old ways of governing relied on private citizens and volunteers to try to maintain order on the streets. But these were ineffective and they were ineffective because average citizens who owned and drove cars refused to obey traffic laws. They kept breaking them. And one of the most common laws that they broke were speeding limits, which was the number one contributing factor to accidents. And so, they realized relying on old ways of governing people, relying on their sense of honor to obey the laws, wouldn’t work. And so they started shifting towards police, law enforcement', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the police at this time were not what we think of today. Police forces were really small, the officers weren’t really trained for the job. They were often in plain clothes and maybe had a little tin star, almost like a nightwatchman or something. And they weren’t really in the business of policing the kind of upper-middle-class, otherwise law-abiding people who were all of the sudden driving around in cars and breaking all these new traffic laws.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nExactly. Exactly. And so what local governments throughout the country realized was that trying to enforce the law against normally law-abiding citizens, the respectable members of society, required somebody with more authority. It required somebody with good judgment, it required somebody who knew the laws, right? To stand head to head and toe to toe with the respectable members of society, even the wealthy ones who drove their cars too fast. And what they realized is that they needed police officers to be professionals.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd so we see because of automobiles, a shift to professionalize and modernize police departments who couldn’t be bribed, who were smart enough to learn all the laws, who were tall enough. There was actually a height requirement so that they can stand above the cars and people could see their directions managing traffic. And so we see how the police profession itself becomes more specialized and exclusive out of necessity, because of the need to discipline drivers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo was the decision to involve the police in all this at all controversial? I mean, today we take for granted that police who enforce traffic laws. But was there any debate about it at the time?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nThere was debate. I mentioned how there was a group of reforming police chiefs who wanted to modernize and professionalize the police. And the person at the forefront of that movement was a police chief named August Vollmer. He was a police chief of Berkeley, California, from 1905 to 1932. And a lot of police scholars today call him the father of modern policing in America. And he firmly believed that the police should not enforce traffic. He also believed that the police should not enforce vice laws because the police as professionals were crime fighters and they should devote their time to fighting and investigating crime, not enforcing traffic laws or vice laws like prostitution or like anti-liquor laws.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Like he didn’t see those as serious crimes worthy of the police’s attention, like it was more of an administrative task than professional police work.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nYeah and the other thing is that traffic quickly came to consume much of the police’s time. It became a large part of their duties, and for the police to enforce the letter of the law against these ordinarily law-abiding citizens proved to be a huge headache because nobody liked being enforced. Nobody liked to be ticketed. Nobody liked to be arrested for a traffic violation. And so what Volmer saw was what he called the respectable citizenry, started turning against the police. And he hated that because police as professionals were owed respect, not disdain. And so what he realized to manage this kind of public relations rule of law problem was to advise his officers, actually exercise your judgment and discretion. And let’s not enforce the law to the letter. Let’s mitigate the harshness of the law. Even if the law says to arrest somebody for a traffic violation, let’s just let them go with a warning. It’s better to manage our relations with the citizenry rather than to antagonize and alienate them. So he definitely saw the challenges of traffic law enforcement that he did not like at all.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Even though his opposition didn’t end up mattering that much. And an interesting irony in the book is that cars actually ended up helping Vollmer achieve his goals of having this modern professional police force. Because so many people were breaking traffic laws that meant that they had to have more police officers on the road, and they needed their own patrol cars, and all the traffic tickets helped pay for it.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nExactly. And what he didn’t entirely anticipate, but what happened pretty quickly, was that American society became a car society. And so a lot of crime was taking place in cars on the road anyway. And so very early on, local and state government officials were realizing that crime-fighting and criminal investigation, a lot of it was happening on the road. And that traffic cops, while they were looking for safety violations, could also look to see if there were evidence of other crimes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd so we see this merging of the duties between traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement and vice enforcement. This is a period, of course, where prohibition, national probation, is in effect. And cars were one of the best ways to transport liquor.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And so this becomes a major Fourth Amendment question. And that’s the amendment that protects against undue searches and seizures. And, you know, we all know – probably from watching tv – that the police need to get a warrant to search your house, but they actually don’t need to get a warrant to search your car. When did that get decided?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nIt’s a question that first comes up in the 1920s at a time when prohibition is in effect and the mass production of cars has really settled in American culture. And the reason why this question of whether the police need a warrant to stop and search a car becomes such a big issue in the 1920s is because bootleggers realized that one of the best ways to transport their illicit liquor is in their cars. And police officers and prohibition agents want to stop cars and search them. And they don’t… they didn’t have time to get a warrant. So they wanted to be able to do that without a warrant. And this is a really hard issue because the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of persons, houses, papers, and effects.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCars obviously weren’t around when the constitution was written, but they could be thought of as ‘effects’ in this scenario. And so this tension emerged during the prohibition era about whether it’s okay for the police to search a car without a warrant if they suspected that people inside were smuggling alcohol. And this tension comes to a head in the courts in 1925 with the Carroll case.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nThe Carroll case was the U.S. Supreme Court’s first car search case. It was decided in 1925. But it actually came before the court in 1923. And they had to argue it again a second time because the issues were so difficult. The way that the case started was with three prohibition agents and a public safety officer from the state of Michigan. They saw a flashy Oldsmobile convertible drive past them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd the officers recognized the car. It belonged to a gang of known bootleggers called the “Caroll brothers” so the police decided to go after it.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nThey didn’t have any evidence at that time that they saw the car, that there was liquor in the car at the time. They just knew that the Carroll brothers were involved in bootlegging. So they stopped the car and they searched it and they couldn’t find anything. They were about to let the Carroll brothers go until one of them hit something hard inside the upholstery of the backseat. So they tore open the upholstery and they found 80 some bottles of liquor sewn into the backseat. The Carol brothers tried to bribe them off but they refused the bribe and they prosecuted the case.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe defense attorneys for the Carroll brothers argued that there was no way for the police to have known in advance that there was liquor in the car, and so the search was illegal under the fourth amendment. And the justices on the court thought that made sense, but they ruled against the Carrol brothers anyway, in a decision that we’re still living with today. They wrote that cars had so thoroughly changed American society that they needed to be treated differently from other forms of property. The court created an automobile exception to the fourth amendment.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd so the new constitutional rule that the U.S. Supreme Court set forth in the 1925 Carroll case is basically still the law today which is if a police officer has probable cause to believe that there’s evidence of a crime inside the car, they can stop the car without a warrant.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis was a huge change. Instead of needing to go before a judge to determine whether there were grounds to make a search, the officer could now make that determination for themselves. If they got sued later on, the police just needed to tell the judge, you know, “I had probable cause because of these set of facts I saw on the road.”', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd what judges and courts have done throughout the 20th century is exercise what critics have called judicial charity. Another way to put it is that courts have often believed the police’s account of probable cause. And so over time, over the 20th century, probable cause has become this very loose standard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe impact of the Carroll case went beyond cars. Forty years later, in Terry vs Ohio, the supreme court legalized “stop and frisk,” and they justified that decision by pointing to Carroll.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nThe Court accepted the logic of Carroll that the fourth amendment had to evolve to be reasonable to meet the circumstances of a modern world, and so it adopted and cited the Carroll decision for that proposition.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe fourth amendment protects against “unreasonable” searches and seizures. But over the course of the twentieth century, what constitutes a “reasonable” search has been pretty hard to pin down', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nFourth Amendment reasonableness analysis has this phrase that comes up a lot in the cases. What is reasonable depends on the totality of the circumstances. Each case has to be decided on its own, case by case. And so when you have each case decided on its own and the police comes before the court testifying as to why he or she acted in this way or that way, a judge is likely to say, you’re right. I can’t judge what you did in hindsight. What you do is a difficult job, often dangerous. I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt. So Fourth Amendment reasonableness determinations have, for the most part, sided with the police. And over time that has just given police a lot of discretionary authority.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd how has this increased discretionary power impacted the racial dynamic in policing?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nSo the interesting thing about the history of discretionary power is that in the early 20th century, discretionary power was seen as a good thing for citizens because an officer who exercised discretion could say, “You violated the speed limit but I’m going to use my discretion to let you off with a warning. Don’t do it again.” But the police exercise their discretion, with respect to the poor and people of color, to pull over black and brown drivers more often than white drivers. They exercise their discretion to search the cars of black and brown drivers more often than white drivers. And oftentimes, and this is based off of a study conducted by the Stanford Open Policing Project, oftentimes they search cars with little suspicion or no suspicion at all when it comes to drivers of color. And so discretion today allows the police to exercise their authority in discriminatory ways.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, and I mean if we go back to the Sandra Bland case, I guess we can’t say for sure if that was racial profiling, but you know…she failed use her turn signal and the officer chose to use that minor infraction as an excuse to go much further. And I guess what’s disturbing about it is that…it’s not really clear that the officer did anything technically illegal.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nYeah, the “New York Times” asked three or four legal scholars to look at the video of the encounter and answer the question, “Was the officer who pulled over Sandra Bland justified in doing what he did?” And they all believed that the officer went too far, but they couldn’t say that definitively because constitutional law allowed almost all of the actions that he took. The officer can make an arrest for a minor traffic violation. That’s reasonable policing. And so the definition of reasonableness has become very broad and capacious.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, that’s the thing that I find sort of amazing about all this stuff happening at once is you have this technology, this thing, the car is created. It takes over American society. And it is a place of diminished Fourth Amendment protections and a place where you can be policed, you know, kind of capriciously because of the litany of rules that you could possibly be breaking at any one moment in which you could be stopped. And so it creates this perfect void where the discretion of the officer just fills that void.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nYeah. And I think an important point is to think about that role in the context of traffic laws. Almost everybody violates some traffic law at some point. Right? Speeding is a common one. So the police officer can choose who to pull over for a traffic violation. Right? And during that traffic stop, they can look for facts amounting to probable cause to search a car. And so you have traffic law enforcement merging with the Carroll rule, which gives police officers a lot of discretionary power if they want to start investigating. And add to that all these other doctrines that have been established over the 20th century with respect to cars. Another area of law is the “consent doctrine,” which is if an officer gets your consent to search your car, then the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply. And so a common scenario is a traffic or a patrol or an officer stops someone for a traffic violation, looks for facts that might amount to probable cause, but also asks, “Can I search your car?” And once they have that, they don’t need probable cause anymore. And a lot of searches are done through consent.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd depending on the disposition of the officer, they can create probable cause because if they react violently and people push back or react at all or stand up for themselves or assert that they have some kind of right in their person or in this space. I mean, this is what happened with the Sandra Bland case. I mean, there’s no reason why he necessarily had to be offended by her having a cigarette, you know, that escalated that incident. And because of that, it escalated to the point that she was arrested and she died. And so, again, it just creates this mess of things where one person has too much power because of this confluence of technology and law and how we police it.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd I would add that critics had predicted this as soon as the 1925 Carol decision came out. Right? There was one critic that said reasonable or probable cause is a standard that allows the police to be wrong in some circumstances. Now, if you have that kind of standard, a police officer can fudge the truth a little bit, maybe even falsify probable cause. So these critics really are already anticipating the abuse that could happen with the probable or reasonable cause standard for warrantless car searches. And we see that today there was a New York state judge last year who complained about the odor of marijuana as this kind of cliche in police accounts of probable cause, because the odor of marijuana is a fact that supports probable cause. But how do you disprove that there was odor of marijuana in the car later in a court of law? It really comes down to whether the judge believes the police officer, that he or she smelled marijuana in the car. There’s nothing else that a person can do to disprove that fact other than to challenge the credibility of the officer. And so this odor of marijuana has become this really common thing that officers will add to their account in the totality of the circumstances to support probable cause.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, one of the things that’s pretty amazing is that, you know, I’m a white man in his 40s. I can afford to hire a good lawyer. And if a police officer pulls behind me in my car while I’m just… what I think of as behaving normally and adhering to the rules, I get scared. You know, like I think I’ve done something wrong or I think there’s the potential that I will do something wrong. And I can’t even imagine what that is like for someone not in my situation, for a black man where the risk is so much higher. Why have we accepted this? Like why have we accepted this dynamic where an individual police officer has so much power over a person in their car?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nI think we accept it. And I think the reason why judges have accepted it is because of the dangers of cars. Cars are really dangerous. Road safety is a big issue. I am scared of drunk drivers. They’re a huge problem on the road. Right? I want to be protected by the state. That is a legitimate function of the government. It’s just that because we’ve delegated that task to the police that also handles criminal enforcement, that’s caused so much of the problems we see today. And so I think part of the answer to your question of why haven’t we questioned the police enforcement of traffic laws is, I think, goes back to traffic safety is a huge deal. But we can question whether the police are the right institution to handle that or not.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up after the break, we’re going to take a look at a city that is doing just that, separating traffic enforcement from its police department. After this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo the town I live in, Berkeley, California… I live in Berkeley. The headquarters is in beautiful downtown Oakland, California, but I live in Berkeley. It was also the home of the police chief, August Vollmer, the so-called father of modern policing. Actually, he lived around the corner from my house. But as Sara Seo talks about in her book, Vollmer was not a fan of the idea that police should be in charge of enforcing traffic laws. He did not consider rolling through a stop sign to be a crime worthy of the police’s attention. So 100 years later, the city of Berkeley has made a decision that August Vollmer might have approved of.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, so in July of 2020, Berkeley City Council passed this big omnibus motion related to policing and one of the strategies in there had to do with traffic.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s producer Emmett FitzGerald. Hello, Emmett!', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nHey.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo explain what actually happened there.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo the Council is basically beginning the process of taking traffic enforcement out of the hands of its police department. They voted to create a new body, the Department of Transportation or BerkDOT, as they’re calling it, which, you know, in addition to doing all the things like traffic engineering and more structural stuff, would also administer the rules of the road. And, you know, this is very much in the early stages. But that’s the intention. That’s what they’re setting out to do. And one thing that I found so interesting is that the whole idea for this proposal was actually inspired in part by Sarah Seo’s book.', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nWe were influenced by Sarah Seo’s book because I think what it brought forward is this idea that it doesn’t have to be this way.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Barnali Ghosh. She’s a transportation advocate here in Berkeley. She’s on the coordinating committee of a community organization called “Walk Bike Berkeley” and is the chair of the Berkeley Transportation Commission, which is a body that advises Berkeley City Council on transportation issues. And Ghosh says that one of her colleagues at Walk Bike Berkeley actually heard Sarah Seo speak on another podcast, “The Great War on Cars” podcast. Check it out. And that got them interested in all this history, and particularly in August Vollmer.', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nYou know, Vollmer, who was seen often as the father of modern policing — all kinds of issues with him — but even he, even the father of modern policing, didn’t think that traffic enforcement should be part of the police department. And that’s something we also learn from Sarah Seo’s book.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, I mean, I was totally riveted by that section and thought it was just kind of remarkable.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. And that just got Ghosh and the folks at Walk Bike Berkeley and other community groups thinking, like, does it have to be this way?', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nI think for a long time we all took it for granted that, of course, police is going to do traffic enforcement. But if you actually think about it, the more we shared this idea with people, it becomes quite clear that you don’t need armed police to ticket somebody who might have stepped off the curb a few minutes before the light change.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd, you know, Ghosh has been working on transit issues for a long time. You know, questions of safety and how we can redesign our cities to make them safer and rely less on cars. And she says that enforcement has always been a major obstacle for getting everyone in the community on board.', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nWe do have a lot of anger against cars, which are dangerous. You know, we are upset when people pass from the bike lane and enforcement is seen as a tool to create safe streets. But we as transportation advocates are really tired of using transportation safety as a way to stop people. The folks in our community, especially black community members, were telling us, “We do not want more police in our neighborhoods so you can have safety.” So we were already beginning to think about what safety looks like from an inclusive perspective. So not just not getting hit by a car, but also not being harassed by police. When you’re out walking in the street.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so Berkeley has created this new Department of Transportation that theoretically will oversee traffic enforcement. But what is that like specifically? Like who will be the person who, like, stops someone to give them a speeding ticket?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYes. I asked Barnali Ghosh about this. And again, it’s the very, very early stages of this. And so there is no concrete answer to that. But she gave me the analogy of a building inspector.', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nSo if a building inspector is coming in to check if you are up to code, they’re not carrying a gun to enter your house, you know, expecting that they might find drugs. So why is it okay then, to use a violation of traffic safety to escalate to something more than that?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s a good metaphor. So something like the building inspector but for traffic is the thing.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. I think something kind of like that. An unarmed person who is an expert in traffic and transportation issues and crucially, and this is an interesting part of the conversation, crucially, Ghosh said the person that could also, you know, be a part of the effort to engineer and make our streets better so that person could use, you know, in responding to a specific incident, they’re also able to help provide data on what went wrong from the perspective of urban design.', 'Barnali Ghosh:', '\\nThey will be able to report back to BerkDOT, to the Department of Transportation, on what are some of the infrastructural issues that might be causing people to… are they not able to see the stop sign? Is there a tree branch blocking it? Right? So we hope that it can be somebody who is thinking, whose main priority is traffic safety, not looking for crime.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd Ghosh really emphasized this a lot in our conversation, that the traffic enforcement should always be done in conjunction with better design and engineering. So anytime you have a violation, you ask, like, is there something about the way that these streets are designed that could have prevented this?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So, like, instead of the way we’re doing this right now where policing is totally distinct from planning and engineering and design. It’s just a layer added on top of all that stuff. They do not talk to each other at all.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. And Ghosh is like very bullish on this that, you know, so many traffic problems are really design problems and that we can reduce the amount of enforcement that is needed really dramatically if these different agencies work together and share data and design streets that are safe streets.', 'Roman Mars: So in our interview, I asked Sarah Seo about this new policy in Berkeley, and she said that she thinks it’s really exciting and that it’s a great way to reduce your bad interactions between the public and the police because traffic stops are the number one way that people come into contact with law enforcement.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nAnd I think this makes a lot of sense for several reasons. One is that the police today are trained in what is called the “warrior mentality” because they are trained to deal with criminal suspects, to investigate crime, to pursue criminal investigations. They tend to see a lot of their encounters in that warrior mentality, which is not necessarily appropriate to traffic law enforcement when it’s supposed to be a routine administrative task. I think that the history that I tell in my book points to some difficulties with this proposal or some challenges to this proposal that have to be addressed.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what are some of those logistical difficulties?', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nThe argument that I make in my book is that the police became professionalized. They became modernized. They gained a lot of discretionary power because of the challenges of enforcing traffic laws on the general public. I saw this history repeat itself in the 1990s New York City experiment with meter maids where New York City has these traffic agents that are not police officers and they’re informally called meter maids and they issue citations for low-level offenses, mostly parking violations. And they realize the same thing that traffic cops in the 1920s and 30s realized. Enforcing traffic laws on the general public is a really hard task. And they got a lot of abuse. They were actually assaulted. And so what they wanted, what they lobbied for was to have the status and the authority of police officers because they thought if I have the power of a police officer, then the public won’t abuse me or assault me when I’m directing traffic.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so basically in New York City, they did everything they could to make meter maids more like police officers in the end. So they gave them blue uniforms and they gave them more power. And in the case, they kind of reinvented the police.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, and then you end up in a situation that looks an awful lot like the one you were trying to get away from.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Sarah says that if Berkeley is going to create this new class of traffic enforcer, the city is really going to have to work hard on public education and buy-in so that that type of power and force is not required in this new enforcement body.', 'Sarah Seo:', '\\nSo I think if the public understands the direct connection between their cooperation with traffic agents and society’s reliance on policing. Then that could go a long way towards not having to fall back into the cycle of increasing the discretionary authority of whoever it is that enforces traffic laws.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s the really early stages of all this, but I think it’s really exciting that people are trying to shake things up and try new things.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, yeah. And quite interesting. I mean, it’s cool to me to see Berkeley sort of at the center of all this history going back 100 years and now coming full circle.', 'Roman Mars: Yeah. It’s like, it’s almost poetic that it’s happening here when it all kind of started here. This is so cool. Well, thanks so much for bringing this and adding this to the interview.

THE ONLY FURNITURE BUSINESS IN INDIANA AND OUR PRICES ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD.]', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut if you grew up in Toronto in the 1980s, you probably know our local supermarket guy, Dave Nichol. By contrast, he was extremely low key.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s producer, and notable Canadian, Chris Berube.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nDave Nichol might be the most milk-toast guy to appear on television. He had these big wireframe glasses and this dome of brown hair and a prominent Southern Ontario accent.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\n“In the past few weeks, there’s been a lot of shouting about lower grocery prices. Recently, the major newspapers in Toronto and Ottawa, compared prices at the major supermarkets. In both surveys, Loblaws had the lowest prices.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn the ’80s, Nichol helped run a grocery store chain called Loblaws, which makes me giggle just to say it. They had an inexpensive line of products they called the “No Name” brand which Nichol would sell in a series of sleep-inducing commercials.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\n“For example, these brand name pickles are almost twice as expensive as No Name, why is it then that in many supermarkets you find the national brand in one aisle…”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIn these ads, Nichol would sit on a stool in front of a black background and he would just talk, that was it. Though, sometimes for added excitement, he’d include his dog in the ad.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\n“This is not ET, this is Georgie Girl, and she’s a French bulldog.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThese discount ads were part of a strategy. The ads were notably plain, just like the products because No Name had basically no package design.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you bought No Name cookies, here’s what you get, a box with some cookies inside. Which, I guess that’s what you always get. But in this case, the box had a plain background with black text, that said, “chocolate chip cookies.” And that was it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThere was No Name peanut butter, No Name detergent, No Name orange juice. All of it was dirt cheap. And Loblaws wasn’t unique, it was one of the many supermarket chains across North America that was riding a generic product craze in the late ’70s and the early ’80s.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Loblaws took it further than anyone. Their generic marketing plan changed the way we eat and shop. And ironically, their strategy to go brandless became one of the most successful branding campaigns. About a hundred years ago, we really didn’t have supermarkets. If you went shopping, you had to go to the greengrocer and the butcher, and then someone delivered your milk, and it was so, so time-consuming. But in 1916, Clarence Saunders opened a store in Tennessee called “Piggly Wiggly” which was the first place with self-service groceries, rows and rows of products that you could pick out yourself. Soon, America was overrun with grocery stores', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAfter World War II, these stores were filled with famous national brands. A couple of factors helped the big brands take over, like the new interstate highway system which made it easy to deliver goods. And of course, the rise of television.', '[WHEN THE LOOK ON THE FACE IS HAPPY, THE NAME ON THE BOTTLE MUST BE HEINZ KETCHUP, THE RED MAGIC.]', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nThink about the cereal aisle, soft drinks, cleaning detergents, Proctor & Gamble, Nabisco, General Foods. Those were the biggest advertisers in the postwar era. They really are the big spenders, and the big spenders were the brands most people wanted.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis is my favorite marketer, Terry O’Reilly.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nAnd I am the host of “Under The Influence” which is a CBC radio show and podcast. And I am a 40-year ad man.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nO’Reilly says, back at the advent of TV, telling people about your new product was pretty easy, if you had the money to buy commercials on the biggest shows.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nThere was a time when you could buy the Ed Sullivan Show and Bonanza, and maybe Gunsmoke, back in the ’60s. And by buying just those three programs, you would be reaching 80% of America and Canada.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe name brands became dominant. They were most of what people bought at grocery stores in North America.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTo fill up the shelves, supermarkets would make their own store brand products too. Often, these look kind of like the big brands with the name of the supermarket slapped on the side of the box.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nStore brands were mostly popular with people who wanted a low-budget alternative to the name brand stuff.', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nThey wanted to buy something that was not as good, but not as expensive.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis is Stephen Hoch, he’s an Emeritus marketing professor at the Wharton School. And he says, store brands weren’t always the highest quality, but many of them were close enough to the name brands, mainly because a lot of grocery store products are easy to make. Take for example, corn flakes.', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nWhat did you need? You need some machine that can spit out corn batter and into some machine that nukes it and all of a sudden it’s a cornflake. So, there’s always a bunch of manufacturers that can do it. And for instance, shampoo, anybody can make shampoo. All you need is a bathtub and some chemicals and some bottles.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut the store brands weren’t big sellers until they received a boost in the late 1970s.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAfter the oil crisis, the global economy went into a recession. Unemployment hit 11% and suddenly middle-class families didn’t have money for name brands like Coke or Kellogg’s. Consumers wanted cheaper food.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIn response, there was a new demand for low-cost store brands. One chain in France called Carrefour was developing one of these discount brands when they had this idea, instead of using bright colors or putting their name on the box or using slogans – you know, branding – their products would be brand-less. Just the name of the food in black text on a white background. This minimalist design was a brilliant marketing tool. It delivered the message that “This is cheap, we’re cutting costs, and we are passing the savings down to you.”', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nThis is bare-bones and you’re having a hard time coping here because maybe you’re unemployed or whatever. And so, here’s a way that you can substitute away from a more expensive product and still satisfy your kids. When they wake up in the morning, they want some cereal for breakfast.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1976, Carrefour launched the new product line, which they called “Les Produits Libres,” which means in English, “free products” which, you know, they weren’t actually free, but these products were 20 to 30% cheaper than everything else at the store.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd it worked. Soon, the Produits Libres were a hit. Grocery store executives from North America were actually flying to Europe just to check out Carrefour and see what the hype was about. Soon, the Produits Libres idea was being copied by everybody. Steven Hoch says, “At first, it was a bit of a shock.”', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nI just had moved to Chicago, and the big grocery chain there was called Jewel. I remember going in the store, and all of a sudden I saw these black and white packages. It was black type on a white package, for every single one of those thing. So it said “napkins,” and that was it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like a minimalist’s heaven. Chain stores like Jewel in Chicago and Ralph’s in California were packaging and selling their own generic products. In many stores, the generic products were given a separate aisle. This helped promote their novelty, but it also prevented shoppers from comparing them side-by-side, with the nicer looking brand name products.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut one Canadian grocery store took this idea of generic branding to a whole new extreme. And the catalyst was the man a lot of Canadians knew from local TV ads, the president of Loblaws supermarkets, Dave Nichol.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDave Nichol wasn’t born rich, but he was a man of refined tastes. He went to Harvard Law School, he loved to fly first class, and he personally knew the chefs at many of the three-star restaurants in Europe.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nDave Nichol was friends with Galen Weston, who was from one of the richest families in Canada. The Weston’s owned Loblaws and they tapped Dave Nichol to help run the company, even though he had no experience running a supermarket.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt the time, Loblaws was in a really bad place. They were trailing way behind their competitor, the grocery chain Dominion. Loblaws was closing stores, laying off workers, the only thing Loblaws had going for it was a celebrity pitchman, named William Shatner.', 'William Shatner:', '\\n“Hey, right now, Loblaws is having a huge frozen food sale. Frozen vegetables, frozen meat entrees, frozen concentrated juices, ice cream. If it’s frozen, you can save plenty. Don’t get left out in the cold…”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nNichol saw the low sales and the stores closing, and he decided we need to change things up. So Loblaws took Carrefour’s discount branding idea and they ran with it. They launched No Name. It was just like the black and white generics you could find in America and Europe, but the Loblaws products had one big design flourish.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\nWe hired a great designer named Don Watt, who just chose yellow – stark, banana yellow – and just big chunky Helvetica type. Yellow feels like a discount color, I guess like its cousin orange. And I think Don Watt really chose yellow because it was a color least used by big brands. It was almost like Orwellian, no romance in it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nBut Nichol didn’t just launch the product line, he made it an entire store.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe worst performing Loblaws stores were shut down and rebranded as No Frills. These new stores carried very few name brands, it was dominated by No Name products. To make this painfully clear, the entire store was painted black and bright yellow.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe first No Frills opened in Toronto in 1978. Dave Nichol was actually doing a TV interview, when he found out what certain customers thought about the color scheme.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\n“What do you think the problem is?”', 'Customer:', '\\n“The color outside is lousy.”', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\n“What do you think about the prices? Have you checked the prices?”', 'Customer:', '\\n“No, I haven’t checked the prices.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIt was a real bargain bin experience. People had to bag their own groceries. And while the products were cheaper, some customers expressed ambivalence about the new store.', 'Reporter:', '\\n“There’s no butcher, no bakery, no frozen food, no air conditioning, no fancy displays and not even much choice of products. But what it does have is customers.”', 'Reporter:', '\\n“How do you like packing, having to pack your own bag?”', 'Customer:', '\\n“I don’t like it.”', 'Customer:', '\\n“It’s all right, I didn’t know I was supposed to have a bag. I’ll bring my own next time.”', 'Reporter:', '\\n“You’d come back next time?”', 'Customer:', '\\n“Oh well, of course.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nWhen the new store opened, Dave Nichol had replaced William Shatner as the face of the company. And he launched the bland new ad campaign, which sent a pretty clear message about what Loblaws was offering.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nYou don’t have to pay for the mass advertising and all the design work and all the marketing that goes on behind that jar of jam. All you should be paying for is the jam. And Nichol called that “brand tax.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe new stores were a success. It turns out a lot of consumers didn’t want to pay the brand tax. They didn’t want the bells and whistles. And in America, by the early 1980s, billions of dollars in generic products were being sold every year.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAs they got more popular, it’s clear that generic products were becoming exactly the thing they were supposed to be rebelling against.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nThe No Name brand is a brand.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSurprise!', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nIt is presented to the public as a non-brand, meaning a viable choice to big-name brands. But in itself, a generic product is a brand. You’re appealing to people or to shoppers, who think that people who do pay for big brands are foolish when you could have the same thing and just not pay for the advertising, not pay for the fancy label.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe generic brand was so powerful, by the early eighties, it was showing up on the fringes of pop culture. In the sci-fi movie “Repo Man,” it was used as this great visual joke, about how the world is becoming more and more conformist. In the movie, Emilio Estevez works in a grocery store that is slowly crushing his soul, and only stocks generic products. In one scene, Estevez eats out of a can simply labeled “Food”.', '[MOTHER: PUT IT ON A PLATE, SON. YOU’LL ENJOY IT MORE.]', '[OTTO: I COULDN’T ENJOY IT ANYMORE, MOM. MMMM-MMM-MMM.THIS IS SWELL.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGeneric products were featured in a music video by the band Suicidal Tendencies. And there was a whole series of books, thrillingly called “No Frills Books”.', 'Terry Bisson:', '\\nI thought of it as a satire on publishing, if you could have No Frills corn flakes, why couldn’t you have a No Frills romance?', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis is Terry Bisson who edited the series, which was not affiliated in any way with the No Frills store, but the cover was black and white to make it look like those generic grocery products.', 'Terry Bisson:', '\\nIt’s a No Frills book mystery, and then it says, “Complete with everything: detective, telephone, mysterious woman, corpses, money, rain. And the science fiction is complete with everything: aliens, giants, ants, space cadets, robots, one plucky girl.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe No Frills series got positive reviews, including a feature in the New York Times book section.', 'Terry Bisson:', '\\nThey got this enormous press attention because every newspaper in the country, in those days, had a book editor or somebody that was supposed to look at your stuff. Well, they all thought it was a hoot.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThere was also a script for a No Frills movie, which never got produced because you can only take this joke so far. In the early ’80s, generics were a phenomenon, but the novelty couldn’t last. And while the branding was clever, it couldn’t hide the fact that some generic products… well, they just weren’t very good.', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nThe toilet paper, I mean, it was… it just wasn’t, it just didn’t work doing its job. You know?', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nStephen Hoch says this happened with A LOT of generic products.', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nI tried a few things and they really just weren’t… It wasn’t worth it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd he wasn’t alone in that opinion. Jim White was an executive at Loblaws.', 'Jim White:', '\\nOn April 4th, 1984, I joined Dave Nichol. And Dave was always going on TV, pitching No Name products. He was pitching the yellow and black product line. All of them being inferior to the national brands. And their only benefit was, that they were cheaper than the national brand, but it took me a couple of months to figure out that No Name was no bueno.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTo bring down the price for generics, some supermarkets were cutting corners. Shoppers were finding cans full of bruised peaches in the generic section.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nI think nothing will kill a product faster than good marketing. So if you’ve got great marketing on your generic brands, and then people are drawn to try it and it tastes terrible, nothing will kill a product faster than that.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nNow, to be clear, not all generic products were bad. Many of the generics were the same product as the brand names, just in different packaging. Loblaws actually used taste tests for their No Name products, but a couple of low-quality generics spoiled the whole bunch for a lot of customers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe recession ended. And when the unemployment rate dropped, people went right back to the brand names. In a lot of ways, generic branding was out of step with the culture of the 1980s.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nThat was really the era of over-exuberance and yuppieness and BMWs and big salaries and fancy clothes and electronics. I think that era, for whatever reason in the ’80s, was about spending money.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nWith consumerism dominating culture, buying generics became embarrassing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLots of American supermarkets gave up on the generic experiment, but in Canada, Loblaws didn’t get rid of No Name. They just moved it lower down the shelf and they created a second product to attract the yuppies.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nHere’s Jim White again.', 'Jim White:', '\\nI think what in my own mind was, I wanted to go after the more affluent shopper. We should create the first premium private label program in North America. It didn’t exist, it only existed in my head.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo, premium private label is another term for a nicer quality store brand. Basically, Loblaws wanted to make a store brand that was affordable, but felt luxurious. Jim White remembers talking about it with his boss, Dave Nichol.', 'Jim White:', '\\nHe said, “What do you think we should call it?” And I… this guy Dave, had a very large ego. He was very, very pleased with himself. And knowing that, I simply said to him, “I think we should call it President’s Choice.” And then he rose and he said, “Yes. Do it.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe packages for President’s Choice were definitely nicer to look at. They were also designed by Don Watt and his team, and they used lots of color. They had these pictures on the front, that resembled the photos in Gourmet magazine. Oh, and the logo was the words “President’s Choice” in Dave Nichol’s handwriting.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe products even had fancy names. They didn’t carry macaroni and cheese, they had white cheddar deluxe macaroni and cheese, that’s deluxe with an “E”. Their Oreo imitator was called Lucullan Delights, named after the hedonist Roman general, Lucullus. They eventually had to change the name on that one because nobody understood the reference.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nDave Nichol was still doing TV ads and talking directly to customers, but now, instead of focusing exclusively on rock bottom prices, Nichol also talked about his world travels in search of gourmet flavors.', 'Dave Nichol:', '\\nEvery year I take two or three extended trips, let’s say to Singapore or to Bali. And usually, because of the length of the distances, we layover in Hong Kong. And so, I’ve spent a lot of time eating in the restaurants of Hong Kong, and I think one of the flavors that has always intrigued me…', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLoblaws was spending a lot of money on research and development so that their new food would live up to all these fancy product names. Jim White even spent months trying to make the perfect chocolate chip cookie.', 'Jim White:', '\\nIt took nine months just to make the chocolate.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd this new super-cookie, would be called “The Decadent.”', 'Jim White:', '\\nAnd then we launched it, and history was made.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nIt seems so odd to say that in hindsight, that a cookie could be so powerful in the marketing of an entire grocery chain, but it happened. So, if you tasted that cookie at that time, it was mind-blowing.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe Decadent quickly became a bestseller. And soon, Dave Nichol and his Loblaws’s team were hired to develop new fancy store brands for big supermarkets across America.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nHe was eventually revered across North America as a great grocery merchandiser and marketer because even Sam Walton hired Dave Nichol to come and consult on his private label brands. Even a company as big as Walmart was trying to pick Dave Nichol’s mind at that stage.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nWalmart rolled out its own version of President’s Choice, called Sam’s Choice. And after leaving Loblaws, Jim White helped create premium private labels all over the world.', 'Jim White:', '\\nWegmans and Walmart and Safeway and Vons and Stop & Shop and Finest and Fred Meyer and Myers. I created products for all of them.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nToday, one in four products sold in American supermarkets are store brand. And that’s partly because more of those store brands follow the President’s Choice model.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese products all have colorful packages and aspirational names, like “Signature Farms” or “Market Cafe.” They look fancier, even if they cost less than the national brands.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe message for generic products used to be, “this product is just good enough.” Now, the message is, “you were a discerning shopper, who’s looking for a more curated product experience.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEntire supermarkets like Trader Joe’s are built around this principle. Here’s Stephen Hoch.', 'Stephen Hoch:', '\\nIf you kind of look at store brands versus national brands, store brands are giving the national brands in most product categories a real run for their money. And the reason why is because they’re just about as good.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThe minimal generic products, the ones that just say cereal on the outside in black text, those are a lot harder to find in America now, but in Canada, those products are still going strong. In 2009, during the last big recession, No Name had an upswing in sales. And at the beginning of the pandemic, there were lines down the block outside of No Frills stores in Toronto because when the economy is bad, that’s when more people turn to a store like No Frills.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\nI mean, imagine right now how appealing that pitch is to people who have lost their jobs, have been asked to take salary cuts, as everybody’s self isolates. Even now, that pitch is resonant.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nJim White said to me, his company started with No Name, but it graduated to President’s Choice. And that makes sense. Generic brands and nicer private labels, they’ve always been pitched as opposite. When you think about it, they’re really selling you the same thing. Both of them are saying, “You. You weren’t swayed by brand name marketing. You’re too smart for that.” And really, that’s one of the oldest marketing tricks in the book.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHow the price of bread in Canada, affects the US presidential election, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Well, I’m here with Chris Berube. Hey, Chris!', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nHey, how’s it going, Roman?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m doing pretty well. We’re under blankets or in closets talking to each other.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nWe are. It is.. there’s always a distance between us. But it’s more absurd when I see you under the blanket and you see me in front of all of my shirts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExactly. Exactly. So you have a little addition to this story. So let’s talk about it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nI do. So since I’ve been reporting the story for a while and since I started, No Frills and Loblaws have actually been in the news quite a bit. So I want to do kind of a round-up of all of the Canadian grocery store news that has happened since I started working on this story. And stay with us because, trust me, it gets really exciting. But first things first, Roman, I sent you a clip from the episode, and I think we need to talk about it before we do anything else. So could you play the clip?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGot it. Okay, here we go.', 'Terry O’Reilly:', '\\n“We hired a great designer named Don Watts, who just chose yellow – stark banana yellow – and just big chunky Helvetica type. Yellow feels like a discount color. I guess like its cousin orange.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nRoman, when I was talking to Terry O’Reilly, he’s a very persuasive man, and when he said black and yellow feels like a discount color scheme, at first I was like, “Oh, yeah, he’s totally right.” And then it occurred to me, that is also the color scheme of the show, 99% invisible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s no problem. I sort of think of it that we’re black with yellow. So, you know that we have a slight edge.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThat feels right. I mean, this actually brings me to the first news item about No Frills. Last year, No Frills launched this huge ad campaign. So for a brief time, that bright banana yellow and the black Helvetica font basically took over the city of Toronto. So if you were walking around, you would see it everywhere. So I’ve sent you a couple of photos. I want you to open up the first one.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, this is great. So this is like an old building. It has this sort of mansard roof. Like a single section of the old building is just painted yellow. And it says the word “Building” on it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo for a while, this was everywhere. This was a blanket campaign to get people aware of No Frills. So I’ve sent you another one. Actually, go on open up the second one and describe that too.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is also like a tick off of the No Name label, and it says “No Name” and it’s a big yellow wall. And it says “subway platform with assorted commuters and trains.”', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo this was the strategy of the ad campaign they put out last year, was to basically embrace the irony. They also launched this ironic Twitter campaign. At one point, they live-tweeted the Golden Globes. And one of the tweets from that was an actor has won an award. Like they really have doubled down on kind of the ironic elements of their brand. Right. Right. You know, some people found that really delightful. Like, I don’t know. How do you feel seeing all that?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think it’s great. It’s really like, you know, it taps into nostalgia, which I’m always a little bit nervous about. But I think it brought greater joy into the world. I’m always in favor of greater joy.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nI think that’s right. But there is also some backlash to this ad campaign.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat could possibly make people mad about this ad campaign?', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo the main argument, this is coming from people who are working in food security. So this is largely from advocates who are saying, look, No Frills is a discount brand. It’s not really funny. Right? Like to them, the yellow and black packaging recalls, you know, scarcity. Recalls times when we didn’t have a lot of money. So for them, it kind of really clashed with the ironic embrace of the silliness of the packaging.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI don’t know if there’s an inherent quality of making fun of the fact that there’s discount in these things, so I don’t know.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd I guess the flip side of it is also that if you are taking this kind of ironic, funny tone, maybe it takes away some of the stigma, if there is any stigma of buying at like a discount grocery store. So I think on the whole, like that ad campaign is pretty, pretty good.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, yeah, I agree.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo this kind of brings us to the second news item about Canadian grocery stores. So this one is actually about the parent company of No Frills and pop quiz, you remember the name of the parent company of No Frills?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYes, I do. Loblaws.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIt is Loblaws. So Loblaws has been getting a lot of bad press recently. And part of that is because, of course, COVID-19 has made all of these people who work at grocery stores, frontline workers. And at the beginning of the pandemic, Loblaws and lots of other companies announced that they were giving grocery store workers a raise of two dollars an hour. It was basically hazard pay for people going in to their jobs who had to go ends that we had a food supply that was secure. Well, then in June, Loblaws announced that they had decided to end the hazard pay. What they were saying was that we can’t afford to keep paying people at a higher rate. And a lot of people are mad about that, partly because Loblaws earnings have gone up because more people are going to the grocery store during the pandemic. So that has been this big story. And as a result, there’s actually been some workers who have been striking at supermarkets that are owned by Loblaws.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs well within their rights. It’s absolutely like not any less dangerous than it was when this thing started. And so it makes total sense to me that they would keep getting their hazard pay to keep feeding a nation, which is of critical importance. So I wish them the best of luck.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nWell Roman, this brings us to the third news item about Loblaws. It’s also kind of a negative story about Loblaws, but I think you’ll agree it’s quite a bit funnier. It’s the great Canadian bread price-fixing scandal. So you obviously know that this, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI must admit that I missed most of that.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis is kind of a complicated news item. But follow me here, because there’s a lot of twists and turns and it involves the American presidential election. So Roman, do you know what price-fixing is?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt means basically different competitors are all agreeing on a price. They’re flouting the market and making a higher price for consumers.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIt’s illegal, right? That’s anti-competitive behavior. What happened in 2017 is that the Competition Bureau of Canada announced that for 14 years, Canadian grocery stores had been teaming up to inflate the price of bread. So this was a big scandal. Loblaws admitted that they had a hand in this and they agreed that they had to make good. They were very sorry for what they had done. So they were going to give a 25 dollar gift certificate to anybody who wanted it, who shopped at Loblaws.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd that’s it. For 14 years of making people pay higher prices for bread. You got 25 dollars.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nA lot of people obviously were very mad because they were like, wow, this seems like a huge scandal. So this was a big news story in Canada. A lot of people got their 25 dollar gift cards and it died down. And then this year, the story came back up in the news. And that’s because Pete Buttigieg ran for president.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So please close the loop on this from me because I have no idea what you’re talking about.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nThis isn’t logical for you? So you remember Pete Buttigieg?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course. I remember Buttigieg. I had some affection for Pete Buttigieg. Of course.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nYeah, sure. Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Military veteran. So Mayor Pete, when he was running, there was some criticism of one of his previous jobs, which was that he was a business consultant for McKinsey. So McKinsey is one of these companies that goes in, offers advice on how businesses can run more efficiently. And there’s a lot of pressure on Mayor Pete to divulge what work he had been doing for McKinsey. So he gave out this list of like, here’s all the clients that I consultant on for McKinsey. And one of them was, take a wild guess!', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWas Loblaws?', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nIt was Loblaws.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, well, yeah.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nHere is the actual wording of a press release that Mayor Pete put out. He said he was a consultant with Loblaws on the effects of price cuts on various combinations of items across hundreds of stores.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my goodness.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo when this came out and people started piecing together the timeline, there were all these Canadians saying, “Hey, wait a second. Was Mayor Pete the reason that our bread costs so much money for years?”.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWas he part of that?', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nLoblaws says no. And Mayor Pete’s campaign said we have no idea what you’re talking about. What is this bread price scandal? But it became this controversy and he kept getting asked about it. In fact, when he was doing his big interview with The New York Times editorial board, it was one of the big questions. So I’ve sent you this video link. Have you seen this video?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI have not seen it. So let me watch it.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nSo let’s play it.', 'Binyamin Appelbaum:', '\\n“You have been on the frontlines of corporate downsizing. You’ve been on the frontlines of corporate price-fixing. You’ve been on the frontlines of our misadventures in foreign policy. You’ve had direct experience of many of the things that make a lot of young people very angry about the way that this country is operating right now. You don’t seem to embody that anger.”', 'Pete Buttigieg:', '\\n“So the proposition that I’ve been on the frontlines of corporate price-fixing is (bleep). Just to get that out of the way.”', 'Binyamin Appelbaum:', '\\n“You worked for a company that was fixing bread prices?”', 'Pete Buttigieg:', '\\n“No, I worked for a consulting company that had a client that may have been involved in fixing or what was apparently a scandal. I was not aware of the Canadian bread pricing scandal until last night.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow, that’s quite a moment.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nYeah. So it was published in The New York Times, this whole exchange about the bread price-fixing scandal. And it was probably the most emotion Mayor Pete showed on the campaign trail. And I have no evidence that the great Canadian bread price-fixing scandal torpedoed his candidacy. But, I mean, that didn’t help. That wasn’t a good moment in his campaign.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s amazing that it had such a huge effect. And what a bizarre footnote to this story. Loblaws bread.', 'Chris Berube:', '\\nAnd hey, look, I know a couple months ago when I pitched I want to do this story about Canadian grocery stores, that maybe that wasn’t the intrigue of other things you’ve done on the show but I mean, I think with all of these news items, what you see is that grocery stores are mundane, they’re very “every day,” but they also affect us, you know, like the thing with everyday things is they really have an impact on our lives. There’s so much of people’s lives that are tied to these grocery stores, even though we kind of take them for granted. There’s just so much going on there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Oh, just for the record, I was always sold on this as a story.', 'Chris Berube: I know you are sold. I feel like, though, telling other people I’m doing a story about Canadian grocery stores might not have been the bombshell dynamite pitch.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, I think the fact that the pitch included a clip of Repo Man was enough for me to green light it. I really appreciate it, Chris. Thanks so much.', '\\nChris Berube: Absolutely. Everybody go watch Repo Man.

The post office is there to serve the people who live on the Havasupai Reservation. Havasupai, meaning blue-green water people, named for the waterfall at the bottom of the canyon.', 'Vivian Campbell:', '\\nThe falls are just magnificent. The water is so blue, it’s not even… It’s indescribable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Havasupai receive a lot of food supplies, but otherwise, their mail is pretty standard fare.', 'Vivian Campbell:', '\\nThey get packages from Amazon, they get first-class mail, they get bills just like you and me.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Supai post office was established in 1896 and its existence speaks to the links that the US post office has gone to connect people with each other and to unite us as a country. Ever since the service was founded in the late 1700s.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nI was sitting on my back porch in Wyoming one night, you know, the sun sank in the golden west and I just jumped up out of the chair and then shrieked at my husband. The post office created America.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is author and historian Winifred Gallagher, and she wrote a book based on this revelation called appropriately…', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHow the Post Office Created America: A History.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGallagher argues that the post office didn’t just create an efficient and inexpensive way to send a letter from Oakland, California into the Grand Canyon, the service was designed to unite a bunch of disparate towns and people under one flag. And in doing so, the post office actually created the United States of America.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor thousands of years, governments have had ways of sending information across distances, but for most of history, the mail was limited to correspondence between governments, militaries, and eventually wealthy people who could afford to pay for such a service. And that’s what the postal system of early colonized America was like. The Crown’s Post was put in place by the English monarchy and was mostly used to get messages from England to America.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nOnce the mail landed from England into America, it would be circulated by a fellow called a ‘post rider’ who, just like he sounds, he was a man on a horse. There were no roads suitable for a wheeled vehicle.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt the time, the colonies, which dotted the eastern coast from New Hampshire down to Georgia, weren’t that interested in communicating with each other.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThe colonies were very fractious, disputatious siblings. They had very little to do with each other. They were clamoring for the attention of Mother England.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut all of this started to change when an enterprising fellow named Benjamin Franklin became postmaster for the Crown. As postmaster, Franklin was in charge of making sure mail in the colonies got to its proper location and he was determined to improve the barebone system.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHe actually visited every colony. This is back when it was a real pain in the neck. He established mileposts so you could charge fairly for the distance a letter was going instead of just estimating it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut as Franklin worked to improve the Crown system, he began to see the colonies differently.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nI believe that the process of going around and thinking about these 13 colonies as not just disconnected, but links in a chain. I think this started him thinking about ways that they could come together as a people.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1754, at a meeting of colonial representatives in Albany, New York, Franklin proposed a plan for uniting the colonies.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHe actually kind of sketched out of federal government where the colonies would elect their own representatives as opposed to having them appointed by the Crown.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEngland didn’t appreciate Franklin’s ideas and colonists weren’t quite ready for them either, but 20 years later, notions about American self-governance were spreading. Revolutionaries and the colonies needed a way to communicate about the growing movement for independence, and they knew they couldn’t use the Crown’s post.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nBecause if they use the Crown system, their letters would be intercepted and they’d be arrested.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1774, these American revolutionaries created their own system to communicate called the ‘Constitutional Post’. Before they fought the revolution or had a system of government, before the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Americans had the post. The underground Constitutional Post was crucial in fomenting the revolution which gave America independence from England, but it was still a very limited system.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere were fewer than a hundred post offices in the entire country and the system didn’t serve that many people and it was basically a tool for political elites to communicate with each other. The founders wanted a better post, one that would serve all people in their infant nation and help them stay united under one flag.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThese people who are already spreading over the Appalachians into the wild west of Ohio and Kentucky.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFounding father Benjamin Rush especially believes that the post office would play a crucial role in the new democracy.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHe was obsessed with the idea that the post office should circulate newspapers to every American. You couldn’t have an educated electorate if the people weren’t literate and they didn’t have up-to-date political information.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut this would be no small undertaking. They needed infrastructure of roads and a workforce.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThis government had very little money. It was running on fumes, and yet he says, ‘We’re going to have this very, very ambitious postal system, much more ambitious than anything in Europe’. It’s really kind of astounding.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1792, Congress passed the Post Office Act. Under the act. New postal routes were established, censoring or stealing mail became a punishable offense and all newspapers can be mailed at the same low rate to promote the spread of information. It set off a huge explosion of newspapers from all sorts of political viewpoints. The post office was the main way, sometimes the only way people got information. It was the media', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nWe were news junkies back then. The founders ensured that we would have an uncensored, lively, contentious political culture because they wanted the people to be exposed to all kinds of views and argue it out and then vote.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWe’ve been arguing and gossiping and spreading information – not all of it true – since the very beginning.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nIn a way, you could take the attitude of ‘they sort of created a Frankenstein’, but in fact, it was by design.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAround the same time in the late 1700s, the stagecoach was becoming a more popular way to travel and a better way to carry mail than just packing up a rider on a horse. The post office started to contract with private stagecoach companies to carry mail and these companies worked with cities and towns to build roads.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn this way, the post helped carve out the early transportation infrastructure of the country connecting disparate communities. When a group of people settled in a new place, the residents would petition the government for a post office, which gave them the address and a place on the map.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nAnd then that town would be connected to another town down the road. You started to have this kind of network. It’s developed, not just our physical landscape with roads, but a social landscape so that you could start to talk about this huge country with some locations.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1831, when the French diplomat and writer Alexis de Tocqueville toured America, he was amazed by our postal system.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHe’s riding in a stagecoach through someplace in the Michigan outback and he sees people coming out of these kind of crude huts, you know, cabins, desperate to get the newspapers enabled to talk about not just American politics, but what’s going on in Europe. He’s flabbergasted.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt this point, the mail in the US was mostly about sending and receiving newspapers. People didn’t really send letters because they couldn’t afford to.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThey kept the rates for letters high and they use that revenue from letters to pay for the delivery of newspapers to all Americans everywhere. Most people got fewer than a letter a year. You get a letter saying, ‘Paul has died’ or you’d get Aunt Latisha’s will.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd unlike today where the person sending a letter covers the cost of postage, back then the recipient had to pay. You go to the post office, you’d stand in line and see if you had mail and then pay for it if you wanted it.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nIt created this fantastic backlog of unclaimed mail because so many people didn’t want to pay.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn the 1840s and 50s, the population of the country exploded with new immigrants and all of these new people wanted a less expensive way to communicate. A movement for cheap postage started to form. This movement wanted people to be able to send letters anywhere in the US for one low price using a new tool, the prepaid postage stamp.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThey argued that the volume of the mail would increase to a degree that would make up for the revenue and they were correct. Because the volume of the mail really went gangbusters after a cheap postage.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe postage stamp allowed regular people to send letters. People sent enough letters to fill out dozens of Ken Burns documentaries. It was the Victorian era and letter-writing became an art form. There were even books with advice on how to refine your letter writing style.', 'Excerpt from Letter-Writing Book:', '\\n“Address your correspondent by his or her title, not the first name – dear husband, beloved brother, dearest friend, honored sir. No matter how close you are, don’t address him by his first name. Begin your letter with I take pen in hand. Please pardon the poor paper, the scratchy pen. The ungraceful language.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWomen especially became avid letter writers.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nWomen actually started wearing little lockets around their necks with their stamps inside.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWith more women using the post office, the place itself began to change. Post offices historically had been often in the backs of taverns. They were men’s social spaces.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nYou know, there were prostitutes at the post office plying their wares and, famously, pickpockets.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen women started sending letters, post offices added special ladies’ windows so that ladies could pick up their letters without coming into contact with these unseemly elements. Slowly, post offices transitioned into more professional spaces.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy 1860, there were some 28,000 post offices in the US. People were sending thousands of letters and newly invented greeting cards to each other, but they were also using the post just like the founders intended to disseminate political information. Abolitionists, for example, were using the mail to spread ideas about ending slavery. In the 1860s, when the Civil War was being fought over some of those very ideas, the American post office would bifurcate for a time. No mail would be sent between North and South. And the Civil War brought another big change in America’s postal system: home delivery.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nA postal employee in Ohio named Joseph Briggs found it heartbreaking during the war because people desperate for news of their soldiers away would have to stand in long lines at the post office.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOften, these people would be receiving news of a loved one’s death.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nAnd there were just scenes of terrible, terrible grief and in public. They didn’t even have privacy and he found it so heartbreaking that he ran this pilot program of bringing people the mail.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHome delivery caught on, and by the mid-1860s many cities were offering it. About 30 years later, people living in rural areas would also get home delivery. But while people in the eastern United States entered a letter writing boom, new settlers in California felt isolated. It was hard to receive mail on the west coast.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nSo the mail could go by train to Missouri, but then it had to be hauled by stagecoaches through really terrible conditions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe other option would be to send a letter on a 13,000 mile, six-month trip around the tip of South America by boat.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nCalifornians, as they became more powerful by the gold rush era in the succeeding years, became outraged by the fact that they had this lousy postal service and they demanded to have a reliable stagecoach mail that would depart and arrive on predictable times.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nEventually, they got what they wanted. By 1857, the post office had a fairly reliable route from east to west. It took 25 days, which was better than it had been, but it was still not great.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA group of businessmen led by a guy named William Russell thought they could do better than the US post. Russell thought his little startup company could get the mail from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California in just 10 days.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nHe, in fact, he did it. People didn’t think he’d be able to do it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRussell’s competing service was called the Pony Express. Riders on horseback would race at full speed for about 10 or 15 miles to relay stations where they would trade out for a rested horse. This change was supposed to take only two minutes. Horses were to carry no more than 165 pounds, including the rider. If an exhausted horse collapsed on the trail, the rider was to run on foot to the next location with his bag of mail. It was a very expensive endeavor and it didn’t last long, about a year and a half, which was okay because by 1861 the transcontinental telegraph would reach California, and rail service would soon follow.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTrains would eventually deliver mail all over the US and not just deliver it but become moving post offices. In fact, subsidies from the post office allowed the rail system to expand throughout the country. Trains couldn’t afford to run on passenger fare alone. The money they got from the post office was crucial in helping them expand service. Years earlier, these postal subsidies had done the same thing for stagecoaches and after World War I, the post would do this again for aviation. Planes were not a viable form of transportation until the post office poured money into the industry.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nThe aviation industry wasn’t able to pay for itself with passenger service until well into the 1940s.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe industry survived and expanded by carrying mail for the post office. In fact, before Charles Lindbergh made his historic non-stop flight across the Atlantic, he had another job.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nCharles Lindbergh was a night pilot. He carried the mail.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf the post office truly created America, and I think Winifred Gallagher makes a pretty good case that it did, it’s now playing a more supporting role. In the last 40 years or so, Congress has cut back considerably on services and if you’d noticed longer lines at the post office and delays in receiving your mail, that’s why.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nIn my opinion, no one should be mad at the post office. They should be mad at Congress. Congress has prevented the post office from modernizing and running itself efficiently and tragically going digital, which it should have done back in the 80s.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGallagher believes the post office missed an opportunity to facilitate email and other digital communication, but she argues the US postal service probably isn’t on the brink of death, either. Conservatives talk about privatizing the whole operation, but right now Gallagher doubts that this is possible.', 'Winifred Gallagher:', '\\nActually, the private competitors, neither FedEx or UPS, is equipped to handle the volume of American mail. They would certainly risk bankruptcy if they tried.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe post office has an unparalleled delivery infrastructure and employs an enormous workforce, and we still need the service they provide because unlike FedEx and UPS, the US post office cannot pick and choose where they deliver based on profit. It is obliged by law to provide pickups and deliveries to every community in the country, even if that community is located in the bottom of the Grand Canyon.', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Katie Mingle with Delaney Hall, Sharif Youssef, Avery Trufelman, Emmet FitzGerald, Sam Greenspan, and me, Roman Mars.

And you started digging into this story.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. So, his emails started like this. “A couple of years ago, we took a trip to Hawaii, and my wife became obsessed over a few blue stop signs we saw in the parking lots. The signs were the size and shape and use the same lettering as normal red stop signs, but they were bright blue.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI had never seen this either, either in images or in real life. So, I started looking into why some were blue, and that turned out to be pretty easy to figure out. But it got me wondering something a lot more fundamental, which is, why are the rest of them all red?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhy are they red?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExactly.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWhy is that such a thing in the first place?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And that got me into, of course, digging into the whole history of stop signs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOf course, of course. That’s the only way this is going to go with you.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. It’s just my nature. And as I was looking into this, this one figure kept popping up everywhere I looked, a guy named William Phelps Eno, who in the early 1900s became known as the “Father of Traffic Safety.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHuh. Okay, so what do you have to do to earn that title, the Father of Traffic Safety?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo, Eno was born way back in the 1850s. And if you think about it, 1850s, he’s in New York, this is a New York without cars. So of course, it’s a New York without stop signs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWithout stop signs, totally, yeah. The roads back then were kind of this open space that was shared by carriages and pedestrians, and they moved all around. It was a lot different.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight, right. There was some attempts to do some traffic management and stuff, but it was all kind of ad-hoc and people standing in the street, and it wasn’t very organized. It only got worse, right? As more technologies evolved, and more and more people were on the streets, and cars started showing up. And it just was increasingly clear that this was a mess, and it was going to need some kind of regulation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so, was Eno some kind of road expert? Is that what he was working on?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, that’s the thing. Not really. He came from this family real estate business, decided it wasn’t for him. It wasn’t his passion. His passion was traffic. So, in 1900, he writes this article, and it’s not entirely clear in hindsight if he realized what he was doing at the time. But he basically was writing a treatise that would lay the groundwork for everything he would do for the rest of his life. So, in the end, he would come around to inventing and evolving all different kinds of traffic innovations, things we take for granted today, like rotary junctions and pedestrian crossings.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. So, he really earned that title, the Father of Traffic Safety.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAbsolutely. Once his ideas got some traction in the U.S., he began helping other cities create traffic plans, and some really recognizable designs trace back to him, like roundabouts at Piccadilly Circus in London, and around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. And he was even inducted into the Legion of Honor by the French government after World War I.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor traffic?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s how he got that. Wow.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nHe essentially got France’s equivalent of a knighthood for traffic design. But if you think about it, from their perspective, his traffic designs helped get French troops to the front lines, which in turn, helped them to hold off the Germans during the war. France is pushing like 60,000 troops towards Verdun to hold the German advance towards Paris. It was all made possible by this guy’s traffic planning.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so, was Eno the man who invented the stop sign?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, that’s the thing. I kind of fell down this rabbit hole of looking into him. But one thing I realized along the way was that I was never going to find the inventor of the stop sign.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBecause it’s one of those things that has existed in various forms for a while now. But it’s safe to say that Eno played a really big role in popularizing stop signs and yield signs and that kind of signage infrastructure. And that’s why his name comes up so much when you’re looking into these things.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAlso, put this in context, right? Stop signs back then, they weren’t what we think of as stop signs today. Their designs varied from place to place. One of the first ones that popped up in Detroit in, I think it was 1915, had black lettering on a white background, presumably for contrast. So, they really came in all these different shapes and sizes, and there was no sort of one person you could say, “Aha, that guy made the stop sign.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, I think that makes sense to me that there would be a need for stop signs and therefore, they would be invented in multiple places and multiple times. So, when did they sort of get this octagonal shape that we attribute to them? When did that happen?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. So, that one actually does have a specific answer. And the answer is 1923. That’s when the Mississippi Valley Association of State Highway Departments decided to standardize the shape.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s a very specific answer.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYes. Yeah. And it was a pretty good idea to make it a nonstandard shape – something that would stand out – but there was actually more to it than that. They had this idea that they could create an association between geometry and safety.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExplain more what you mean there.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, they believed that the shape itself could communicate something, like part of what the sign was trying to do could be achieved through the shape of that sign.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So, we’re not talking about just associating a rare shape with a specific meaning. They actually, there’s some kind of theory behind eight having a meaning that ties to stopping.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYes. And this was a huge surprise to me and-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause it sounds like nonsense.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt sounds, right… It sounds sort of occult almost, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nBut I found it, I found this out through this New York Times magazine article by Hilary Greenbaum and Dana Rubinstein. And I’m just going to have you read this excerpt, for context, that explains why the Highway Department Association recommended different shapes for different signs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. Here it is. “The recommendations were based on a simple, albeit not exactly intuitive, idea: the more sides a sign has, the higher the danger level it invokes. By the engineers’ reckoning, the circle, which has an infinite number of sides, screamed danger and was recommended for railroad crossings. The octagon, with its eight sides, was used to denote the second-highest level. The diamond shape was for warning signs. And the rectangle and square shapes were used for informational signs.” That is just wild.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt really is, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, there’s so many questions I have about this. And one of which is, does a circle really have an infinite number of sides?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, yeah. So, I’m thinking back to grade-school geometry. And I’m like, I think that there’s something to that. I think it’s like-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, if you take the tangent of each point and therefore, it has an infinite number of sides, but I don’t think people perceive it as having an infinite number of sides.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nNo. I don’t think-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think they perceive it as having one side.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. It’s not like we look at a circle, a square, and a triangle and we say, “Aha, right. Three, four, and infinite.” It never in a million years occurred to me that there was some grand geometric theory behind U.S. stop sign shapes. But if you think about it, if you start to unpack it and you look at signs around you, you can sort of understand what they’re getting at, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt’s like, well, yeah, rectangular signs often tell you what exit to take or something. There are circles at railroad crossings, sure.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, but there’s also armbars at railroad crossings, because the circle is not quite enough sometimes. There’s also Xs and bars and all kinds of other things. So, I get that there’s a theory behind it. And if it has some kind of basis in semiotics, I’m willing to entertain that notion. So now that in 1923 in Mississippi, they established the shape, how did they come up with the red background?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, that might seem like the simpler decision. That one actually took a while longer. At the time, yellow was often used, in part just for material science reasons. They couldn’t get a really good reflective, durable red, and so yellow showed up well at night. So, for decades, that was the general standard. And then in the 1950s, they made red the official standard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so, yellow because you can make kind of a matte yellow and it contrasts really well with black, for example, and it looks really good at night. But until you get that shiny red that you see on a stop sign, red is not a very good stop sign color.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And if you think about when you see a red stop sign at night, it is really shiny and really reflective. Also, by that time too, we’ve got stoplights and other signage, and red has really got this built-up association of being a thing telling you to stop. So, making them red just kind of fit with the grander scheme of everything else that was going on at the time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, and it’s a warning color in nature. I suppose yellow is too, but yeah, it makes sense. So, how does this get us to those blue stop signs in Hawaii that Daniel found?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOh, right. That’s how we come full circle, or full octagon as it were. And it turns out the blue-painted stop signs are actually exceptional on purpose. You usually find them on private property, places like store parking lots. And the reason they’re blue is so they won’t be confused with other official government red signs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat makes sense. So, they’re intentional fakes because they don’t want it to seem like it’s a sign maintained by the city or county. So they’re like mall cops. They have a badge, they might have a gun, but they’re not actual cops.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, right. Whether you actually decide to pay attention to what the sign is telling you is a little bit up to you, but it is really clear what it’s trying to tell you, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, that’s one of the things I think that’s so great about the stop sign is that, with the shape, the word ‘Stop’, and the color, you can really take one or two of those elements, and at this point, it’ll convey the meaning. Like if you had a red octagon with no word “Stop” on it, I think people would generally stop.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. Or if you saw an octagon from behind, you’ll know that that’s a stop sign.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe other people have to stop, yeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. Yeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Well, that’s a good sign. So, they were onto something in Mississippi in 1923, and they figured something out. That’s so cool. Well, there we go.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And I actually have another blue sign for you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThis one is actually not so much of an exception as the rule.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, a blue sign, but not a stop sign. So, which one are you talking about?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. So, the ones I’m talking about are these big rectangular, super recognizable ones that if you’ve ever driven between cities, you have seen one of these. They’re those big blue signs that tell you which businesses are at which exits.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, yeah. When you’re traveling, these are the greatest signs ever, because this is where you get to check out if there’s an In-N-Out Burger on that exit, or you have to keep going, because there’s nothing good to eat.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nExactly. They’re super easy to recognize. You know what they look like, you know what they’re telling you. And they’re generally called specific service signs, and there are actually three different types of them. One of the ones is the one that you just mentioned, which is the main line sign, and that tells you where to get off for what. Then there are these smaller ramp signs that you see when you drive up the off-ramp. And then there are these smaller trailblazer signs, and all of these are designed to route you to the exact place you’re trying to get.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And so, I’ve always kind of wondered how those signs work. I mean, who gets to be on them? Because not every business at the exit is on one, and they really do serve as your guide to the road. So, how does that all happen?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThey’re pretty standard-looking from state to state, but the details of how they work can vary quite a lot. But the big idea is that businesses have to meet certain criteria to get a spot on these signs. So, for example, they may need to be open a certain number of hours per day, and days per week, and weeks per year. They might have to have a certain minimum capacity for patrons, a certain number of seats and bathrooms, a certain number of parking spots. And these requirements can get really specific like restaurants in Kentucky have to be open and serve water from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh. Okay. Wow. Okay. So, that’s actually really great, so that you’d know that there’s a basic level of service. And so, do you get on the sign if you meet those requirements basically?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, it depends. It depends in part on demand. In some places, businesses have to get at the back of a line basically, and wait to get their spot on the sign. They also have to develop versions of their logos that fit within the dimensions of the box, which are of course standardized on the sign. And then, depending upon the location and the size of the sign and the type of sign, you might actually have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars a year to get a prime placement on one of these.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. So, it really is like a paid advertisement after all.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nIt is, but there’s some more nuance to it too. In Oregon, there are discounts for nonprofit organizations that want space on the sign. And in California, some of the sign revenue gets set aside and put towards creating and maintaining rest areas, which is a really nice public service.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSome of us are just geeks, and we like learning about these things. But for people who are on the road a lot, this is really useful information, right? You know when you look at the sign, if you know the rules for the state, you know what to expect from the stop, that the businesses there will offer certain things and be open at certain times and be within a certain distance to the exit. And all of that’s really handy if you’re somebody who spends a lot of time on the road.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And if you’re really thirsty in Kentucky, you know if you see a restaurant on that sign, you can pull over and get a drink of water.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThat’s right. But only for 14 hours a day.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, we’re going to pull off the freeway and the big blue signs onto kind of a rural route highway for our next ubiquitous icon. This is really kind of not so much an icon as it is an object that became an icon, and it is the mailbox. And it’s the specific kind of mailbox. It’s that metal, flat-bottomed, rounded-top, little red flag on the side. If you’ve lived in the U.S., you’ve definitely seen one of these. You raise or lower the flag if you have outgoing mail. I mean, this thing is truly ubiquitous.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And even if you don’t live in the U.S., you know what they look like because you’ve seen them in graphic format, you’ve seen them in pictures. These things became a digital icon a long time ago. But in terms of the physical box, well, it’s a pretty simple and elegant solution, but it grew out of this really long history of problems that the United States Postal Service was having. And it didn’t actually come out until 1915. But to understand it, we have to go back another half-century or so to 1863. And that’s the year that the USPS introduced free city delivery.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, I think of the U.S. Postal Service as having universal access, so that you get mail delivered no matter where you are. We did a whole episode about that sort of thing.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. Right. But universal access doesn’t mean universal access to mail at your front door. And that was the sort of key innovation that created a little bit of a rift between city dwellers and people who didn’t live in cities.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, so people who lived in cities because they’re close together, they got their mail delivered to their door. But people who lived out in the country did not get that luxury.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. Right. And it makes sense, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThey can go door-to-door much more easily in the city than they can in the country. And so, this was a big boon to people who were living in cities. But if you think about when we are in the 1800s, most people aren’t living in urban areas at this point. They’re all spread out. And so, the standard practice was that they would go to their local post office if they wanted to pick up or send mail.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Which is why you see all these really beautiful little rural post offices around. I subscribe to a Twitter account that just shows you pictures of them. But I really love them.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI love it. No, me too. I love these tiny little post offices of all shapes and sizes. But of course, if you’re thinking about it from a practical standpoint, all of these people living out in the countryside aren’t totally thrilled that they’re paying the same postage rates as people in the city, but aren’t getting the same level of service, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThey’re not getting this door-to-door service like city dwellers are.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I can imagine them getting pretty upset with that. So, how did this tension eventually resolve?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. So, finally in 1896, the USPS starts testing out rural free delivery. That solved some problems and created others. Because suddenly, farmers and other people living outside of cities were just cobbling together mailboxes from whatever was handy, like lard cans and feed crates and cigar boxes. And basically, they just would take anything that was box-like, and pick it up and mail it to a post.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. I love it.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI do, too. Honestly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, I can imagine that being a bit of a pain because you have to figure out if you’re a postal carrier like, is this thing nailed to a post a mailbox or is it something else? Or is it a peach basket for basketball, for example.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight, right. And every one, they might open differently. There’s no standardization here. So, the USPS ends up having to impose standards, and they started requiring boxes be purpose-built for mail, that they be made of metal resistant to snow and rain, have some kind of flag or signal to indicate that there’s outgoing mail inside, and of course, that they be high up enough that they could be reached from vehicles. And on top of all of that, they also had to meet certain size dimensions because of course, mail has to actually fit in these things.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, that pretty much describes the mailbox we’re talking about. So, what if you didn’t comply? What would happen if you just kept your lard can posted up?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, you got a warning, and that warning was that your service will get cut off if you don’t get a compliant box. And then you got instructions as to where you can get a compliant box, and there were a dozen or so models that the USPS had vetted and said, “Okay, these are suitable for mail.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. That sounds like a good start. I mean, if it’s not too onerous or too expensive, at least they have a few options.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, yeah. It was a step in the right direction, but it also caused some other side effects, one of which was a conflict of interest. Because suddenly, people would ask their mail carriers, “Well, which box should I get?” And companies figured out, “Oh, hey, we could pay these mail carriers a commission to suggest our box.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, no.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nSo, suddenly there was this kind of perverse incentive for mail carriers to hawk different boxes, and that wasn’t going to work for the USPS.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. Oh, they’re taking kickbacks. Oh, I’m so disappointed.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay. So, what did they do to solve that problem?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, basically in the end they said, “Okay, no more of this kind of picking out from a list” or whatever. The USPS just turned inward to somebody who was already on staff, a guy named Roy. And they said, “Roy, make a box.” And he made a box. Not just any box, he made one that was basically open-source, a design that any company could legally take and make. And so, this took the competitive aspect out of the equation. So, there were still different companies building the boxes, but there wasn’t any real incentive for somebody to recommend one option over the others, because they all had the same design.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so cool. And so forward-thinking of the time to make it open-source. So, how did Roy come up with this perfect mailbox design that’s become the icon of today?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nWell, in a lot of ways, he built on what was already there, these guidelines that the USPS had set out. But he also focused on making them simple and cheap so that anybody could afford one. So, his box has this arched top to prevent snow and water from accumulating. And the curve shape also made mass production easier, because it turns out, wrapping a curve is easier than precisely bending metal. Then there’s that classic front latch, which helps protect the mail inside. So, in the end, he took all of these criteria and he made this thing that was functional and durable and inexpensive and used as few moving parts as possible.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike he just followed the brief and was a great designer, it sounds like.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah, yeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s fantastic. So, I tend to see these more out in the country. And I’m sure I’ve seen them in cities too, and especially in suburbs. So, they really weren’t just for rural delivery. They really became the mailbox.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And that’s in part because of this open-source aspect. Because the design had no patent, any company could just make them. And because they worked well, a lot of companies did just that. It also didn’t hurt that the USPS mandated that people use these boxes in rural areas for a while. It wasn’t until the late ’70s actually, that they started to relax the restrictions and let people use a variety of box types.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Because I definitely have seen other ones. It’s just, I just see this one a lot. And that’s really outstanding. That’s explains why. Well, I mean, I guess one of the reasons why it’s been so re-inforced is that this design has definitely gone digital. I mean, you see a profile of that type of box, the rounded top, the little red flag, you know what that means. That means mail.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nOh, yeah. Yeah, there’s even an emoji called “Closed Mailbox with Red Flag”. And it is absolutely, super obviously based on that classic design that was made over a century ago.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so great. So, do we know Roy’s last name?', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI believe it’s Joroleman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI’m not sure I’m pronouncing that entirely right, so we might want to check that before we air it. But yeah, I believe it is-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOr we could just go for it. Kurt, let’s just live a little.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nI just like the idea of Roy the mail guy sitting there designing his box.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOur hero for today is Roy, who worked at the USPS and made that mailbox that we all know and love.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nLet’s all raise a little mail flag to that guy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen we come back, another thing that you’ve definitely seen along the highways and freeways, those little dots that light the way. After this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’re back with another story, and this one we actually included in the book, “The 99% Invisible City,” so actually you know it ahead of time. It concerns those reflective markers that you see along the side of roads or between lanes. There’s lots of different kinds. There’s lots of different places around the world that they exist. But the most interesting character we discovered who worked on a very early version of these was a British inventor named Percy Shaw. And with a lot of great origin stories the details of Percy’s breakthrough, they kind of vary depending on who’s telling the story. But they all have this one thing in common, it started with him driving along a narrow road on a foggy night in the early 1900s near his hometown of Halifax.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAs his brother told the story, Percy was coming home from one of his usual haunts, a local pub, but as he drove around this sharp corner he saw the reflective eyes of a cat alongside the road, and because he saw that cat he avoided driving his car off of a cliff and crashing. And probably dying.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNormally, Percy didn’t rely on, you know, good fortune and cats crossing his path to stay on the road. He relied on tram lines in the road, they were the metal reflection from the tracks of the trams. He would use those to orient himself on the road, but they had been ripped up and so he was stuck kind of squinting through the fog and that’s when it came to him, that he would invent a way to solve this problem for himself and other drivers and not rely on cats.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd it was very much in his nature. Percy had always been a fixer and a tinker from a young age. He actually left school at the age of 13 to help his family make money, and he ended up starting a paving business, and then finally in 1934, he patented this device that would reshape the roads of England and then eventually go global.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, his design involved a pair of reflective glass beads embedded in a cast-iron frame. These retroreflective cat’s eyes, they redirected the light back towards the cars with minimal scattering, so you really could see them. They stood out in the dark night. And they were really sophisticated, like the metal part protected the glass, but it also lowered when cars drove over them, both for safety reasons and to create a noise. They alerted the drivers with the noise. And probably my favorite detail though is that these little rubber wipers were added later, so basically when the housing got pushed down the glass would wipe up against the wipers, so the device was self-cleaning.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAll of this is really sophisticated, so it may be obvious, but Shaw didn’t invent these overnight, right? He tried out all these different designs and he iterated on them, and one of my favorite parts of the story is how he approached this design development process. So instead of getting approval and having authorities sign off on him testing them out, he just went out and started adding his various prototypes to local roads.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe good old days. I mean he did own a paving company, so-', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n… he just started ripping up the roads, and he would try out different designs, good old Percy Shaw.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. He was perfectly suited to doing this, just not quite legally allowed. But even then he had another problem too, which is that once he got this design together he couldn’t seem to find buyers until the Second World War came along. Suddenly there were wartime blackouts because of air raids, so nights are darker than ever. Drivers have been instructed to add dimmers to their headlamps and do other things to reduce their visibility on the road, so accidents are happening, and the government responds at first by painting white lines on the roads and on posts to help people see at night. And then suddenly Percy, who’s been asking to get an audience with the government to see if they’re interested, has these cat’s eyes that are just perfect, right? They use illumination from cars to light up, so they don’t have an independent source of light that would attract attention from the skies, and the next thing you know the government is buying like 40,000 of these things a week.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd to some extent, this is where the design spread internationally. The other places, they also came up with their own different solutions to fit their regional needs – like here in California, which is a huge state and there are lots of climate ranges, there’s like hot and sunny places, there’s cold and snowy places – you need to use different markers in different places in different times. And some reflectors are recessed into mountain roads, for example, so they don’t get scraped up by plows. There’s lots of things you have to work on, and so these things have been iterated and have different origins depending on where you are in the world.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And if you think about Percy’s cat’s eyes too, that was one of the things that made them work so well in Britain. Britain is foggy and rainy, so these wipers were particularly useful, so in a way, they were sort of… You know, they could be universal, but they also were very site-specific as a solution. But no matter where you go, there is this type that’s more common than any other. It’s basically just a trapezoid, right? It’s got a ramp up on one side, a sort of flat top, and then a ramp down on the other side.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, so you can see it in the two different directions, depending on which way you’re going down the road. And it’s not just the trapezoid shape that’s used in a lot of different places. A lot of the colors are pretty common too, so here in the US, for example, it’s really common to have white reflectors to divide lanes and yellow reflectors on the edge of the road, but also there’s some variations there too. So you can have greens and blues. They indicate things better on the side of the road, so pull-off spots for cops can have a different color, and like locations for fire hydrants to signal firefighters are also a different color.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nRight. And I love the fact that you don’t typically notice the color differences. Like you see the reflectors, but some of them are like cued in to tell different groups about what they can find. Then there’s this other neat function that they can serve too. Because of their trapezoidal shape they can have different colors facing different directions. For example, a reflector can have white on one side and that tells you you’re going the right way, and then it can have red on the other side, which lets you know that you’re going the wrong way.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou’re pretty much going the wrong way.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nYeah. And you should probably just stop your car, maybe turn around slowly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf there’s one lesson from this show it’s that if you see red maybe stop, or consider stopping.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nMaybe stop. Blue also sometimes, but not always. Yeah. Yeah.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo in the book, we go over all these different details and we talk about different designs that we find in different places, but we really tell the story through Percy Shaw.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nAnd in the end, Percy became something of a local legend in Halifax. There’s this plaque affixed to his old house and his design won a bunch of design awards, but he never really seemed to care about all that stuff. He did travel for work, but he preferred to mostly stay close to home. One of the few ways that you can actually tell he had become this kind of rich and influential guy was this Rolls-Royce Phantom, and people would tell stories about him riding around in it, driven by his chauffeur, and often just traveling to and from his favorite pub along those very same roads that inspired him to create this thing that made him famous in the first place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo there you have it. This is one story of over a hundred that we have in the book, and in “The 99% Invisible City” we have illustrations of all these things too, including Percy’s cat’s eyes and a variation called Botts’ dots, which are really common in California, and those trapezoidal reflectors that we talked about as well.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is definitely the kind of story you can expect from the upcoming book in general. We talk about specific designs and places and characters and all the ideas and lessons and histories that are specific to a place, but also have global implications and global meaning.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nExactly. And while you’re waiting for your copy of said book, I’ve also been writing a bunch of articles about how the book was made and have been answering a lot of questions people have. I’ve been gathering some process materials from our illustrator, Patrick Vale, and our designer, Raphael Geroni. I’ve been assembling these into some neat surprises and sort of behind-the-scenes pieces about how we made the book, because of course we’re a design show, so we’re not only interested in talking about design in the book, but we’re also interested in talking about the design of the book.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd some of the process, the iterations that Raphael went through when he was working on the cover, for example, are super fascinating. I even forgot some of the different versions that he did. And the pictures of the drawings, they’re so cool. You should definitely check them out. They’re all at 99pi.org, and if you want to order the book directly you just have to go to 99pi.org/book. All right. Thanks, Kurt.', 'Kurt Kohlstedt:', '\\nThank you so much, Roman.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSandy Allen is a reporter and a writer. They live in upstate New York and they often go into New York City to run errands and go to meetings. And when they’re out and about, finding an accessible bathroom can be a challenge.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\n“All right. So I’m on a university campus in New York City and there is a women’s room and a men’s room and then a guy saw me sort of waiting to, you know, figure out what I was going to do.”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThis is a recording. I made a few months back when I was in New York City.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s Sandy.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThis was before COVID and I kept an audio diary of my bathroom search. He said to me, “It’s multiple,” referring to the men’s room that he just exited. I think because he thought I was waiting to enter it. So… hooray, bathrooms.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor context, Sandy is nonbinary and transgender.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nIn terms of looking “male” or “female”, I land somewhere in between. Some strangers call me “sir”, others call me “ma’am” and so public restrooms always present this dilemma. In women’s rooms, people look at me weird or say mean things, but I’m often too afraid to go into men’s rooms. I’m short and I have this voice and I worry that those traits could make me a target. It can feel risky and exhausting to navigate these two bad options.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\n“Okay. I’m in the New York City subway and I didn’t find the bathroom earlier and it’s been hours and that is pretty difficult. So I’m going to just hold it for more hours. Hooray.”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThis particular day in New York, I went the whole day without finding a bathroom I could use.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\n“And I’ve been… oh, out and about all day. I haven’t used the bathroom at all because I couldn’t find one. I couldn’t find one where I had a meeting earlier and I couldn’t find one at my dentist’s office.”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nFor many trans and non-binary and intersex people, this is the norm. Really for anyone who doesn’t conform to gender stereotypes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSome folks choose to risk the stress and sometimes physical danger that can come with entering bathrooms that are segregated by sex. Others choose not to.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nInstead, we hold it.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\n“Women’s rooms and men’s rooms, but there was no gender-neutral option at all. Okay. Bye.”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nIt’s hard to overstate the effect this has had on my ability to exist in the world. I’ve stopped going to the gym. I hate to travel because my local airport doesn’t have any bathrooms that work for me. Every trip out to a restaurant, a theater, or really anywhere is laced with this underlying feeling of anxiety.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd over many decades, this kind of bathroom-related anxiety has been a reality for lots of different kinds of people, not just trans people, because ever since their invention, public bathrooms have been these sites of conflict about who’s included in public life and who’s excluded.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBefore widespread indoor plumbing, public restrooms didn’t really exist. Instead, people used the privy, which was basically just a hole in the ground, sometimes with a little outhouse style building.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy and large, privies were not segregated by sex, nor were they segregated by class.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nThe outdoor privy was used by rich and poor alike across the United States.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThat’s Terry Kogan, a professor of law at the University of Utah. He is basically the expert about the history of sex-segregated bathrooms in the U.S. And he says that it wasn’t until the mid-1800s that indoor restrooms started to become a thing.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nBeginning in the late 1840s and 1850s, cities began developing municipal works. Waterworks and sewage systems that actually could accommodate indoor water closets. So once that came about, the outdoor privy was replaced by indoor water closets.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAt first, it was only the very wealthy who could afford this latest in plumbing technology. Having a bathroom inside your house was a luxury.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut gradually indoor water closets became more widespread. And as they moved into the public realm, they entered a world that was at the time shaped by this very popular idea, which was called the separate spheres ideology.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nAnd that ideology basically said that women should remain in the home and men’s appropriate realm is in public, in politics, working in factories, whatever. And this vision was very, very powerful.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAllowing women into the public sphere was thought to be risky because given their weakness, they could become contaminated by the vile influence of men.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, I’m also worried about being contaminated by the vile influence of men.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nYeah, I get it. But what you have to understand is back then the idea would have been about literal contamination. It was then considered consensus among scientists who were basically all men, that women were weak and vulnerable and susceptible to disease.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut women of course were not weak, nor were they actually confined to the home. By the early 19th century, more women than ever were working and getting involved in politics.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nSo, one is faced in the first part of the 19th century with this tension that the cultural etiology said women should be in the home. And the reality was that women were leaving their home in ever-increasing numbers.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd American building designers had to find a way to navigate this tension. They had to figure out how to create public spaces that both accommodated women, but still kept up this ruse of women being relegated to the home. The solution they came up with was to segregate public space. They designed ladies-only train cars and ladies-only dining rooms and waiting rooms.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd these spaces were often decorated to look very domestic with the sort of sofas and wallpaper and drapery you’d see in an upper middle-class living room.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nAnd the thinking was that for those ladies who dare to venture into this dangerous public world, these are protective spaces for them.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd so these living roomy looking women’s spaces became a fixture of public life across America. And that meant that when toilets eventually moved inside to places like theaters and restaurants, they were also segregated by sex.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGradually as the 19th century went on, society started to desegregate the sexes but even as men and women started mixing more, segregated bathrooms stuck around. They’re a vestige of this ideology that once insisted that men and women couldn’t share a public space at all.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd one of the reasons that segregated bathrooms have proved so enduring is that these separate facilities were actually codified into law. The first laws were passed in the 1880s and they had to do with women factory workers and how they needed a space where they could rest when their weak female bodies gave out-', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nWith its vision of women as vulnerable beings who needed protection.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut the history of public bathrooms isn’t just about who is seen as worthy of protection. It’s also about who’s seen as unworthy.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nThere have been many waves of panic and resistance to new people moving into the public sphere and needing accommodation and a focus of that panic has often been public bathrooms.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nSo yeah, I mean, pretty much every decade, there’s been some controversy about public toilets.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThis is Professor Susan Stryker. She’s written among many works, a groundbreaking book called “Transgender History.” She says that for as long as we’ve had public restrooms, we’ve had battles about who belongs in them and who doesn’t.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd she thinks that we fight about bathrooms partly because they’re these very charged spaces.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nWe have all these taboos around waste and elimination and privacy and smell. It’s very difficult for people to think rationally about some of these things. We just react at an emotional level.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd Professor Stryker says, pick a moment in 20th century American history and chances are there was some sort of freak out about some group of marginalized people using the bathroom.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nWith the rise of more visible gay and lesbian communities in the years after World War II, they were panics about gay male sex in public toilets. There was a sense of gay men being predatory to straight men.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBy the 1950s and 60s, activists began challenging codes of racist segregation in the South. This included challenges not just to racially segregated water fountains, lunch counters, and buses, but to racially segregated bathrooms.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nIf you think back to any signs that you might have seen from the bad old days of Jim Crow, it was not uncommon to see public toilets labeled “Men”, “Women”, “Colored”. With the rise of the feminist movement you saw in the 60s and 70s, particularly around efforts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment that you had right-wing people who were opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment saying, “Oh, they’re going to require unisex bathrooms.”', '[ALREADY WE GO TO THE SAME BATHROOMS ON AIRPLANES AND BUSES. DOES THIS MEAN THAT WITH THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT, IF IT IS PASSED THAT THERE WILL NO LONGER BE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE DOORS, BUT US OR WE OR WHATEVER?]', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nBy the 80s, you had the AIDS crisis.', '[IT’S A DISEASE FIRST DETECTED IN THE GAY COMMUNITY THAT HAS NOW SPREAD BEYOND THAT.]', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nAnd there was another wave of panic around public toilets: “You’re going to get AIDS there.”', 'George Bush :', '\\n“The ADA ensures access to public accommodation such as restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and offices.”', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is passed in 1990 and again, there’s a wave of, “Oh, it’s going to be too expensive. Why do we have to accommodate those people?”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nWhich brings us to the bathroom-related panic of today, which is about people like me and like Professor Stryker-', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nA moral panic around trans people.', '[TODAY THE LEGAL BATTLE OVER WHICH BATHROOMS TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS CAN USE IN NORTH CAROLINA. IT’S BECOMING MORE HEATED BY THE DAY.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis debate about trans bathroom access became a big national story a little over five years ago. You had ordinances – or proposed ordinances – in states like North Carolina and Texas which attempted to restrict which bathrooms trans people could or couldn’t use.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nTerry Kogan thinks this surge in anti-trans bathroom activism has something to do with the Supreme Court allowing for gay marriage in 2015. After that happened, all the conservative money and energy that had gone into that fight had to find a new target.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nThis conservative energy coalesced around trans people and their desire to use the restroom that accords not with their birth sex, but with their gender identity.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPeople on both sides of this debate claim that they’re on the of safety. One side says, “Hey, trans people deserve bathrooms where they can feel safe.” The other side says, “Women shouldn’t be attacked in the bathroom by cross-dressing men.”', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut as Professor Stryker describes, this notion of a predatory cross-dressing man is a fiction.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nThat fear is completely fantasmatic. It’s like, “Show me the police reports of cross-dressed, male sex predators in public toilets.” It’s like, “I don’t think you can find one.” It’s a fear. It’s not a fact.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nIn reality, if you look at the numbers, it is trans people who are at greatest risk of being attacked in public restrooms. According to Professor Kogan, if you look at surveys of trans people-', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nThe number is roughly 70% have experienced either verbal or physical abuse. And among some populations, in particular black trans women, the level of abuse is much higher.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nI sometimes find my friends who aren’t queer really don’t seem to understand just how dangerous public restrooms can be for me. How every time I want to pee or wash my hands, I do a calculus about my likelihood of being endangered by some random person. I don’t know a trans person who doesn’t have a story or many about being harassed by a stranger. Like I was talking with Seb Choe who’s an architect in South Carolina and they told me this story about going to a swimming pool with their partner.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nAfter getting exercise, we went to go use the sauna because saunas are great.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut Seb faced a problem, which was there was a locker room for women and a locker room for men.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nI was already kind of apprehensive because I’m trans non-binary.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSo Seb and their partner picked the women’s room because that was for them, the better of the two available options.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nI knew that I could probably come up against some friction, but I felt a responsibility to use the sauna where I felt like I belonged more. We were in the sauna for a little bit and this middle-aged white woman enters and asked me to leave because she wants to use the sauna. I calmly told her that she was welcome to join and use the sauna with us. Then she kind of left in a huff and brought back this male staff member who asked me to leave.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nEveryone watched as Seb was escorted out of the locker room. It was humiliating. It was isolating. It was also, for a trans person, an entirely ordinary experience. This kind of thing happens to us all the time.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nAnd it’s generally a pretty horrible feeling of exclusion, just trying to use the sauna.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nIt’s the most mundane stuff that we have to think twice about. Whether to swim. Whether to use a changing room. Even for somebody like Professor Stryker who’s lived out of the closet for decades.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nI transitioned surgically and socially back in the 90s. I still look over my shoulder when I go in to the women’s room. Every single time, it’s like, “Is somebody going to notice something? Are they going to freak out? Is this going to be a scene?” A lot of us who are trans kind of call it the tax. It’s part of the tax. You get taxed just for walking around being trans in the world. And part of the trans tax is always being mindful of moving into those sex-segregated spaces.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even though we take it for granted that most public restrooms are segregated by sex, they don’t have to be this way. And as the debates around trans bathroom access began heating up, one architect began thinking about exactly that.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nMy name is Joel Sanders. I’m an architect with a practice based in New York called JSA.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nJoel had long been interested in bathrooms. As a gay man during the height of the AIDS epidemic, he remembered how public restrooms had become a flashpoint back then. And he was especially interested in the lack of attention his fellow architects seem to pay to these spaces.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nI think for society, the bathroom is the ultimate sort of functionalist architecture. It doesn’t require design. It doesn’t require creativity.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut the reality is, is that bathroom design does matter whether architects realize it or not. When they design public bathrooms, they’re deciding who’s included and who’s excluded when it comes to fully participating in public life.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nJoel figured if they put their minds to it, architects could reimagine bathrooms entirely.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nAnd so I picked up the phone and I reached out to a colleague of mine who I’d met many, many years before named Susan Stryker.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat a coincidence! Susan Stryker was just here, let me go get her.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nYou know, we just started talking. We would have long rambling phone calls with each other about it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd in these calls, Susan and Joel started identifying all the ways that bathrooms… suck, to use an architectural term. Not just for trans people, but for pretty much everyone.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nI think that public toilets don’t work well for most people.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nThey could be people who are breastfeeding.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nPeople who might need to do medical care of some kind, like maybe they need to take their insulin.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nPeople with urinary tract infections.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nYou know, the dad who’s got the daughter and he doesn’t want her to go into the bathroom by herself.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nMuslims who perform bathroom ablutions.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere’s also the problem of unequal bathroom lines.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nYou go to the theater and at intermission, there are huge lines of women waiting and smaller, if no lines in the men’s room.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe buildery term for this is overload.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThen there are the problems many people with physical disabilities have with public restrooms. Joel Sanders was introduced by a mutual friend to Quemuel Arroyo. He uses a wheelchair and used to advise the New York City Department of Transportation about accessibility. He met up with Joel for dinner.', 'Quemuel Arroyo:', '\\nIt was an instant love fest. I mean, we spoke for hours.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nQuemuel detailed all these horrible experiences he’d had with public bathrooms. Like when he was at an airport and had to search everywhere for a stall that was big enough to fit his chair inside, and in the end, he couldn’t.', 'Quemuel Arroyo:', '\\nI ended up having to use a stall and leave the door open behind me because I literally couldn’t shut the door behind me.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd then there are the horrors of public restroom sink design.', 'Quemuel Arroyo:', '\\nI spoke about how pissed off I’d get when I’d use a sink and because it was a flat top surface, the water would drip down onto my pants.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nQuemuel sees all this bad design as a failure of imagination.', 'Quemuel Arroyo:', '\\nSo many of these “accessible bathrooms” still don’t get it and they don’t get it because they’re being designed by people who don’t understand accessibility.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd so Joel Sanders kept imagining what an actually inclusive public bathroom might be like. He kept talking to Susan Stryker on the phone and the two began meeting up and then collaborated on an academic paper. And then-', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nTo make a long story short, we received so much interest in the design community and really in the general public that we founded “Stalled!”.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s “Stalled!” with an exclamation point, as in the bathroom stall, but also how this whole bathroom debate is totally stalled out. The Stalled! project would tackle not merely the problem of trans bathroom access, but totally reconceive of the bathroom so that it works way better for way more kinds of people.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut Susan and Joel quickly hit a big snare. The code. Right now for public buildings over a certain size, the building code mandates that you must build what are termed separate facilities, meaning a women’s room and a men’s room.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nWe could come up with design solutions, but unless they’re legally implementable through building codes and laws and public policies, they’re not going to happen.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSo, they called up the country’s foremost thinker on laws about bathrooms.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nThey needed someone who, in a sense, could deal with the legal issues.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nTerry Kogan was thrilled when he got this call. He told me Joel and Susan were actually two of his intellectual heroes and so he jumped at the chance to join the project. And then Joel happened to meet Seb.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nI was introduced to Joel after the lecture by a friend who knew him.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSeb was graduating from the architecture program at Columbia and Seb joined the project too, as did Quemuel.', 'Quemuel Arroyo:', '\\nI believe that people want to be invited to participate.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese people are coming together like the Avengers of inclusive bathroom design.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nIt’s the Avengers, but more queer and about bathrooms.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so the Stalled! team at last assembled got to work fighting their arch-nemesis, sex-segregated bathrooms.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nTerry and his colleagues began spearheading a legal appeal to change code and the architects got to work totally re-envisioning designs for certain public bathrooms, like ones for elementary schools and ones for airports.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nWhy airports? Because it seems to be a place where there’s a high quantity of diverse bodies spending a lot of time and also having to address their embodied needs.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn totally reimagining the airport bathroom, the first thing the Stalled! team did was get rid of the idea that the bathroom is a room with a door. Instead, the airport bathroom is now conceptually an extension of the public space, like a big lounge. This space is then divided into three activity zones.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSo activity zone number one is grooming. And they’re proposing a counter.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nBut not just a counter at the height of a standard able-bodied adult, but one that undulates at different levels.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWith mirrors also of varying heights.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nAnd it would allow people of different heights and abilities to groom together. A public space.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nActivity zone number two is hand-washing. Doing away with that traditional countertop that Quemuel Arroyo and other wheelchair users hate so much.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nInstead of individual sinks, Stalled! proposes a water wall with a splash plane that’s angled slightly away from the user.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nIt would not be at one standard height but would be at multiple heights, again to accommodate children, elderly, different body heights and weights.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThe water itself would be recycled to water plants, which would help bring a sense of calm to the space.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich brings us to activity zone number three.', 'Joel Sanders:', '\\nA kind of continuous wall of differently sized stalls. And again, it’s key that they need to be of different sizes. Some would be standard. Others would be larger for people with mobility issues, people in wheelchairs.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd the stalls would ideally be totally floor to ceiling to provide maximum privacy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Stalled! bathrooms include other details that would make them more welcoming for all kinds of people, like foot washing stations for Muslim people and floor materials that make the space easier for people with vision impairments to navigate.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAll of this is more inclusive and it’s also safer. Because instead of being divided into two or sometimes three groups (men, women, and disabled) in this re-imagined bathroom all people can monitor a single common space.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nOne quickly sees that these are open spaces which provide, in a sense, double the eyes on the street.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSo these bathroom Avengers had defeated one foe, the idea that public bathrooms could only ever be sex-segregated. But that left one more front in this war – the legal one. The battle between Terry Kogan and the body that governs the building code.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nVirtually every state and municipality in America and in many foreign countries is governed by a model code called the International Building Code.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe International Building Code or IBC is governed by a group of builders, architects, city planners, and other design experts who together make decisions that hopefully keep the public safe. Rules about stuff like light switches and handrails. This group gets together every three years to agree to changes to the code-', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nTo account for technological innovations and building innovations, whatever.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nTerry and the other lawyers involved with the effort appealed to change the line of code requiring separate facilities. Terry told me there are some very practical buildery arguments that you can make in favor of inclusive design. You don’t necessarily need to appeal to people’s sense of equality.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nAn all-gender, multi-user restroom is a much more efficient use of space than sex-separated restrooms.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThey prepared their arguments for the committee in the lead up to the big meeting about amending the code in the fall of 2018. Then came a long wait until the decision finally became public this spring. And-', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nAnd then in the next iteration of the code, the multi-user type that we champion will be code compliant.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nMeaning in the very dry language of code compliance, they won! So starting soon, architects and builders will have greater freedom to choose this kind of bathroom. They won’t be required to build sex-segregated bathrooms anymore.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis development is a major step towards having more inclusive bathrooms in the world but with some caveats. Like first off, it’ll take some time for that new code to actually be adopted by local governments.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd governing bodies at the city and state levels could also purposefully choose to ignore this particular update.', 'Terry Kogan:', '\\nNow, they don’t have to adopt it, hook, line and sinker, so they conceivably could choose to leave out this exception.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSo there is a chance that this single line of the building code could become a flashpoint. A new front in the culture wars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI guess my hope is that people will look at these redesigns and realize this just makes so much more sense for everybody. Like, Sandy, I want this bathroom.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nTotally. It makes me think of something that Susan Stryker said.', 'Susan Stryker:', '\\nWhat I feel is so elegant about the Stalled! public toilet project is that at some level, it just doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what most people think about trans people. It doesn’t matter if you feel like you should accommodate people with disabilities. It’s like, by the design of the space, it just solves the problem.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd like, of course, I’d love if all people recognize that I am a full person, deserving of rights and respect. My dream is to be walking down some airport terminal and to stumble upon a multi-user inclusive restroom like the Stalled! one. I picture entering it. Seeing that mirror of varying heights, that undulating countertop, the water wall, the plants. I envision entering one of those single-user stalls and locking it behind me. But, you know, for now, I’ll just take a bathroom I can use.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\n“All right, I’m at Grand Central Station. Very beautiful. There are no bathrooms for me. I also wanted to buy a sandwich to eat on the train and realized I won’t be able to wash my hands first. So I bought some Purell, and I’m going to pretend that’s like washing my hands. Okay. That’s it.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up after the break Sandy and I will discuss bathroom signage and the extremely simple, but often overlooked way that they could be designed for greater inclusivity.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’m back with writer Sandy Allen. Hi, Sandy.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nHi, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo there’s another element to this whole idea of inclusive bathrooms, and it has to do with bathroom signs.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nRight. So if you picture a bathroom sign right now, what do you picture?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s two figures. There’s a pants-wearing figure. There is a dress-wearing figure. And that’s the man symbol and the woman symbol.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nBut in like a really outdated stereotype. It’s like a picture of the concept of the binary gender.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, that and, you know, even the most retrograde human alive today doesn’t associate women with just wearing dresses. Like even if you were just to buy into the gender binary, wearing dresses is not just like this hallmark of womanhood anyway.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nYeah. So it’s like gender in a 1950s sense.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. But it’s something, you know, I’ve seen so often. And I think that maybe my sensitivity to it is is sort of diminished because I kind of take it for granted that it is what it is.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nRight. And that’s because it’s pretty much everywhere, right? Like, there are some variations. But across the US, in my experience, at least pretty much everywhere. It’s some play on men’s/ women’s, ladies and gents, you know, cowgirls and cowboys.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it raises questions like if we’re moving towards more inclusive public restrooms, so why not more inclusive public restroom signs. Like what would they look like?', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nExactly. And this is actually something that the Stalled! team has thought about. How do we make a sign that’s genuinely inclusive? And so they started out by analyzing the signs that are already out there. And one interesting thing they found is that bathroom signage really varies by geography. Here’s Seb Choe again.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nLike in many European countries, the restroom signage just says WC for water closet and that’s sufficient. We’ve been doing research on restrooms in South Africa and in other countries where the sanitation system is not at the Western standard. And a lot of those times signage is sometimes not even present. So I think it’s important to remember that when we’re talking about gender binary signage, it’s definitely culturally and geographically relative.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, and this is something I’ve definitely noticed because where I live in the Bay Area, you do see some signs that don’t rely on the gender binary, for sure.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nYeah, that’s true. In some parts of the country, those liberal West Coast cities especially, you’ll see, you know, places turning single-user stalls into what are sometimes labeled all-gender restrooms. Or sometimes you’ll see a sign that includes a male figure and a female one in a wheelchair, maybe accompanied by a phrase like gender-neutral.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nI would say our team doesn’t think that’s the ideal sign either because we’re not really gender-neutral. We don’t want to neutralize gender because they are such rich expressions of that identity. And also, of course, that just reinforces the gender binary by having that male and female figure and also others. It segregates the wheelchair user, which is kind of this nonhuman character almost. It’s not male. It’s not female. It’s this other category, almost like colored bathrooms where “colored” was its own category.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAnd so as they did their research, what started to become clear to the Stalled! team was that wherever designers tend to rely on avatars, human figures, it seems like the icon will always fail to capture the complexity of humanity by implicitly leaving some folks out.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nIn general, Stalled! does not advocate for using those gendered human avatars in bathroom signage at all. And instead, we advocate for inclusive restroom signage to use fixtures of what is included in the restroom, which can be as simple as a toilet icon.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nThat’s the huge revelation. Make the icon a toilet!', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, it’s really obvious. At the end of the day, if there’s one piece of equipment that you expect to see in a public restroom that you really need, it is a toilet. So why not just depict a symbol of that?', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nYeah. And perhaps you’d want that sign to include other fixtures as well, depending on the situation.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nYou can include other things like a baby changing station or a sink icon. And I think this also makes the restroom more inclusive, not only by just saying clearly what is inside this room you’re about to enter, but also to not prioritize certain languages over others.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nSomething that Seb points out is like, this doesn’t have to be some top-down exercise where architects dictate to society what signs should be like.', 'Seb Choe:', '\\nI see plenty of trans-inclusive signage on the Internet of like unicorns or aliens and saying, “whatever, just wash your hands.” There are clever ways to denote that, you know, “whoever” is included. I honestly celebrate that. And I don’t want to flatten the creativity of graphic design by having this kind of, you know, singular universal sign of a toilet that everyone has to use. You know, I think it’s fine for smaller establishments to get creative with it as long as it’s inclusive of everyone, but I think just as a best practice, a fixture is better than, you know, a woman in a dress.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, totally. I mean, anything’s gonna be better than a woman in a dress. I do kind of wonder that some of the really creative iconography could be a little flippant for something that’s pretty serious. Like if you have like, you know, the man symbol, the woman symbol, and an alien symbol, you know what I’m saying.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nAbsolutely. And that’s something we talked about and I think it’s all about, exactly, are you being inclusive and if you’re making a man-woman-alien-unicorn, ultimately, it’s offensive, right? So I think it has a lot to do with, like, taste and how people are choosing to, I think, really take that advice of opting to depict what’s inside this room rather than what sorts of bodies are allowed to use it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. But does seem like this is a really good moment to think about it as we’re sort of like entering public life anew, kind of, from this period of time of being kind of closed up in our own homes. It can be a moment to have that kind of exploration right now.', 'Sandy Allen:', '\\nYeah. Something I’ve been thinking about is this is actually maybe a moment for small business owners, for example, to think about how to make their bathrooms more inclusive.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd if you’re one of those listeners who has actually seen an interesting gender-inclusive bathroom sign, take a picture of it and tweeted at us @99piorg and we’re going to be collecting some unique samples and, you know, how people approach this design challenge.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nJanuary of 2020, marked the New York Public Library’s 125th anniversary. And to celebrate, they published a list, the 10 most checked out books in the history of the library.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd there’s one thing about the list that you really can’t help but notice right away.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s our producer, Joe Rosenberg.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt’s made up almost entirely of children’s books.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nSo, The Snowy Day, The Cat in the Hat, Where the Wild Things Are, Charlotte’s Web.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nDan Kois is a writer at Slate.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, arguably a children’s book, also on the list.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, I mean like, I read it as a kid. I’m not sure. Anyway…', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nFine, but come on, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, The Very Hungry Caterpillar?', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nThe only books “for adults” on this list are 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. Loved that that book is still on there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAll told, seven of the 10 books were for kids. Taken together, they were checked out over two and a half million times.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut the very bottom of the list, Dan Kois noticed this little footnote.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nAnd it just said, fun fact, Goodnight Moon, of course, one of the most beloved children’s books of all time was not on the list.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe footnote was almost like an apology because if there’s one title that you’d expect to be on the list, it’s Goodnight Moon. The famous picture book where the little toddler rabbit says goodnight to all the objects and its massive bedroom, goodnight socks, good night clocks, goodnight, you know, moon.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nI was really surprised, not only because I know of its popularity, but because I have always sort of viewed it as a kind of platonically perfect children’s picture book, for the exact moment in the day when you most need a picture book.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat moment when you need your child to fall asleep. So you can finally take a shower or watch TV or do anything, except parent.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nStill, the book had only been checked out about half as many times as the lowest ranking book on the list, but it wasn’t because of lack of interest. No, it was because of one person.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nAccording to the New York Public Library, an influential children’s librarian at the library had disliked the story so much when it was published in 1947, that the library didn’t even carry the book until 1972. And this librarian’s name, according to the press release was Anne Carroll Moore.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnne Carroll Moore was the head children’s librarian at the New York Public Library, for pretty much the whole first half of the 20th century. And for nearly three decades, she single-handedly kept Goodnight Moon out of the entire library system', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nThat a children’s librarian could just say, “No New York public library will stock this book.” And the idea of children everywhere in the world growing to love Goodnight Moon, except for in New York City, where they grew up sad and goodnight moonless, just seemed bananas to me.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nNow, at this point, if you’re imagining your stereotypical rule mongering moralizing librarian giving you the stink-eye, Dan Kois says, “You don’t need to imagine it. There are pictures.”', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nAt the time that there were finally photographs of her taken, she was an older lady who looked like the quintessential bun in the hair, shushing librarian, who’s a really easy villain.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut as Dan would find out, Moore was and remains a very complicated historical figure.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBecause long before she became a villainous banner of books, Anne Carroll Moore was a hero of children’s literature, who left the world with one undeniably good thing.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nShe pretty much single-handedly invented the children’s library.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nJill Lepore is a professor of history at Harvard and a staff writer for the New Yorker who wrote about Moore for the magazine. And she says that perhaps no single person has ever done more to get books into the hands of children.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd she did so by creating a place for kids to read.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nSo when you go into your neighborhood public library and there is a thing called the children’s room, and they have potted plants there and they have toys and they have a cozy rug and a rocking chair and they have story hours and they have fun art on the walls, like all that stuff was invented by Anne Carroll Moore.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nToday, with all the emphasis we place on instilling kids with love of reading, it’s hard to imagine your local public library without a children’s reading room, but Lepore says that before Moore came along, children weren’t even allowed to enter the one place they would be sure to find a book.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nKids really couldn’t go to libraries. Libraries were for grown-ups.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe late 19th century saw some of the first public libraries being built in America. This was an age in which there was a surge in support for government-funded progressive institutions intended for the betterment of all, or in the case of libraries, the betterment of everyone except children.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nYou had to be, I think, 14 or 16 in most places, and in most places, you had to be a boy. And the Brooklyn Public Schools had a policy that children below the third grade do not read well enough to profit from the use of library books.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe thinking went that if you were too young to read, obviously there would be no need for you to go to the library. What good would that do to you?', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nAnd if you were old enough to read but you were still a child, going into a library, which was full of trashy romance novels and westerns, would just corrupt your mind. And so, certainly, there’s no reason for you to go into a library either.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nJill Lepore says that for the children of the wealthy and middle classes, who often had their own small book collections at home, being banned from libraries wasn’t really a problem, but it left the children of the poor with virtually no access to literature.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nIt’s completely bound up with class discrimination, right? Because it’s really until the 1920s that you have a very strict regulation against child labor. So, if children of the poor are working, like they’re not reading, they’re not even learning to read.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut then at the turn of the century, Anne Carroll Moore, the crusty old librarian who hated Goodnight Moon, came along and flipped the purpose of the library on its head.', 'Jan Pinborough:', '\\nSo I was very surprised recently to read in an article, someone described her as the quintessential librarian with the bun in her hair and shushing the children. When in actual fact, that was exactly what she did not do.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nJan Pinborough is an editor and children’s book author. And she says that in the 1890s, Moore was the most vocal and energetic among a small group of young progressive librarians, who’d begun experimenting with a radical idea. What if they finally let kids into a library, stocked an area with children’s books, and then made that area just for kids.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nAnd what she was trying to do, and this is what’s really important, she was trying to provide a childhood to working-class kids. She was trying to give them all the luxury and leisure of having a space with books that are made for them to be able to read so that they would have, what we would think of now as a way to address an achievement gap. And she was trying to level that field.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd in 1906, Moore got the chance to run this experiment on an unrivaled scale.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe New York Public Library was building its iconic main branch at the corner of 42nd Street and 5th Avenue. And it would feature a dedicated children’s reading room, that would be designed, stocked, and run by Moore.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nAnd, there are just these incredible photographs of that children’s room, when it opened in 1911.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe photos depict one of the earliest public spaces designed exclusively for kids. Moore started by borrowing the idea of kid-sized tables and chairs from kindergartens, but she took the concept even further.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nShe had benches, window seats built at the bottoms of the windows, giant windows, but they’re like pint-size. Like if you were five years old, you could sit in those window seats and your feet would touch the floor.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMoore especially wanted to provide poorer kids from the tenements access to the beauty of the natural world. So she installed pink floor tiles to catch the light, coming through the windows and then filled the room with shell collections, butterflies, and dozens of bowls of freshly cut flowers.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nAnd these children, a lot of them were starved for nature, and they would line up for the chance to look at and smell the flowers when she brought them in.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMoore took down the “Silence” signs, the library was now a space for puppet shows and musical performances and story hours. Featuring stories in multiple languages, so that the children of immigrants, who did not yet read or speak English, would still feel welcome.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut most importantly, Moore filled the shelves of the new reading room with hundreds and eventually thousands of children’s books. Not locked in a cabinet or in a rich kid’s nursery, but out in the open, for any child to pick up, leaf through, and read.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd if a child liked the expensive book they were holding, they could take it home. The only requirement was that they sign their name in a big black ledger, alongside a pledge.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\n“When I write my name in this book, I promise to take good care of the books I use in the library and at home, and to obey the rules of the library.” And it was a kind of sanctified moment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe pledge turned the process of checking out a book into a child’s first act of citizenship.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe room was an overnight success, rich and poor kids alike flocked to libraries and Moore began training librarians to establish new reading rooms throughout New York, including Nella Larsen, the prominent African-American writer who created the first children’s room in Harlem.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy 1913, just two years after the children’s room opened, Moore could boast that one-third of the volumes borrowed from the city’s branch libraries were children’s books.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd children’s rooms were springing up even more quickly in the rest of the country. By the end of the 1920s, by one estimate, there were perhaps as many as 1500 children’s rooms in the US alone.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nAnd her reach was really worldwide. And there are places and countries where people would say, “Well, if you walk into that library, you’ll realize that that was touched by Anne Carroll Moore.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe spread of Moore’s reading room model was also instrumental in establishing children’s literature as literature. Moore convinced the library going public that books like the Velveteen Rabbit, Winnie-the-Pooh, and the works of Beatrix Potter, were in fact art. And the 1920s saw an explosion in dedicated children’s departments at major publishers. And of prizes like the Newbery medal, which Moore helped create.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nSo, for multiple generations of New York children, Anne Carroll Moore was the reason that the libraries became places that fostered their love of storytelling and love of books.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut all this came with a crucial caveat, which is that Anne Carroll Moore’s vision was never limited to simply creating a place for kids to read. From the beginning, it was also about what counted as children’s literature.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, even as she was letting more children than ever into the library, Moore was keeping all kinds of books out.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nAnd as the head of the children’s department in the New York Public Library, she was in charge of choosing the books that the children’s departments of all those libraries acquired.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd the NYPL’s purchases often set the standard for libraries nationwide.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBack then children’s titles were only published once a year in the fall. So every year around the same time, Moore would make a list of her favorite upcoming books.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd that list was used by other librarians across the country.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nSo if you ran a library in Dubuque, Iowa, and you were trying to figure out, “Well, what am I going to spend my budget on?” You just go right down the list, you go, “I’m going to buy one of this, two of this, three of this, one of this. Oh, none of this.” Whatever. You would use that list to guide your purchasing.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMoore also had a regular review column that parents and librarians alike used to decide which books were worth buying and which weren’t.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nSo, she’s the most eminent children’s book reviewer in the country. But then, because she was also the chief purchaser for books, she quickly accumulates really far too much power.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAt the height of her career, in the 1920s and 30s, she was like the Anna Wintour of kid’s lit. Editors and authors were routinely seen walking up the steps of the public library’s main branch, between the two marble lions, to drop off their books and await Moore’s verdict. If they were lucky, she’d send back notes for suggested changes, which they would dutifully incorporate into the final draft. Others weren’t so fortunate.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nThe story about Anne Carroll Moore, although no one including her biographers, knows whether this was apocryphal or not, was that she actually had a custom made rubber stamp that read, “Not recommended for purchase by expert.” And that if she didn’t like your book, she would stamp that on your book. And you… that’s it, your book’s dead. No one’s going to order your book, better luck next time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd there were a lot of manuscripts “not recommended for purchase by expert,” because Anne Carroll Moore had very specific tastes in children’s literature.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nShe may have been a great advocate of children’s books as art, but in her zeal to protect kids from the horrors of poverty and urban life, Moore almost invariably favored magical, once upon a time stories that felt pastoral and tweedy. The whole point, was for them to take the less fortunate into their warm bougie embrace.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nSo her favorite children’s books, the ones that she approved, certainly weren’t meant to represent anything that a child might actually see or experience in his or her everyday life. They were meant to be little mini escapes into this magical world of talking animals and rabbits and waistcoats and whatnot.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nTo be honest, this is kind of where most of my experts for this story get off the Anne Carroll Moore train.', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nLike she was a sharp-eyed critic. It’s just, it’s not my eye, so I’m trying to be charitable here. Say like, she likes gooey and she likes super sweet and she likes silly animals that talk.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBecause Winnie-the-Pooh is great, right? But for a few decades of children’s literature, from the 19 teens through the 1920s, pretty much everything coming out of the publishers was very “Pooh.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMeanwhile, there were almost no books for kids that took place in cities, no books for kids that depicted real-world problems, and very few children’s books containing messy ideas or ambiguous endings, stories with those qualities never made it passed Moore.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAlthough sometimes, a book can meet all of Moore’s criteria, and she would still have it killed for reasons known only to her.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\n“Do you think Moore… you said she’s a pretty sharp-eyed critic. Do you think she had a kind of systematized notion of her own gatekeeping rules or was she just like shooting from the hip?”', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\n“You know, I have no idea. I think she was drunk with power. Like I think she loved being the lady in charge. Like I think she just loved having the entire publishing industry at her beck and call. And she thinks she’s right, and she has no doubts about it. Like she thinks she’s right.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even as Anne Carroll Moore held the publishing world in her iron grip, a small group of preschool teachers were busy writing stories for kids that embodied everything in children’s literature that Moore hated.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nTheir stories would go on to influence an entire generation of children’s book authors. And they worked just a few blocks away at an experimental school in Greenwich Village, called Bank Street.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nBank Street came along and said that picture books ought to be stories about modern urban life.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nLeonard Marcus is a historian of children’s literature. And he says that the Bank Street cooperative school for student teachers, founded by the great educational reformer, Lucy Sprague Mitchell, was in many ways the ancestor of today’s progressive schools. They believe that teachers should let children guide their own learning experience.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd it just so happened that when people trained as teachers at Bank Street, they didn’t read textbooks, they were trying to write stories for children. So, the future teachers would really know from their own experience, what kinds of stories are meaningful to kids at different ages.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd when the teachers tried to write stories for the youngest kids at Bank Street, they noticed something important.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nChildren are interested in the world they find themselves in.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nCertainly, there are children who have flights of fancy and think about dragons and wizards and whatnot. But anyone who’s had a four-year-old knows that often the thing that is most interesting to them is the garbage truck that comes by every Tuesday afternoon.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo instead of a book about magical realms, a book published by Bank Street would be about the child’s more immediate world. Focusing on the kinds of things that small children in cities really, really like, like streetcars and a trip to the grocery store and steam shovels.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDesigned for the very young, these stories rarely had plots. They were more like games – circular, interactive, and open-ended.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nPlot wasn’t the most important thing at Bank Street, much more important was being invited to participate.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBank Street stories might depict a jackhammer or a train going by and then ask the child to imitate those sounds, but also any other sounds they might feel like imitating.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nGiving the child and opening to expand them infinitely, if they wanted to, not just sit there and listen to the once upon a time story.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAll of which pretty much stood in diametric opposition to the philosophy of Anne Carroll Moore.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nThe idea that the everyday life of a child, with no magic whatsoever involved in it, is something that ought to be immortalized in a children’s book, definitely was not … that was not Anne Carroll Moore’s speed.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nTo Moore, these plotless games for the very young, with their emphasis on experience over imagination, simply didn’t count as literature. She made sure they weren’t included in her annual list of best books. She didn’t even deign to write her usual scathing review. And the very first Bank Street books, called the Here and Now series, stayed off the library shelves.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut Bank Street’s earliest stories had another more fundamental problem.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nI think the stories in the first Here and Now book, they’re boring.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMac Barnett is the author of over 40 children’s books. And he says that from the point of view of craft, which is to say of actually capturing a kid’s attention, Bank Street’s first attempts at children’s literature were terrible.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nAlthough they were new at the time and feel sort of radical, they are being written according to a formula. You can see the philosophy, they’re theory-driven.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWriting most of these early stories, came across as stiff and formulaic. There were only occasional illustrations, with no real interplay between image and words. And every story started with an introduction describing this pedagogical intent. Here’s one from a chapter called The Skyscraper.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nThe story tries to assemble into a related form, many facts well-known to seven-year-olds and to present the whole as a modern industrial process. So like right there, like as soon as your story begins with a mission statement, it’s already over, the thing is lying on the floor.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe writers at Bank Street were just as blinded by their own dogma as Anne Carroll Moore. And with the same end result, their stories could never achieve their high-minded aspirations because they felt stale and doctrinaire.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut in the 1930s, one person managed to make the Bank Street style come alive. The future author of Goodnight Moon.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMargaret Wise Brown was a teacher at Bank Street, who didn’t want to be a teacher.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nShe wanted to be a famous literary writer. She wanted her short stories to be published in the New Yorker, but that wasn’t going to happen.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd honestly, neither was the teaching thing.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nAll of her evaluations say like, “I don’t think she’s going to be a great teacher.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo she couldn’t write for adults and she couldn’t teach kids. But when Margaret Wise Brown tried to write Bank Street stories for kids, something weird happened. They were good.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn Brown’s hands, these stories for the very young, with their circular rhythms and game-like structures, were transformed into something new.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nThe big Bank Street realization, I think, from Margaret Wise Brown, is that through talking to kids, she discovered her purpose as a writer, because she found that kids are the best audience for poetry.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nMargaret Wise Brown’s books were more than stories or games, they were poems for children, who were still open to novel ways of seeing and describing the world around them.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nConsider a story from a series of books Brown first started in collaboration with Bank Street, the Noisy Books. The story is about a little dog who hears a tiny, almost imperceptible noise and tries to identify it. Brown asked the reader to guess what the sound might be, but instead of suggesting things that we might think of as making sounds, she points to things that don’t.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nSo it says, “Was it butter melting? Was it a little blue flower growing? Was it a skyscraper scraping the sky?”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe early Bank Street books would have simply asked the reader to register that a skyscraper was tall, but Brown was encouraging them to perceive it in an entirely new poetic fashion.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\n“Skyscrapers scraping the sky,” and suddenly you can hear it.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBrown was also a master of writing poetry that worked in tandem with the art in a book, particularly by deploying page turns.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYour average contemporary children’s picture book will contain 14 page turns and most authors will use these moments to build suspense. If you want to know what happens, you’ve got to turn the page.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut Margaret Wise Brown’s page turns just as often zigzagged, setting up patterns and then breaking them.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nSo you get, “Was it an ant crawling? Was it a bee wondering?” Page turn. “Was it an elephant tiptoeing down the stairs?” And you move across that page turn, from this very intimate domestic scene of a dog, very small on the page, listening at the stairs to this giant two-page spread, this elephant and the scale is gigantic. He barely fits in the frame.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPage-turns like these can be disorienting, and that’s the point.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nYou feel like you’re constantly crashing into new worlds and discovering new things, which again, like that’s what being a kid feels like a lot of the time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBrown also helped change the look and feel of children’s books. As an editor at Scott Publishing, a small imprint associated with Bank Street, she developed one of the first tactile books, featuring lambs with real toy bells and bunnies with real cotton ball tails. Turning the book into a physically interactive object.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut perhaps Margaret Wise Brown’s greatest accomplishment was bridging the divide between the two factions of children’s literature. Her stories provided interactive experiences, focusing on everyday things. But they also contained elements like talking animals and they weren’t afraid to lean into nostalgia and whimsy. So instead of rejecting the documentary realism of Bank Street or the magical escapism of Anne Carroll Moore, Brown found a way to combine them.', 'And nowhere did she do this better than in Goodnight Moon.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nFor Goodnight Moon, Brown took inspiration from something in her own daily life. Whenever she woke up feeling sad and struggled to get out of bed, she’d performed a kind of ritual.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nShe would lie in bed and look around and focus on different objects in the room that she was glad to have in her presence, and would essentially count her blessings.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nShe would take in the books on her shelf, the pattern of her sheets, the view from our window. And then, when she was finished, she would write it all down in a list, get up and face the day.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor Goodnight Moon, Brown simply reversed the ritual, it’s a list you read to fall asleep.', '[MOM: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO READ TODAY?]', '\\n[DAUGHTER: GOODNIGHT MOON.]', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe beginning of Goodnight Moon really is nothing more than a list. Documenting the objects in the bedroom, of a little bunny getting ready to go to sleep.', '[MOM: IN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM, THERE WAS A TELEPHONE AND A RED BALLOON AND A PICTURE OF….”]', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThere’s no plot, no tension, just things.', '[MOM: THE COW JUMPING OVER THE MOON.]', '\\n[DAUGHTER: (LAUGHS)]', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nBut then you move into the second section, unannounced.', '[MOM: GOODNIGHT BEARS, GOODNIGHT CHAIRS.]', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd yet, everyone knows what to do when they get there.', '[DAUGHTER: GOODNIGHT KITTENS.]', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nWhich is chime in.', '[DAUGHTER: AND GOODNIGHT MITTENS.]', '\\n[MOM: RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE NEXT TO IT?]', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd then, you come to the page that says, “Goodnight nobody.”', '[DAUGHTER: NOBODY.]', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nWell, what do you do with that? And it’s up to the child to decide, and that’s pure Bank Street, and I would say pure magic.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd Anne Carroll Moore hated it.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nOh yeah, she hated it. Yeah, she was totally opposed to it.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBy the time Goodnight Moon came out in 1947, Moore was technically retired from her job at the library. But even in retirement, she remained in control of the children’s department, showing up at meetings uninvited, and making sure her policies remained in place.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nEven when her successor would try to change the meeting room at the last minute, Anne Carroll Moore would still just magically show up and run that meeting.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nLeonard Marcus says we know what Moore thought of Goodnight Moon because the New York Public Library maintained internal reviews of every book that was submitted to them.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd I was secretly shown the report on Goodnight Moon, secretly because nobody outside of the library staff was ever supposed to see them. But I found someone who was willing to leak the report to me.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThe report described Goodnight Moon as an unbearably sentimental piece of work.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nWhich is just funny, when I think of unbearable sentimentality as like the jacket copy of a book, you would write for Anne Carroll Moore.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut it didn’t matter, Goodnight Moon had the stink of Bank Street on it. The book was “not recommended for purchase by expert.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nGoodnight Moon, sold only a handful of copies, before more or less disappearing from stores. Margaret Wise Brown died only a few years later in 1952, following complications from a surgery. She was just 42 years old.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut even if she didn’t know it, it was right around this time that Goodnight Moon’s fortunes began to change.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt was the era of the baby boom, pop psychology was in and parents eager to raise their children using the latest methods devoured books and articles about what children needed at various stages of life.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd in 1951, there was a column saying that, “If you have a two-year-old and he or she is not going to sleep, read them this book, Goodnight Moon. It’ll work.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd sure enough, 1951 is when sales of the Goodnight Moon at bookstores slowly began to rise.', 'Mac Barnett:', '\\nAnd that book was read by kids in the late fifties, who grew into adults, who remembered reading that book more than any other book. So bought it for their own kids, who then grew into adults, who loved that book more than any other. And that’s how it happened. It happened in a way that maybe is most terrifying to Anne Carroll Moore. Anne Carroll Moore is sort of irrelevant to the success of that book.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn 1972, the New York Public Library caved and finally put Goodnight Moon on the shelves. At that point, it was selling nearly 100,000 copies a year. As of 2017, it had sold nearly 48 million.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nLeonard Marcus says that Clement Heard, the illustrator of Goodnight Moon, showed him a fan letter once. It was from a mother whose little boy had wanted the book read to him every night, six times, from start to finish.', 'Leonard Marcus:', '\\nAnd one night after the sixth reading, she laid the book down on his bed and he stood up. It was open to a page with one of the full-color illustrations of the room, and he put his foot down on the page and then he burst into tears. His mother didn’t know what to make of it, so she just waited to see what would happen next. And then, he put his second foot down and just completely melted down. And then she realized, what was happening. And she wrote to him and said, “My son was trying to climb inside your room. That’s how real it is to him.”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nJill Lepore says she also came across a letter, but this one was about Anne Carroll Moore. Moore died in 1961, and upon hearing of her death, a prominent editor wrote to a friend, “Much as she did for children’s books, I can’t help feeling her influence was baleful on the whole. Am I wrong?”', 'Jill Lepore:', '\\nIt’s an incredibly powerful, I mean, final epitaph on her life. It seems totally fair to me. She did an extraordinary amount for children’s literature and for children early on, and then I think she kind of lost her grip.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nLepore, however, is also quick to defend Moore. And so is Dan Kois. Walk into the children’s reading room of any library in the country at storytime, he says, and you’re witnessing her contribution.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nThe notion that the library’s mission remains to serve children and to make them feel at home in the space, and to make them feel like reading is a thing for them, is remarkable. And I don’t want to lose sight of that, and for all her faults and flaws, that’s because of her.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIf you go back and look at the list of the New York public libraries, top 10 checked out books, a lot of the titles are ones Moore probably would have banned, had she still been around. After all, Where the Wild Things Are, The Snowy Day, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, they all owe something to the work of Margaret Wise Brown and the teachers at Bank Street.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut the fact that the top 10 list is mostly children’s books in the first place, that’s something we owe to Anne Carroll Moore.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNext up, the story of a doll that delighted children and possibly terrified adults at the New York Public Library. After this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so I’m here with Joe Rosenberg. So one of the reasons why we invented this little coda section is there’s often little outtakes from the story that we couldn’t quite fit in. And I hear you have some really good bonus material for me.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And I wanted to save it for the coda because it is the one subplot in this whole saga that is maybe the thing I most wanted to talk about. But if we talked about it in the main piece, it would just derail the story. Like it would just bring the entire story to a crashing halt.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI know exactly what you mean. I’ve totally been there.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, yeah. And it’s because whenever this comes up, everyone is just like, “Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. What?” And it is the story of Nicholas Knickerbocker.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI already love it. So who is Nicholas Knickerbocker and how does it fit into the story?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo Nicholas Knickerbocker was this creation of Anne Carroll Moore that perhaps represents everything that is most wonderful and most problematic about her, all at once. Because Nicholas was this little wooden, articulated doll that Moore liked to use to talk to kids. It was about eight inches high and when she was in the reading room, if a young child was acting shy, perhaps because their English wasn’t very good yet and she wanted to bring them out of their shell, she would pull this doll out of her handbag and basically say, “I want to introduce you to Nicholas.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so sweet. I actually kind of like that sort of Mr. Rogers kind of quality to it. So did Nicholas have a certain personality or was he just kind of Anne Carroll Moore?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. So Nicholas apparently was a little Dutch boy with a little Dutch boy outfit, which I kind of suspect was a nod to the idea that so many of the children using the reading room were immigrants. But more importantly, she would tell the children that Nicholas came alive at night and had access to this kind of magical world hiding just behind this one. And so the idea was that you might think you were in a normal, old, boring room, but when Nicholas showed up, he would help reveal the magic all around you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. I mean, that actually reminds me of all the types of books that she was really fond of. I mean, she always liked those escapist stories.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight. Very once upon a time, none of that boring Bank Street stuff.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight, right. No garbage trucks, no city problems. Yeah.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, where you just get the child to delight in the mere room itself. No. So the whole point of Nicholas was to propel the child into these flights of imagination that would take them beyond the here and now into these magical nighttime realms.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, that all seems pretty wonderful, that it seems like a good librarian thing to do. You mentioned that it represented kind of the problematic way in which she operated. How did it manage to do that?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. So the problem is that as with so many things related to Anne Carroll Moore, there is a dark side to Nicholas Knickerbocker. And in this case, it’s that Nicholas’s life was not restricted to the confines of the reading room. Dan Kois was telling me that apparently after a while, people started noticing that Moore was carrying Nicholas around with her, like almost all the time.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nI can only speculate as to what people thought about Anne Carroll Moore carrying around Nicholas Knickerbocker. There are photos of her just out in the park, in Bryant Park I assume, just carrying Nicholas the doll under her arm. And I don’t know if it was her way of connecting to children or if she just had some kind of weird-ass fixation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, I mean, I can see his concern or maybe other people’s concern, but a generous reading of this is, she had a cool companion. She had a doll, she talked to kids. It seems okay to me so far.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOkay, fair enough. But keep in mind that walking around the park with the doll was just the tip of the iceberg because apparently, she would also host these dinner parties. And when everyone sat down for dinner, Nicholas would be seated at the table, with his own spot and his own place setting and everything.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd at a dinner party where you’re supposed to talk to Nicholas, is that part of the deal?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, I think so. And even Jan Pinborough, who of everyone I talked to for this story is probably the most ardent defender of Anne Carroll Moore, admitted that this could be a challenge for Moore’s friends and colleagues.', 'Jan Pinborough:', '\\nIt’s been said that some people didn’t like Nicholas because she did, I think, sometimes hide behind him. If she didn’t want to give someone bad news, she might say, “Oh, Nicholas doesn’t like that.” You know? So I can imagine how that would grate on a person.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMe too.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. So I mean, you can see where this is going, right? Because when Nicholas disapproved of something, whether it was at a party or a work meeting, you were still expected to respond and apologize or whatever, because this is Anne Carroll Moore. Remember, she’s this titan of children’s books and your career was in her hands. So you would just kind of be stuck talking to this doll.', 'Dan Kois:', '\\nMy hunch is that everyone talked about Nicholas Knickerbocker when Anne Carroll Moore wasn’t around. And when Anne Carroll Moore was around, everyone was like, “Oh hey, hi Nicholas, how are you?” She wielded just a remarkable amount of power inside the library. And so what would you do if you were in that situation and the person you depended on carried around a wooden doll? You would be like, “Hey, Nicholas, good to see ya. Have a seat at the table. Can I get you a cup of tea?”', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd by some point, according to Jill Lepore, the whole conceit was taken so far that Nicholas actually had his own letterhead and Moore would write letters to children’s book authors and editors in the voice of the doll.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd they would be signed “Nicholas” with a return address on the back of the envelope flap that said “Nicholas Knickerbocker,” and then the address of the central branch of the New York Public Library.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo he lives at the library.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight, he lives at the… Remember, he comes to life at night at the library.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSure. Why not? That’s when he writes his letters. Yeah. That’s when he gets his best work done.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nExactly. That is when he’s at home.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo did the children’s book editors and authors, did they write back to Nicholas? Was that part of the deal of this fantasy?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYou know, I don’t know. I do know that very frequently authors would send him their warm regards by way of Anne Carroll Moore. Like, “Please tell Nicholas I say hello.” Because it was just understood that Moore and Nicholas were like a package deal.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, that makes sense.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut despite the creep factor, keep in mind that kids also wrote to Nicholas. Right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, yeah.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd some of the correspondence and gifts Nicholas received from adults also suggests that a lot of people saw Nicholas as this benign or even kind of benevolent presence. So for example, the author of Billy Goats Gruff made Anne Carroll Moore a miniature version of her first book for Nicholas to carry around. Beatrix Potter sent her these little hand-drawn postcards depicting Peter Rabbit and Nicholas together, almost as if they were friends. And according to Jan, one of the employees from the library was this Russian emigre, and she apparently gave Nicholas a Faberge egg.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWoah. Like a real Faberge with gemstones in it type of Faberge egg?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. Well, she said there was a gem inside. So can I go with at least a… Yes, a Faberge egg with one gem. But the point is, is that in the end, you can make an argument that Nicholas Knickerbocker’s reign, in the balance, did more good than harm. And as was so much of what Anne Carroll Moore did, it’s a close call.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, I mean, creating a character to make kids comfortable in the library is a totally nice and joyful thing to do. Making her employees, adult employees, talk to it is a little odd. But I hope it was good on balance. I mean, I hope for everyone’s sake, it was good on balance. So Nicholas Knickerbocker as an extension of Anne Carroll Moore’s personality, did she just take it with her when she retired or did it sort of live on in the library as this mascot?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nExcellent question. Because this is where this whole weird side story kind of climaxes, which is when the elaborately rendered fiction of Nicholas collides with the reality.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nHe’s just a doll. And dolls can be lost.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh no.', 'Jan Pinborough:', '\\nIt was actually an employee of the library who was riding with Anne Carroll Moore in a taxi cab. And she was in charge of minding Nicholas and left it in the cab.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, I mean, I don’t mean to disparage anyone’s character, but I’m suspecting foul play here. I mean, if I was the adult employee of Anne Carroll Moore and I was in charge of the doll who I had to talk to and serve cookies to, I might be inclined to leave it in a cab too.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. We’ll never know. I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they’re innocent, but I am sure many of Moore’s colleagues secretly cheered when this happened. But then a little while later, apparently Moore just went out and found a new little wooden Dutch boy and basically said, “Oh, good news everyone. Nicholas is back.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my goodness. Oh, the reign of Nicholas, it keeps going.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And so much like Anne Carroll Moore herself, Nicholas Knickerbocker refused to retire.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s so good. Oh, that’s so fascinating. I can totally see why that didn’t belong in this story because I would be totally preoccupied with it. Today, Nicholas Knickerbocker and many of the other figures in this story are getting to live a strange afterlife, thanks in part to this week’s experts. Go to your local library and browse the children’s section and you’ll come across dueling picture books whose authors’ names, if you’ve been paying attention, will look familiar. “Miss Moore Thought Otherwise: How Anne Carroll Moore Created Libraries for Children” is written by Jan Pinborough, and “The Important Thing About Margaret Wise Brown” is by Mac Barnett. Two books have two very different takes on what Anne Carroll Moore was really up to in her reading room. Whether she would have recommended either of them for purchase by expert, we will never know, but a good library and a good bookstore should carry them both.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThanks to all of our experts in today’s story. If you’re looking for an adult book on Brown, check out Leonard Marcus’s “Margaret Wise Brown: Awakened by the Moon.” Thanks also to Seth Lerer, whose voice we did not get to include in this story, but whose book, “Children’s Literature from Aesop to Harry Potter” is a great guide to the deeper history of kids’ lit. We also recommend Dan Kois’s podcast. It’s all about parenting, it’s called “Mom and Dad are Fighting.” You will learn a thing or two about kids’ books in there too. And finally, be sure to listen to Jill Lepore’s new podcast, it’s called “The Last Archive.” It traces the history of evidence, proof, and knowledge. It is fascinating. It is funny. It is really weird in a great way. I just really enjoy it.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHumans have been living in cities for a really long time, but like a lot of things about the past, getting around cities used to be just needlessly difficult because we didn’t have reliable maps, or street signs, or even addresses. An address is something we all take for granted today, but in ancient Rome, if you wanted to go to a friend’s house, you had to use all kinds of context clues. Like you had to remember that the house was two blocks away from a big column, but if you reach the horse stables, you’d gone too far. And you had to rely on nonvisual cues, like smells and noises.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYou had all sorts of noise and street hawkers, and you had different smells. You had the smell of, you know, a meat market.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYes, sometimes you have to use meat smells to figure out where you were going.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nMaybe one of the ways you navigate is you navigate much more by your senses. You can actually use what you’re seeing, and what you’re smelling, and what you’re hearing as a ways of navigating around the city.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is Deirdre Mask.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nI’m the author of “The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal About Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDeirdre’s book looks at how the world has changed since street addresses became popular during the Enlightenment. So today we’re going to take a tour through some of the many ways street addresses shape our lives, including how we fight disease.', '[54 FRITH STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND. THE OFFICE OF DR. JOHN SNOW.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo street addresses come up in the 1700s and they made all sorts of new things possible. And one of the first things they revolutionized was our approach to public health. So can you tell me how addresses related to the cholera epidemic in London?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nA doctor called John Snow, this is in the Victorian London, he was actually a very prestigious doctor, but he lived actually right next to a slum. And when a case of cholera broke out in London, he was able to track the cholera in the slum. At the time there was no germ theory of disease, but he had this idea that it was spreading through water, and he was basically able to get death certificates, get people’s addresses, do some shoe-leather work himself, and trace where everybody was. And then, they sort of were clumping around this pump. John Snow took off the handle, or not John Snow himself, the government took off the handle of the pump. The cholera epidemic goes away. He was able to use the location and disease to find the source of the cholera, but speaking to modern epidemiologists, I learned that actually what John Snow did in two days in Victorian London is actually impossible in huge swaths of the world today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. You mentioned the book that countries without good address systems have a much harder time fighting disease, and you bring up Haiti as an example. Tell me what happened there.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nThere was a terrible earthquake, as we all know, in Haiti in 2010, which was followed by a vicious case of cholera that spread throughout the country. And when I spoke to logisticians at Doctors Without Borders who were coordinating the response to the epidemic, basically they weren’t able to track down their patients in the same way that John Snow could track down the patients in this London slum, which severely hindered their ability to stop the spread of the disease. So, it’s a complicated story, but basically, if you don’t have a way of finely tracking where people are, you don’t have a way of finely tracking where disease is.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAddresses have a lot of positive effects, like tracing disease, and they make it possible for the government to provide services and things like that, but they also give the state a lot of power, and that power can be abused. So could you talk about the tyranny of addresses so to speak?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYes. In the book I talk about the example of Austria during the Habsburg Empire, during the reign of Maria Teresa, who had an issue, a problem, which is that she was fighting all these wars and she needed good strong men to fight in the wars, but she was having trouble finding them. So she ended up sending out the military to number the houses in her kingdom, and while doing so, taking a kind of census. And people did not like these house numbers. And it makes a lot of sense when you think about it, especially if you’ve never had a number before, because numbering is, as there’s a scholar named Anton Tantner who’s written about this extensively, it’s dehumanizing, nobody likes to think of themselves as a number, but also it has this function of if you were able to live your life in relative privacy, and then suddenly you’re revealed to the state by a number painted on your wall. There is something deeply upsetting in this. So this was a good thing in a sense to get numbered because often this ushered in positive changes like taxes and getting around, and people loved the post, but there are downsides to this as well because now the state can find you, it can imprison you. There are all sorts of negative aspects to being found as anyone who’s ever received junk mail or solicitations can know in a milder form. The story of what happened in Austria, and also across Europe as house numbers came up, is a story basically of the conflicting views we have about the state being able to find us and identify us.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI had never really considered the sinister side of addresses until a little while ago actually. I had a friend of mine who was a journalist for a long time in Cambodia, the government was trying to impose addresses in parts of Cambodia who within living memory had genocide and a purge of people. And the citizenry there was like, “(beep) that.” Like, “I do not want the government to have any knowledge of where I am,” and it kind of blew my mind because I thought of addresses… I mean, I really didn’t think of them at all. I thought of them as neutral things. Did you notice, in your research, that depending on how benevolently you viewed the government and viewed type of control, how people took to the concept of addresses versus people who didn’t have that experience?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nIt sounds very familiar to me. And so the way I got started on this whole project, the first thing I wrote about was about West Virginia, about a very rural county in West Virginia called McDowell County, which at the time had no street addresses. The state embarked on a huge project to give them street addresses. And so I went and I interviewed lots and lots of people. In some ways, it started out sort of like a quirky story, because people would fight over naming their street, Crunchy Granola Road, or there was a street, one official told me where a certain kind of older lady lived on that was called Cougar Lane. First, it was quite quirky, but then you started hearing stories about people who really didn’t want addresses, and you talk to the addressing coordinators, and they actually found their work really difficult. And there were reports of people coming out and meeting addressers with machetes in their back pockets. And people often would say, “Oh, those are just…,” you know, they would see them as being ignorant or backwards, but you know what, the more I read about addresses, the more I realized that they knew what a lot of other people didn’t knew that these addresses weren’t just designed as they were being pitched to provide emergency services. Even though that’s extremely important, I’m not denying that that’s not an excellent reason to give addresses, but they knew there were other benefits to the government of being able to finally track its citizens. This was seen as a violent act actually exposing them to the eye of the state. So I guess a lot of it comes down to how much you trust your government as well. And obviously, in the example you gave, if you’re a dissident, or you’re someone who the government’s not going to like for whatever reason, you’re probably not going to like addresses either.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nToday it’s believed that over a billion people in the world do not have an address. That includes people without a home and residents of small towns and encampments. And not having an address creates a lot of problems.', '[NO FIXED ADDRESS]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo you make a case that having an address is actually an equity issue, not about just having a home, but like having an address. So what does an address give you access to?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nWell, this really comes up when I was researching homelessness, because in my head, I was like, who are the people who don’t have addresses? And obviously, it’s people without homes. And one thing I found from talking to experts in homelessness, but also activists, was that when people are asked, when people without homes are asked, what do you need? Well, by definition, they need a home, but what a lot of them said was they needed an address. And so there were stories of people saying that basically what they needed was a way of pretending that they weren’t homeless. When you apply for jobs, it lists address. Even though there’s no way you’re going to get mail to this address, or employer’s going to show up at your door, but they said they needed an address, even if they were just called.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And when you’re homeless, it’s hard enough to get a job, but you can’t even apply for a job in many cases. When they have these mandatory address lines on an application form.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nThe World Bank has seen addresses as one of the cheapest ways of lifting people out of poverty because if you give people addresses, they have a way of pretending that they aren’t homeless and a way of accessing all kinds of services. So to go back to your question, there’s all sorts of things you can’t do. You’ll struggle to get a bank account, you’ll struggle to vote. Where I live in England, if there’s a national health service, almost all communication is done through letters. And when I was researching this, I was calling up GP practices to find out how you register while being homeless, and even though I am a person with a home, I found it incredibly difficult to even pretend for my investigating into homelessness. I found that incredibly difficult.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIs there a way to level the playing field for people without addresses?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYeah. So one of the proposals that’s been made is something called “Ban the Address,” which has been modeled on this “Ban the Box” movement in the US, and by the “box” it means not allowing employers to ask about your criminal history. Basically stopping people from discriminating at first glance against someone, and there’s something similar to “Ban the Address.” There’s no reason that employers need your address. At least at those early stages of the interview process. There’s also a very clever way that’s begun to come up with in England, by a man named Chris Hildrey, where he’s basically teaming up with Royal Mail to use the addresses of empty homes. So that if you could just be assigned the address of an empty home, and you could use this and the mail does not go to the house, even if the home gets moved into it doesn’t matter. It’s the same way as if you move, your mail gets forwarded for months and the people currently living there will have no idea this is happening. And so people can get the letters that they need, but they can also use it as a shield showing to people that they have an address, which sometimes becomes a proxy for a productive member of society.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA street address can indicate that someone’s been fortunate in life. Many streets like Park Avenue in New York have become associated with luxury and prestige, while others have developed reputations as bad neighborhoods, reputations that are sometimes totally unfair.', '[ONE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR BOULEVARD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere are hundreds of Martin Luther King streets in America. They’re often in neighborhoods that are less well off. Why is that? What is the cycle that has created the idea and the stigma of Martin Luther King?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nI think the estimate now is 900 streets named after Martin Luther King Jr in America today, and they’re often interestingly enough, in the American South right next to the names of Confederate generals, and commemorating a street after Martin Luther King, who was obviously the most prominent icon of the civil rights movement, largely it was black communities that named streets after Martin Luther King as a way of commemorating him. Sometimes they were put in neighborhoods to “inspire” the residents, I put inspire in quotes. But in some of these situations, these were neighborhoods that weren’t particularly nice, to put a point on it, because of the forces of racism and poverty. And this meant that the name, for some people, was entrenched with this idea of poverty and crime. And it’s why Chris Rock, in his standup, had a routine in which I’m paraphrasing, but if you find yourself on Martin Luther King Jr Street, run.', 'Chris Rock:', '\\n“It ain’t the safest place to be. You can’t call nobody tell them you lost on MLK. ‘I’m lost, I’m on Martin Luther King.’ Run! Run! Run!”The media’s there.”', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nEverybody laughed. I admit, I’m Black myself, I laughed as well. But in a lot of ways, it’s not funny at all. And sometimes you can track MLK streets and find out about Black America, but also you can find about the perception of Black America as well because one thing I found in my research was that there are researchers, for example, who have found that if you compare the economic fortunes of streets named after Martin Luther King with streets named after JFK or even with just main streets, MLK streets aren’t that much economically worse off. They’re different. They have more churches for example, or they have more schools because these are white-collar jobs that were open to Black people, but they weren’t any worse. And one of the conclusions that I come to when I write about this, is that, yes, a lot of these streets have suffered, but also perhaps we think of MLK Jr streets as dangerous streets because they’re Black streets, and we’re always going to associate Black streets with being dangerous, and poor, and neglected. And thinking about that is another way of thinking about race in America today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nToday more and more streets around the world are named after famous people from history, and this is why street names have become a proxy for so many arguments about who we are and what we stand for.', '[THE BRITISH EMBASSY AT FERDOWSI AVENUE AND BOBBY SANDS STREET, TEHRAN]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the stories that really fascinated me in the book was about the Bobby Sands Street in Tehran. And there’s this incredible tense history between the UK and Iran, and making a Bobby Sands Street seems like a real provocation. How did it end up that there’s a Bobby Sands Street in Tehran?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYeah, it’s interesting. There is a Bobby Sands Street in Tehran, which is right by the British Embassy, and for anybody who doesn’t know, Bobby Sands was a hunger striker in Northern Ireland, a member of the Irish Republican Army. And so it was an unusual name to have in Tehran, especially by the British Embassy because the British really were Bobby Sands’s enemies. I’d heard the story about these teenage boys who had changed it. So I tracked one of them down who told me this amazing story that after the revolution, there were a lot of young people who were very politically involved, including himself. He’d gotten involved in politics at a very young age, and they were fairly wealthy residents of Tehran, so they were in quite a fancy neighborhood near the British Embassy, and they had this idea that they were going to change the names. It sounds to me as a bit like “Stranger Things.” They’re all on their bikes, going to the hardware store, and they buy this glue that they have to powder and mix water in, and they’re basically able to mimic signs. And they change the signs to read Bobby Sands Street. And this would’ve been shortly after Bobby Sands died after his hunger strike. The city later ratified it. And there’s Bobby Sands Street and weirdly enough for a hunger striker, there’s a Bobby Sands Burger Bar.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh my God.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nAlso in Tehran. And the reason I found this fascinating was that it’s just a light on commemoration. Why does this matter? And in fact, we know it does matter because the British Embassy actually ended up opening up a new entrance so that they didn’t have to be on Bobby Sands Street, which I believe used to be Winston Churchill Street. So they could have a new address because obviously they cared. So it sort of opens this window of what commemoration means and why we care so much really.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. They were angry at the British Empire, and they knew that Bobby Sands would be a finger in their eye basically. Just like it just would poke them.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYeah. So there’s Bobby Sands Street Tehran, but there’s Bobby Sands streets all over the world. I think I counted five in France, for example.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nBut the interesting thing I found was that there aren’t any actually in Ireland. So this is actually sort of a fascinating idea that you have this fighter who, for a lot of people, depending on your belief system, would have been a martyr and a great man, and yet you have all these names named after him elsewhere, but you don’t have any in Ireland. And basically the explanation I came to is that Ireland doesn’t have any consensus on Bobby Sands. Up close, his legacy is a lot more complicated than it was for those teenage boys in Iran. This whole idea of commemorating is really trying to figure out what we’re about and what Ireland has said by not giving a Bobby Sands Street, is that at this point, at least that’s not what they’re about. Bobby Sands’s Ireland is not today’s Ireland. And that’s really for me why there is no street named after Bobby Sands in Ireland. Or north or south.', '[2211 FREEDOM STREET, HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo right now there are lots of arguments about street names, especially in the US where they’re named after Confederate generals and historical figures like Christopher Columbus, and you spent months covering street names in Hollywood, Florida in particular. So what was happening in Hollywood, Florida when you were there?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nYeah. Well, in Hollywood, Florida, there were parts of the city that were historically Black. Part of the city called Liberia had three street names that were named after Confederate generals. And the worst of them of all, in the eyes of campaigners, was Nathan Bedford Forrest street. People knew who Nathan Bedford Forrest was, he was not only, he was not only a major figure in the Confederate War, but he was also seen as one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan. And so you have these street names, not only in this part of Hollywood, Florida, that was really intended for Black people, when Black people weren’t allowed to live in integrated areas. And so there was an activist, a man who actually just recently passed away I’m sad to say, named Benjamin Israel, a really interesting man who’s from New York. He’s African-American, but also Orthodox Jewish. And he basically, just for months, just appeared at a city council meeting. And I watched many of these things where he would be talking about these street names while everybody else was talking about Airbnb regulations. And finally, it really started to click, and eventually they did overturn them. And it really, in a lot of ways exposed a lot of racism, but also a lot of other feelings about street names in the battle. And for me, one of the most interesting things was I’m African-American, in the book in general, I try to stay fairly neutral about these things, but I’m not really neutral on this. I thought the street names should change, but it was interesting hearing the other side. And I listened to many speeches about this, that there were people who would say things like, “I live on Lee Street named after Robert E. Lee, and I don’t care anything about Robert E. Lee but I met my husband on Lee street. My babies were born on Lee street. I want it to be Lee street.” In my head, I connected to that which makes a lot of sense, because in our brain we do tend to connect places in memory. So it makes sense to me. I’m not actually promoting Lee. I just liked the name Lee. And I think that now the conversation’s changed and it’s like, we can’t just rest on this nostalgia argument. Even if you say you’re not actually racist, and I actually believe this. I don’t actually think this, for a lot of these people, this was a show of racism, but just it’s this idea now that I think people are having to say, “Well, we just have to change them. You have to take action to change them,” which I think was often missing. But in Hollywood, Florida, they did change the street names.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And so what did you think of the solution of Hollywood, Florida? They didn’t replace like Robert E. Lee Street with like civil rights icons. They replaced them with like Freedom Street and Hope Streets. So what do you think of that outcome?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nThis became a debate as well over the course of the talk because people wanted to name it after an activist, for example, who helped integrate beaches in Florida and the like. And there was even a suggestion at some point by one council member to just number the streets, obviously an American solution. And then nobody wanted that either. And then I would think about it. I was like, “Well, why is that?” So, I mean, just thinking about it from an objective standpoint, why is that such a bad solution to number streets? And the reason is that the street names have become like monuments. A way where we preserve our memories, and there’ve been a lot of historians, Pierre Nora comes to mind. If you talk about history moving incredibly quickly, this idea of the acceleration of history, that things just change so fast that we really have to start salting away and packing away our memories into things so that we don’t forget when things start to change again. And I think that’s why suggestions, like numbering don’t fly because it’s not just that people don’t want Robert E. Lee’s name down, they want to make a statement, and they want their street names to make a statement. So it’s not simply about the taking down, it’s the putting up as well. And so Hope, Liberty, and Freedom ended up being something that united people in some sense. But yes, the bolder move would have been to actually name it after an activist who actually fought against the principles that the Confederate generals were aiming for.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And you think that solution is okay? Like that compromise of Freedom, Hope, and Liberty?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nI mean, yeah. It’s interesting. I mean, it’s not really for me to say whether it’s okay or not, but at the same time, people often decry, they say these arguments are terrible. I mean, I like these arguments. As I say in the book, arguments divide communities, but they make communities as well. If we didn’t have these arguments, if they simply numbered it, if they simply changed it. I think actually there’s a lot to be gained from people talking and listening. Even now, I know people don’t often listen, but there’s engagement there, there’s an exposure there. We’re trying to decide what these things mean for our society. For Hollywood, they decided that Hope, Liberty, and Freedom would be great. I mean, obviously, in a lot of ways, I think it would have been even better had they pushed it further from my own personal perspective. But I do like that there’s this process through street names often that exposes what people believe and what they believe their community’s about, and I think that’s valuable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs more of our life becomes digital, are our physical addresses becoming obsolete? More with Deirdre Mask after this.', '[BREAK]', '[SOAK, HEAVY, POUNDS. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA]', 'Roman Mars: We don’t really need actresses anymore. You mentioned this, that there are ways to get a driver’s license or pay your taxes. You can do a lot of stuff online. Could you imagine a world without addresses in the future?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nOh, yeah. No, I absolutely could. And I mean, you can imagine in some developing countries that they’re going to bypass addresses altogether for something more digital. Yeah, and there are lots of companies that are really doing that. Google’s gotten an app. They’ve got a, you know, a great sort of digital system. There’s this company I describe called “What 3 Words” which is giving addresses in just three basically random words that they’ve mapped the whole world. So I can in some ways imagine it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCould you describe “What 3 Words” and how it serves as an alternative to physical addresses?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nBasically, this company has divided up the world. I believe it’s three meters-by-three meter squares. But I could be wrong about that. But very small chunks. And they’ve basically given every single one of these squares a three-word address. It’s not a street name like we think of. They’ve given it three words. So I clicked on a random spot not too far from where I live. That’s “create”, “door”, “statue”, you know, three entirely random words. And the point of this is that you can isolate things much, much quicker, you know, just three meters-by-three meters. And also you can find things that generally don’t have addresses like the middle of a park. You know, if you’re on a hike and you want to map out where you took a picture, you can use the What 3 Words address. But they’ve also been used in places that don’t have addresses. So they’ve been used, for example, in Mongolia, where there isn’t the traditional street addressing system that we’re familiar with, say, in the U.S.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd you can remember it because you can remember three words pretty easily, as opposed to like some map coordinates, which are very long and abstract strings of numbers. But what is the limitation of something like “What 3 Words”?', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nWell, I mean, one of the limitations, I think, of all of this is that I spoke earlier about how, you know, the state was in control of addresses, but in a lot of ways, we tended to trust states more than we trust companies. I mean, let’s see if that’s true anymore. But in general, in general, we do have this idea. So you have a company like “What 3 words”, which I think has come up with this sort of brilliant invention. But they are a private company. This “What 3 Words” technology is bound up in patents. Using it, you can’t use them as freely as you could use your addresses.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Deirdre Mask:', '\\nIt does mean that you’re sort of beholden to a private company to find out where you are, in a little ways. And something about that makes me really uncomfortable. Also, it takes away the meaning. You know, we talked all about these commemorative street names that, you know, how street names have meaning for better, for worse. You know, addresses are sort of the way we navigate the world and we connect ourselves to other people. So one problem with a lot of these digital addresses is that you become a string of numbers or, in “What 3 Words” case, a string of words that don’t connect us to our neighbors or don’t connect us to our communities. So I think it has many uses, especially for places that don’t have traditional addresses or for these other uses. But I still would like to hold firm to our traditional addresses.', '———', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Chris Berube. Music by Sean Real.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOver the past month, we’ve all had to make some adjustments to try to stop the spread of COVID-19. Some of them have been small like me recording this episode underneath the comforter in my bedroom instead of in our studio in beautiful, downtown Oakland, California. I mean, that experience is unique to me, but another adjustment that I’ve made and one that you probably had to make too, is wearing a mask in public. If you’ve been paying attention to the directives about where and when or even who should be wearing masks, then there’s a good chance you’ve been a little confused because they’ve changed dramatically. Here in the U.S., we’re just not used to needing to cover half our faces in public. But if you look at the other side of the world, it’s a different story. In parts of Asia, a mask in response to the coronavirus pandemic was a totally easy and normal adjustment. Rebecca Kanthor is a reporter based in Shanghai who has lived in China for the past 17 years. She’s here to tell us why the culture of masks developed so differently there, and the doctor who started it all.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nI remember the first time I really started taking this seriously, I was traveling on my way home to see my in-laws actually, for Chinese New Year. The night before I’d gone out, everything was normal. And then that morning, I walked out the door and I put the location on my GPS app on my phone. And you know how on your phone, the GPS app will tell you in this like nice calm voice, which direction to start off in?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMm-hmm, yeah.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nWell, this time my GPS app said this. (Chinese language audio)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo it’s saying, “please wear a mask if you’re going out. Be safe.”.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. I don’t think my GPS has ever been quite that intimate with me before.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. My phone has never gotten that personal with me before. It’s like totally weird. So it stuck with me. And then, after I heard that, then I was looking around. I started noticing everyone around me on the street was wearing a mask. It was like between the day before and that day, a switch had been flipped. Everyone knew exactly what to do. So a week later, I got back to Shanghai and the change was just even more drastic. People weren’t going outside. But anyone who did go outside was wearing a mask. And there were posters all over reminding people to wear masks. And I was riding my bike one day and I passed this loudspeaker with a voice that was just like on a loop reminding people to wear a mask. (Chinese language audio) And so the thing is, everyone has to wear a mask. But at that time, you couldn’t buy one anywhere. Like the pharmacies were all sold out. I mean, I tried online.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo does that mean that everyone just already had a mask?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, I guess. I mean, I think people had masks at home. So, I mean, eventually, a friend gave me some which was really nice. But the whole experience got me wondering, how come everybody else was so prepared? And I’m like the only idiot, got caught off guard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, right. It seems like, you’re from the US and I’m here in the U.S. And we just seem to have a very different relationship with masks in general.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. I mean, it’s nothing that I counted as something I should keep in my first aid kit at home. But I guess everyone else here was doing that.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so why do you think that is? Why does China have a different relationship with masks?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nI was really curious about that. So I started looking into the history of masks in China. And it turns out they’ve been used here for a really long time. So, Roman, I sent you a photo on the Zoom chat. Do you have it there?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. So this is a black and white photo. It’s a couple of people wearing big white mass. Like everything is kind of covered except for the eyes. But it’s a little thicker and gauze here than the ones that you might see people wearing around today. But it’s basically the same principle. You know, it’s a mask. So when was this photo taken?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo this photo is from over 100 years ago when China was the scene of another devastating epidemic, the Great Manchurian Plague.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh wow. Ok.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nManchuria at the time was contested territory. It’s where northeast China is today. And in 1910, it became the site of a really deadly outbreak of plague. Ninety-five percent or more of those that got infected died. And they died fast, within just a few days of contracting [it]. And this outbreak was really well documented, especially in photographs.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nIt was the first time that you had cameras that could readily cover an epidemic. But also, it was the first time that newspapers could carry these images, you know, could carry good quality photographic images.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo this is Christos Lynteris. He’s a medical anthropologist at University of St. Andrews in the UK, and he said that at that time photos of the outbreak in Manchuria were seen in newspapers around the world.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nAnd photography played a key role in establishing this ideal global outbreak, an outbreak which is spreading across the globe.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo a lot of these photographs were quite graphic scenes of victims, but there were also a lot of photographs of people wearing masks like the one I showed you.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nAnd at the center of these photography is the mask. Now, why the mask? Masks have been used before, for surgery. So I think the official history of the mask in a clinical setting or on the operation theater dates back from around 1897. But masks have never been systematically used in an epidemic before.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo masks had been used by doctors, but they weren’t being used by the general public at this point.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nRight. But that changed in Manchuria because of one guy. His name was Wu Lien-teh. Dr. Wu was a young Chinese Malaysian doctor who’d gone abroad to study medicine in Europe. He was actually the first ethnic Chinese person to study at Cambridge. The Qing Dynasty government called them in to lead the Chinese efforts against the plague since it was an international effort. He was surrounded by all these much more experienced doctors from Russia, Japan, France, Great Britain. And he was only in his early 30s, but he was really smart.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nAnd he was a brilliant scientist. He soon came across people with symptoms and he concluded, okay, this is pneumonic plague and he had this idea that it spread in an airborne manner.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo meaning it spread from droplets in the air coming from people’s noses or mouths.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd was this a new idea? I mean, how did people think it was being spread at the time?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nWell, you know, there’s different kinds of plague. There’s bubonic and septicemic. Those ones are spread by fleas from small animals. And at the time, most of the experts thought that was how this plague was spreading. But Dr. Wu, he figured out that this outbreak was a different kind of plague. I mean, he was treating all these people with respiratory symptoms and he was convinced that the plague bacteria was spreading through the air. And he’s right about it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWay to go, Dr. Wu.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. And so he made it like it seemed like a simple suggestion. Everyone should start covering their mouth and noses with face masks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Which is the suggestion that we’re all getting today to stop the spread of coronavirus.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nRight. But that was the first time someone had suggested that. And he was really serious about this idea. He designed face masks himself. And so I talked with this historian at Shanghai Library. Her name’s Vivian Huang. And she’s been researching the history of Wu’s mask. And she was telling me about how it was designed. She speaks Chinese so I’m just gonna translate what she said.', 'Vivian Huang:', '\\n(Speaking in Chinese)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nShe said it was this basic gauze mask with two layers. And in-between the layers there was about a four-by-six inch piece of cotton that was about a half-inch thick. And then there were these two strings to tie the mask behind your head. And all of these materials were really cheap and easy to find at the time.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nSo it was something that was meant to be very simple, very easy and cheap to produce and which he envisioned that all his doctors, all his nurses and all his sanitary staff should use while engaged in anti-plague operations. And he wants the general public to wear these masks, as well.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nBut the other doctors in Manchuria at the time, they wouldn’t listen to him. I mean, maybe it was because he was young or maybe because China at that time wasn’t really known for its scientific prowess. They just didn’t believe him.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOr maybe it’s because they’re racist.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nNo. But even the local leaders were suspicious of him. I mean, he was just… Nobody believed him. And I think it was because he was kind of a nobody compared to all these famous European and Japanese doctors.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nSo they antagonized him very, very actively. And there is this incident which he recounts in his autobiography, which is called “The Plague Fighter,” where he is confronted by a famous French doctor Gerald Mesny. And Mesny hears Wu expounding his airborne plague theory and he humiliates him in a very racist manner. And then Mesny goes on to operate in one of the hospitals to attend the sick without wearing what Wu had suggested is an essential device, which is the mask.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo I think you can guess where this is going…', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nUnfortunately for the French doctor, he dies soon after. Catches plague and he dies. So Wu is suddenly and completely unexpectedly, for most people, vindicated.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. That is dramatic.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. I mean, we don’t know if the mask would have saved him, but after he died, it was just this huge case in point that proved that Wu had been right.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nSo the moment when Mesny dies and basically everyone starts accepting Wu’s theory, this mask goes virally.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI don’t know if I’ll ever be able to use that phrase quite the same way as I used to, but I get his point. At this point, it just spreads everywhere.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nExactly. I mean, it was reported on all over the world. The Manchurian Plague ended after seven months. Some people say it ended because spring came and the weather warmed up. But Dr. Wu claimed victory because of the recommendations he made to stop its spread: wearing masks, quarantining sick patients, cutting off the Trans-Siberian railway lines. But Dr. Wu’s mask became the symbol for successfully controlling the outbreak.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nEveryone wants the mask and everyone starts photographing the mask. And the mask becomes this kind of a symbol of scientific success and medical ability to cope with this dreadful disease in Manchuria. And Wu is praised, of course, as a genius in having invented it. So it’s a huge success story for Wu. And he came out of this as, you know, the guy who is internationally recognized as having controlled the epidemic, which was astonishing because he was a nobody until then and he was competing with very, very famous doctors.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nDr. Wu went on to form China’s first organization dealing with disease control. And then later he formed the Chinese Medical Association. His work is the basis for China’s disease control and public health system today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd do people remember him today? I mean, did he get the recognition that he deserved?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nWell, I mean, in 1935, he was nominated for a Nobel Prize.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, that’s pretty good.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nBut today, he never became a household name, not even in China. I mean, yeah, people don’t know him.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nBut still, you know, he’s one of the most significant epidemiologists of the 20th century. So it’s a shame that he’s not better known.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what happens with Wu’s mask after the Manchurian Plague? Where does it go?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nWell, Dr. Wu’s design inspired others around the world to try their hand at mask design, too.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nAnd so there were competing models. It becomes kind of a medical competition and design competition for the best mask. It’s the holy grail of that epidemic – who is going to produce the best mask, the most efficient mask. And some of them are really kind of weird things. They look like, I don’t know, like a diver’s suit or something. Others are more simple, but Wu’s is the one which prevails.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nOne of the key things, I think, about the design was that it was disposable. So it didn’t need to be disinfected. Some of the other designs were just too complicated.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. That makes sense.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo seven years later, when the 1918 flu epidemic hit, masks similar to the ones that Dr. Wu designed started being used around the world.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nThis was a device that caused globally recognized by doctors as well as the late public as a necessary and efficient anti-contagion device. I don’t know how easy it would have been to make people accept these masks and adopt them if it had not been part of a recent outbreak that had been successfully controlled.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nAnd during the 1918 flu, Americans wore masks a lot like Dr. Wu’s. Nancy Tome is a history professor at SUNY Stony Brook and she’s written a lot about the epidemic. She told me about all these great photos of Americans wearing masks during the flu epidemic.', 'Nancy Tomes:', '\\nSo there’s this really wonderful picture of a baseball game in Pasadena, California. And you can see the umpire, the catcher and the pitcher, who’s up to bat, all wearing masks and then behind them, you can see the spectators also wearing masks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if people were wearing them during a baseball game… like I can barely wear one on a brisk walk for a couple blocks… So, does this mean that everyone was wearing masks at this point?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nOkay, so to be fair, I think that was the only baseball game where people wore masks. It was reported as the first baseball game where players wore masks and it was probably also the last one.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it was a little bit of propaganda to get people to wear masks.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, it was for show. Professor Tome said that these photos are mostly police officers, nurses, but also baseball players and society ladies. They were meant to convince more people to wear masks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo they were like Instagram influencers.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nTotally. Totally. So, this time around during this pandemic, I’ve been seeing news items on social media, photos from back in the 1918 pandemic. And you see these photos and I guess it’s easy to assume that everyone was wearing the mask. But Professor Tome says we shouldn’t assume that it was that universal.', 'Nancy Tomes:', '\\nI don’t want to call it an elite practice, but a specialized practice. So you’re going to find it amongst certain groups and they’re wearing it now that it’s going to be replicated as a way to make everybody feel calmer and safer. But was the expectation that every American should go around with a gauze mask? I don’t think that happened.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nStill, local health officials were calling on people to wear masks. And in some cities, there were mask ordinances. So if you were caught without one, you were fined or you went to jail. And women were being called upon to sew masks for the cause.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, which is another thing you see today.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo right after that 1918 pandemic ended, Americans kind of stopped using masks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it was just kind of like this blip in American history where it wasn’t unusual to wear a mask.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, masks basically fell into obscurity in the U.S. after that. I mean, there were other epidemics throughout the 20th century, but they weren’t spread by coughing and sneezing in the U.S. But in China, there was never a chance for people to forget masks for too long.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nFirst of all, in China, you have a continuity of the use of the mask, right? So the mask story does not end in 1911 or 1918. It continues, you know, through several other outbreaks in the 20s, in the 30s, and then in Mao’s China after ’49. Again, the mask plays an important role in public health campaigns. You see the masks in a great number of public health propaganda posters.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nI think this is kind of an important point. A lot of folks would say that wearing a mask is kind of a cultural thing in China. I think that’s kind of true. But Vivian Huang was telling me that it’s only normalized in China because they were required to wear them by the state.', 'Vivian Huang:', '\\n(Speaking in Chinese)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nHuang told me that public health campaigns on neighborhood chalkboards or posters on telephone poles, all promoted wearing masks. And in the 20s and 30s, Shanghai newspapers, they published articles and cartoons that tried to popularize the use of masks. And women’s magazines showed masks as kind of like a status symbol. And there were these magazine articles teaching readers how to knit their own masks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI’m falling for this fashion thing as well because I have a kind of a more technical store-bought mask like an N95, leftover from the wildfires of California. But I also have a handmade one, and it might not have the efficacy of the manufactured one but I like wearing it more because it’s prettier. (laughs)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nExactly. You’re more willing to wear something that you like the way it looks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, sure.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nAnyway, through it all Dr. Wu’s gauze mask design or something similar to it survived. And then if we flash forward to the 2002 SARS epidemic, again masks appeared. Doctors were wearing surgical masks. But Vivian Huang remembers seeing people on the streets wearing masks similar to the ones that Dr. Wu designed.', 'Vivian Huang:', '\\n(Speaking in Chinese)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nBack then, she says she was a student. She was stuck on lockdown on her university campus in Shanghai. And once again, there were public health campaigns on hand-washing and wearing masks. And she says that’s why this time around, everyone remembered and knew what to do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s not exactly that people in China are more inclined culturally to wear masks. They just had more occasions in recent history to wear masks and so they know what to do. They know what the deal is.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, exactly. But that’s not to say it’s been easy for Chinese people to get used to wearing masks. I mean, even this time around, at first, older people really resisted.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. That’s kind of happened here too, where we’re trying to convince or boomer parents to stay in because we’re fearful they would die.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, and it’s the same thing. I mean, younger people here were telling me that at first, they were really having to nag their parents and grandparents to wear masks. And they were joking that they had to nag their older relatives with the same intensity that they were being nagged to get married.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n(laughs) So like, direct and relentless.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nExactly. They’re calling up their family every day saying, “please wear a mask, please wear a mask.” So, yeah, Vivian Huang told me it’s really taken Chinese people 100 years to get to this point of acceptance of wearing masks during an infectious disease outbreak. And now it’s to the point where people will just wear them when they’ve got a cold. It’s just normal here.', 'Vivian Huang:', '\\n(Speaking in Chinese)', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nShe said at least wearing a mask is not strange. You wear it in the winter to keep warm or to protect from pollution or be it a cold. It’s a normalized daily behavior, and no one would look at you strangely for choosing to wear one.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And that really wasn’t the case here in the U.S. I mean, if you were wearing a mask before all this, people would wonder why.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nIt seems like that’s really starting to change in the past couple weeks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. I mean, now I would say that maybe like 80% of the people in stores are wearing masks and even walking along the street. I mean, the strange thing is that in the Bay Area, we actually have a little bit of a history of wearing N95 masks because there’s wildfires here every year. And so it’s not uncommon for people to have a couple in their home to deal with smoke. So I think we were more ready to take on masks. But I’ve never seen them like this. I mean, it’s totally like people are wearing every type of thing – homemade masks, N95 masks. They’re really everywhere.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. That’s quite different from the past because I’ve been hearing from Asian-American friends that there was real trepidation about wearing a mask in public because the culture of masks is so different or has been so different in the U.S. I think there was a lot of fear about how they would be perceived wearing a mask and Professor Lynteris talked about this.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nThe masks have become very aggressively and viciously racialized. Right? They’re associated with China, with Chinese people in a very sinophobic manner.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nSo sinophobia is basically racism towards ethnically Chinese people.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nAnd so you have this phenomenon where which some journalists call that mask-ophobia, which is basically an attribute of sinophobia. People being attacked, like people who look Chinese or who look Asian, being attacked on the streets of London and other places because they’re wearing masks.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nProfessor Lynteris says this kind of insidious racism isn’t even recognized by most people. But it’s always been connected with disease.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nSo from the very birth of sinophobia in modern Europe and America, sinophobia has been connected with this idea of epidemics coming from China and being spread by Chinese people. And I think that the mask and mask-ophobia is tied to these racist and xenophobic attitudes.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nBut in China, there’s no mask-ophobia. It’s people who aren’t wearing masks during this pandemic that are seen as strange.', 'Christos Lynteris:', '\\nIt is the baseline, as it were, of self-protection. But more importantly, it’s not so much about protecting yourself against being infected. It is more of protecting others.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think this is something I didn’t really fully appreciate at the beginning of all this. I think I had this instinct that when people were in masks before that they were trying to protect themselves. They were really worried about their own health when it came to a pandemic. But the truth is, it’s like the opposite of that. Like they have a little bit of cold and they don’t spread it to you. A mask does a really good job of keeping them from spreading that to you. They’re protecting me.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nExactly. They’re being conscientious.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo have you gotten used to wearing a mask regularly?', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nI mean, it’s definitely not fun to wear a mask. I’m not going to lie. I have glasses. Wearing masks-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is the worst. It’s the worst.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah, it’s tough. My glasses are always fogged up. And I hated wearing them on polluted days in Shanghai. They made me feel really depressed. But during this outbreak, I’m really surprised. They do not make me feel depressed. And I feel like seeing everyone around me wearing a mask, I feel like a sense of solidarity. I mean, I can’t see their face. I can’t see their whole face. But I feel like we’re telling each other, “I’m watching out for you.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nAnd I’m paying much more attention to people’s eyes because that’s how I can tell what their expression is.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. You can see that they’re smiling.', 'Rebecca Kanthor:', '\\nYeah. So, I mean, when I see other people wearing a mask, I feel like it’s a reminder that we’re all in this together.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up, individual people are not the only ones changing their habits to deal with coronavirus. Manufacturers are also finding themselves in uncharted waters, switching to produce the masks and gowns and ventilators that we need so desperately. Some stories of the great manufacturing pivot of 2020 after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbout three weeks ago, Tyler Mantel was in a Home Depot at 6 am, taking his first steps in trying to solve a huge global problem.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nJust looking at just a wall of parts and pieces and hoses, just trying to figure out what I could put together to put together a baseline ventilator.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nA mechanical ventilator that could assist someone who has trouble breathing because they have COVID-19.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nAny time you’re starting a design process, you need something. As you’re communicating with teams, the first thing you put together allows people to understand direction. It defines things you never thought you’d define. So just having a physical construct can always be very helpful.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Tyler and his colleagues are in the Home Depot and none of the stuff on the wall is designed for ventilators.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nStaring at a wall of one-way valves for PET connections, like they didn’t fit on to what we’re using at all. They were silly and they were the wrong pressure. Everything was wrong about it, but we needed to understand what it is we were working with. It was interesting. It was a throwback to the scene in Apollo 13.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is the scene where the mission control technicians have to figure out how to fit a square filter into a round hole using only the items that can be found in the Apollo 13 spacecraft or all the astronauts are going to die.', '\\nApollo 13 Clip: “Okay people, listen up. The people upstairs handed us this one and we gotta come through. We gotta find a way to make this fit into the hole for this using nothing but that.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nDamn, that’s the greatest scene in movie history anyway.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nWe just started throwing stuff in a cart. I think I put 150, 200 bucks on my credit card and ran a bunch of stuff to a lab and we started piling things together until it made our first iteration of a ventilator.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs you can tell, Tyler Mantel doesn’t normally make ventilators.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nMost of the time I make robots that swim through water pipes to find leaks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is a huge problem with old infrastructure. Twenty percent of the world’s clean water is lost to leaky pipes. But suddenly that wasn’t the most pressing problem in the world.', 'Tyler Mantel:', '\\nWhen coronavirus came and hit us like it did, the ability to travel and do some of the big projects you have coming up went away. So we started to look at what else we could do. And my co-founder of the Ventilator Project is actually also my roommate. We work in the same building and we just started talking about the fact that ventilators are going to be a huge shortage. And so I started digging into it and you start to find out that a ventilator is not a difficult product. The lack of difficulty doesn’t mean it’s easy. It means it’s straightforward.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo Tyler and his co-founder of the Ventilator Project, Alex Frost, assembled a team of over 200 remote volunteer engineers, medical, regulatory and business professionals to try and help solve the global ventilator shortage as fast as possible. And even though the details from company to company are very different, a lot of manufacturers are making a similar pivot.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nYou know, if you’re a manufacturer, that’s kind of what you’re always looking… like could we make something like that? Can we make that? That’s sort of in our blood.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou know, this is Matt Anderson, the co-founder of Sound Devices. They normally make high-end audio mixing and recording consoles.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nA couple of weeks ago, I was texting back and forth with my head of manufacturing, Lisa, and said, you know, “I wonder if we could make the ventilators or masks or something.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey ended up concentrating on face shield masks.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nI came in and talked to my sales guys and said, “Hey, do you guys want to call some hospitals and see if this is true about there being a shortage?” Because, I don’t know… And they made some calls and they came back and they said, “Yeah, definitely. Hospitals really need these badly.” So that’s, you know, a few minutes later, we just started buying parts. That was on a Monday that we started that. And then it was 32 hours later, we had the first ones coming off the end of the line.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd today, if you go to the product page on sounddevices.com, you can order a 32-channel 36-track mixer and a 100 pack of single-use medical face shields. And much like the ventilator project, when Matt described his company’s pivot to our producer, Emmet FitzGerald, who you’ll hear in the next clip, it wasn’t the technology or the know-how needed to make the product that was the hard part.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nYou take the foam, stick it on there, staple on the elastic and you’re done. It sounds really simple, but getting these three parts in volume has been difficult. So we have suppliers – it’s our normal suppliers – for the plastic shield and for the foam. Luckily, we’ve got great suppliers for them. They’re right nearby in Wisconsin and we buy them. And that’s all great. The elastic piece, that’s been kind of a nightmare to get in quantity. I’ll give you a “for instance”, last week, two of our purchasing people, Lorraine and Shin Hye, were driving all around northern Wisconsin, going from Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart and Jo-Ann’s Fabric to Jo-Ann’s Fabric, buying up all the elastic they could find.', 'Emmett FitzGerald: I feel like when you picture manufacturing, you don’t picture manufacturers driving to Jo-Ann Fabrics to get this stuff or anything.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nAnd normally you don’t, but this is a special situation, right. And so yeah….', 'Emmett FitzGerald: Right. Right.', 'Matt Anderson:', '\\nIt’s typical when you call, you say, “I want to buy this much foam.” And they say, “The lead time is six weeks.” And you go, “Okay, no problem.” You plan for that. Well, in this pandemic, six weeks does us no good.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSupply chains, regulations, and factories have to be more nimble than ever before because the virus is a moving target. Just ask Jen Guarino, CEO of the Industrial Sewing and Innovation Center in Detroit, which normally makes fashion apparel.', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nI will tell you that this has been such a quickly changing environment. At first, it was masks, masks, masks, masks. So we sampled with all these masks. All these masks. And then it was no longer masks. It was really gowns and gowns has really turned out to be the big problem and really what we’re most suited to make.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd what is an isolation gown exactly?', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nSo an isolation gown is… there’s varying degrees. And trust me when I say I have learned a lot in the last three weeks. I have. Wow. I mean, acronyms I didn’t know before, the whole thing. What makes an isolation gown is that it has particulate protection to varying degrees. So if you’re in surgery you have, you know, really tight cuffs around your wrists and tight around your neck and your highest grade material. And a level one is just sort of like a sheet that you put over that just, you know, helps you a little bit.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Industrial Sewing and Innovation Center, also known as ISAIC, was already a mission-driven company before coronavirus.', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nSo the Industrial Sewing and Innovation Center is designed to be a people-centered institute that trains people for advanced manufacturing of sewn goods, like apparel, and to do so in a way that is responsible. The fashion industry is a very polluting, irresponsible industry for the most part. It puts about forty-five billion units of garments into landfills every year before consumer. One of the solutions to changing these bad practices is to manufacture closer to home.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo instead of stores speculatively buying clothes they think will so nine months in the future, they use more advanced and local manufacturing to quickly fulfill orders on demand.', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nSo you get rid of a whole waste stream and now you have a whole resource pool that you can now allocate to paying higher wages. And being sustainable from that standpoint, we really believe that having a sustainable product is not sustainable unless the people making them have sustainable lives.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou can’t fight every battle at the same time, right? I totally get that. But how have you approached balancing your mission to the moment?', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nThat’s right. You can’t make everything first priority. So sustainability, I will have to tell you right now, it’s not our number one priority because I mean, we’re working on polypropylene and these are disposable gowns. You wear them once and you throw them out. It’s the opposite of sustainable! But you know what we have learned? We’ve learned a lot about how that stuff gets recycled. So, we’re learning as we go about these waste streams and what you can do about these waste streams. So it’s interesting that even though we’re creating more waste, we’re also understanding what you do with it when it’s done. But I think what hasn’t changed is our commitment to training people and treating people differently than they’ve been treated in a factory environment. So we’re just making different products.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo how do you physically make the factory safe so that workers can be separate and still do their jobs?', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nGood question. Yeah. So one of the things that we had to do is when you’re manufacturing in a lean way, you reduce costs by reducing the space by which you hand things to each other. So in a typical cell-', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe cell is a team of people working on different parts of an item. Once the item’s through the cell, it’s completed.', 'Jennifer Guarino:', '\\nLiterally, you have pieces of fabric that are tied together that are kind of making their way around the cell. So you’re very, very, very close. And that’s how you remain competitive. So we had to distance that. So literally what we did was we had brand new gorgeous machines that are they are programable. They’re really beautiful. And in between them, we’ve rigged these, corrugated cardboard pathways, sort of duct-taped between machines so that we can create enough distance, at least six feet, to pass the material across. And to wear masks and gloves. So it’s been this real, “just figure it out, make it work.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs we continue to navigate the pandemic, notably without the proper planning and guidance from our federal executive, relying on the ingenuity and generosity of these manufacturers to fill in the gaps, there will be a lot of “just figuring it out.” To find out more about the Ventilator Project, Sound Devices, and the Industrial Sewing and Innovation Center, go to 99pi.org.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible’s Impact Design coverage is supported by Autodesk.

I’m Roman Mars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, I’m talking with Katie Mingle, our senior producer. And you’ve been reporting for about a year and a half on homelessness here in the Bay Area for a series that we’re putting together right now. It’s not ready. It’s scheduled to come out at the end of the year but since the coronavirus crisis has a huge impact on the unhoused population. We wanted to check in.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah. So basically, just as I was starting to wrap up the reporting process, the coronavirus came and it upended everything for everyone. And I’ve been struggling with how or whether to follow any of what’s been happening in terms of COVID and homelessness. So, not really knowing what I would do with any of it, I just started kind of checking in with people just over the phone and in Zoom and whatnot, trying to at least kind of keep up with it all. And I was recording those conversations and I decided that some of them felt worth sharing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it seems that homeless people are one of the populations that people are talking about as being particularly vulnerable to this disease.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, so based on data that researchers already have about age and underlying health conditions in homeless people, a study from a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and UCLA found that homeless people would be twice as likely to be hospitalized as the general population, two to four times as likely to require critical care and two to three times as likely to die if they contracted COVID-19.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd it seems like some of the places where homeless people are the most visible, like the encampments and the shelters, are really potential petri dishes for a disease like this to spread.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, I mean social distancing is basically impossible in a shelter. And I think like all over the country, people are scrambling to prevent large scale outbreaks in homeless communities. I only know about what’s happening in California. And yeah, I just wanted to share a few voices from that struggle, I guess we’ll call it.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“The thing that is upside-down about this is normally when there’s a disaster, we work backwards. There’s an earthquake, we work backwards. There’s a flood, we work backwards. The thing happens and then we’re getting ourselves out of it. This every day we go deeper in. I don’t know where the bottom is.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThat’s Jen Loving. She’s the CEO of an organization called “Destination: Home” that in regular times works on both ending and preventing homelessness in Santa Clara County.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd Santa Clara County is like San Jose and Palo Alto and Cupertino. It’s basically when people say Silicon Valley, they mean Santa Clara County.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah. And Jen’s agency, Destination: Home, has been around since 2008. But during this pandemic, it’s basically been conscripted into this chain of command that’s been activated at the county level through something called the Emergency Operations Center. And every county in California has one of these.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“So, the Emergency Operations Center, or the EOC, gets activated when there’s an earthquake, flood, some sort of things. With the very first time though that – and I’ve been a part of an activation a couple of times in my career – this is the first time, though, that it was activated for a pandemic, which basically means that the Santa Clara County Public Health Department is in charge. If you’re working in homelessness, you’re not doing things on your own anymore, meaning supply chain, money, systems – everything gets deployed through this EOC.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nJen is essentially working under the direction of the public health department on a few different things. And those things include opening up mass shelters so that existing shelters can be less crowded, bringing sanitation and medical care and resources to encampments, and then also setting up partnerships with hotels where homeless people can potentially be quarantined.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“And then the last piece is trying to mitigate the financial catastrophe. If we can keep families from becoming homeless right now, there’s a far better chance of recovery later. So, we have to do, I think, we have to do a few things and I think those things are happening. We have to have eviction moratorium. Everywhere needs to have one. We need to make sure that there’s food – free food accessible. I think this is also already happening. But like utilities, they need to stay on. Don’t care, people don’t pay. They gotta stay on. And I believe that’s also happening.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nWhen she says she believes that’s happening, I just want to clarify that she means in her county. So that’s obviously different wherever you live in the United States.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThe other really big thing Jen has been working on setting up is a fund. She raised $11 million very quickly to distribute to people who had lost employment and were at risk of becoming homeless.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, it seems like… I mean, that’s a success. They raised a lot of money in a short amount of time. Is that enough?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah. I mean, I thought that sounded like a lot too, but it actually it wasn’t nearly enough.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“Within three hours, we had 1,400 applications. They were coming in at two applications every minute. They crashed our server and within three days there were more than $11 million worth of qualifying applications.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Yeah. You wrote in a tweet, ‘I feel scared in a way that’s hard to describe.’”', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“Gosh, it’s true. It’s true, sister. And I’m not a chicken. I walk into the middle of the suffrage for years, and the scale is overwhelming. People already – already – have no money left. Nothing.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nJen estimates that they need about 100 million dollars, and that’s again just in Santa Clara County, to keep people housed during this time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd this is on top of the stimulus and unemployment checks. And that’s still not going to be enough.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, I mean, for one, those checks still haven’t gotten to people for the most part. I think the first round of them is supposed to go out this week. But it sounds like it could be a while before everyone has their check. And then there are some people who won’t be eligible for those benefits. Undocumented people, for example.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so, have they been able to distribute the first $11 million that they gathered?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nJen said some of it had started going out, but not all of it. I mean, it’s a lot of work to process all of those applications and get all those checks out. And one of the problems they’re running up against right now is that their volunteer support has dried up. And that’s, you know, that’s not just in their organization that’s happening in every organization.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“So, if you think about most communities have a Meals on Wheels program and what that is, is homebound people, vulnerable people, people can’t leave their home, there’s meals that are prepared and delivered to them every day. Super cool, right? That is a 95% volunteer-run situation. So, when all volunteers disappear all at once… Right?”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI think people are probably having trouble knowing, like how they should balance social distancing and volunteering.', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“You know, that’s a good question. So, I will say that I think that’s a personal choice. But what I will tell you is people that are already working on the front lines are, in addition to that work, now delivering meals. Because here’s the thing, it also has to be done. And COVID is asking us to do all of the things we were doing before and a thousand more things, with less. And if you are able to be part of a solution, you need to get on being part of that solution. And if that means money, or if that means sewing a mask, or if that means stay at home and not, like, complaining, you know? It means all of those things because people who are the lowest-paid workers in this nation, who are largely people of color, are out on the goddamn front lines.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThe last thing I wanted to ask Jen about in the 30 minutes I stole from her was… I don’t know if you’ve been seeing these pictures of homeless people being moved into parking lots and stadiums?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, there was a picture from Las Vegas where they had… a grid was painted out to mark how far they should be camping like away from each other. Otherwise, it was just like an open parking lot. There was no coverage. There is no real shelter. It just was designated spaces on the ground.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYes. Yeah. Which they did because a resident in a 500-bed shelter had tested positive COVID and so they needed to get everyone out of that space to prevent the virus from spreading. So they moved people into this open-air parking lot. I think they’ve since been moved back inside. But I just wondered what she thought of that or things like that.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“I guess I wonder from your perspective, when you see something like that or you kind of like, ‘yep, it’s a crazy time, people are coming up with crazy solutions’ or does that strike you as like ‘we should be able to do way better than that’?”', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“You know, I think now, look… (sigh) pre-COVID America has treated homelessness in every kind of reprehensible way. Right now, though, the people that are trying to do the things that you’re describing, I’m not criticizing them because this is hell. If that’s the best they can do, that must be the best they can do. We are not doing that. Right? But I am in no position to criticize other communities because, you know, we don’t have every homeless person in a stable place. We’re sheltering in encampments. That is totally wrong, you know what I mean? But we can’t… We have asked America to give us more places for homeless people for, you know, my whole career. Now they’re telling us all to do it in a week. It’s amazing.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Well, thank you so much for your time.”', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“Yeah, I gotta go. I gotta go, sister. But yeah, check in with me and whatever you feel like… (inaudible) …”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Yeah. And best of luck out there.”', 'Jen Loving:', '\\n“Hey, thanks so much.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOne of the things you said Jen was trying to do was securing hotel rooms for homeless people. Is that part of the governor’s program?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah. So, on April 3rd, Governor Newsom announced something that he called “Project Roomkey”. He said he had secured almost 7,000 hotel rooms for homeless people and that they were on their way to getting 15,000.', 'Gavin Newsom:', '\\n“It’s a county-state partnership with the county fundamentally driving the car and the state of California building the car. We put together the technical teams of expertise. We are working with the counties as they identify these sites to get the operating agreements up and running.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nSo, yeah, when he says that counties are driving the car, he means these emergency operation centers and people like Jen who are out there, you know, making calls to hotel owners to get them to agree to rent rooms to the state.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd he’s talking about 15,000 rooms across the entire state. And that, again, sounds like it’s a lot. But I know for a fact that that’s not enough.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nYeah, exactly, because there are at least 150,000 homeless people in California which is why in some places you have activists calling on mayors to do more. So, on April 3rd, actually the same day as that Newsom press conference, there was a protest in San Francisco. It was a car protest, which is one of the amazing new things that we have in this new pandemic era, where a bunch of people drove their cars to this convention center in San Francisco where the city was planning on housing homeless people sort of on the floor, on mats. And the people in cars sat outside of this convention center honking in protest. They thought that people shouldn’t be sheltered together in this big open area, but instead put into hotel rooms. And they were urging the mayor to use her power to get hotel rooms for people.', 'News Report:', '\\n“A caravan of cars circled San Francisco’s Moscone Center while Mayor London Breed and city officials held a virtual press conference inside. The message still loud and clear at this socially distant protest.” (cars honking)', 'News Report:', '\\n“Police have blocked off Howard in front of Moscone…”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI talked to this sociologist named Chris Herring, who was part of that protest movement to get more hotel rooms and he says the mayor, London Breed, has the authority to commandeer hotel rooms in an emergency.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo, they have the power to do it. Why aren’t they doing it?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI mean, it’s a power that they don’t use very often. They say that it’s too expensive to put every single homeless person in a hotel. They also say that it’s much more complicated than you might think to move people into hotels. Like you have to have all this supportive staff who will provide food and services and clean the rooms. You can’t just like move people in, and that’s it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, totally.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nBut after that protests, the city did decide not to use the convention center as a mass shelter. And Mayor Breed said she’s negotiating to bring 7,000 more hotel rooms into use specifically for homeless people in San Francisco.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so, in terms of the hotel rooms that do exist, either in San Francisco or more generally across the state, who is getting into those?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nSo not nearly all of those hotels have been filled yet. It’s hard to get numbers on this, but some sources are saying that something close to 2,000 rooms across the state have been filled. I think most of the focus so far has been on shelters. So, if there’s a shelter where there’s a positive case, they’re putting people from that shelter who they think may have been exposed into hotels. Part of the criticism right now from advocates is that it’s sort of a reactive approach instead of a proactive one, meaning that instead of just immediately putting all homeless people into hotels, they’re waiting for cases to break out in shelters. And it’s also very much a referral-based system. So, if you think you have COVID, you still have to be referred to a hotel room by an approved medical or outreach worker. It’s sort of it’s almost like getting a prescription for a hotel room.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nLast Friday, the 10th of April, Mayor Breed announced that there had been a major outbreak of coronavirus in a shelter in San Francisco. The last numbers I saw were that 92 residents and 10 workers had tested positive. But those numbers will probably keep going up. In any case, according to The New York Times, it’s the biggest outbreak in a shelter so far in the US.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo right now, some of the people in shelters are going into hotels, but only if they’ve been exposed to the virus. But that doesn’t account for all the people in the encampments. What are they doing?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI was wondering about this. Like how much outreach is happening in encampments? Are people checking on folks outside or testing folks outside? I haven’t been going into the field much lately for the same reasons that we’re all staying home. But I decided I wanted to try and talk to a few people in an encampment. So I put on gloves and a mask and I went out to a camp in Berkeley where I’ve spent a good bit of time.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Hi, oh hey Shauna.”', '“Shauna: Hey, I know you. This is Katie. Come on in. How you’ve been?”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“I’ve been okay. How are you?”', 'Shauna:', '\\n“Alive!”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“So that’s Shauna sitting outside of her tent with her friend Jade. Shauna lives in encampment with about 60 other people, mostly in tents. And they said that a nurse practitioner and a social worker had just been out to the camp.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“And when were they here?”', 'Jade:', '\\n“Just probably 20, maybe 20, 30 minutes ago.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“And were they just kind of checking to see if anybody had been sick or anything?”', 'Shauna:', '\\n“Yeah, they’ve been coming out a couple times a week. Come check up on everyone out here.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nShauna said the one guy from the encampment had shown symptoms of COVID-19 and one of the outreach workers made sure he got tested and into a hotel. But it seemed like that was the only person so far that had gone to a hotel out there.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Do you guys feel like you’re doing any extra like hand-washing or…”', 'Jade:', '\\n“I’ve done hand-washing.”', 'Shauna:', '\\n“A bit more yeah. Been using the hand sanitize more or at least trying to keep the hands a little bit clean.”', 'Jade:', '\\n“I’ve been washing up in a bucket. Like, I don’t care. I gotta stay up on my hygiene somehow.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd how nervous is everyone there seemed to be about all this?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nI was wondering that. I asked that too.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Do you feel like you’re stressed out about the virus?”', 'Shauna:', '\\n“So much about the virus, just life in general.”', 'Jade:', '\\n“There’s other things to be stressing about.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“What do you feel like is the main thing you’re stressed about right now?”', 'Jade:', '\\n“Being poor and not being mentally able to work all the time and being like stable? I relapsed. I was a year and a half clean and I relapsed, so…”', 'Shauna:', '\\n“Don’t feel bad, I relapsed after 14 years.”', 'Jade:', '\\n“So I feel like a failure right now. And then all this other stuff’s going on, so it’s just like it’s hard to focus on that when I relapsed.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThis camp actually has, sort of relative to other camps, a good bit of outreach. There’s a couple clinics who send workers there and they have this one extremely dedicated activist named Andrea Hensen, who’s out there almost every day. Andrea’s been raising money through a GoFundMe and handing out things like hand sanitizer and facemasks.', 'Andrea Hensen:', '\\n“What are they, balaclavas?”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\n“Balaclavas?”', 'Andrea Hensen:', '\\n“Yeah, I call them baklavas…” (laughs)', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nA lot of the ways that homeless people make money are not possible right now. People used to collect cans to sell at recycling centers and those centers are mostly closed. Panhandling is more difficult right now. So lately, Andrea has had to bring food to the encampment.', 'Andrea Hensen:', '\\n“You know, I never had to provide food before. And I just handed out… I mean, we prepped 300 bags of groceries. I’m not a food distribution person, but I had to be because people tell me they’re hungry.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nShe also recently rented a Bobcat to try to get all the trash out of the encampment. And she’s been paying some of the people around there to help. Again, just all through a GoFundMe.', 'Andrea Hensen:', '\\n“We have to get this trash picked up because in order to mitigate this health crisis in the camp, you know, I’m buying new tents for people, but we’re putting them in filthy places. Where installing porta potties in filthy places.”', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nSo a lot of dedicated people out there working really, really hard right now. But, you know, like Jen said, there are thousands of homeless people in California. And now, you know, everyone wants this all to be solved like yesterday. So, it’s tough.', 'Andrea Hensen:', '\\n“If you wanna do any work and get it done, whenever you’re ready, then I’ll pay you. I have the garbage bags… We’ll clean all the trash on the corner.

Katie Mingle will be back to talk about that after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFrom her apartment in Oakland, here again, is Katie Mingle.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nSan Francisco and other cities are looking to repurpose vacant hotels to shelter unhoused people during this coronavirus outbreak, but this isn’t the first time hotels have been used as crucial infrastructure in times of crisis. I wanted to find out more about the history of people repurposing hotels this way, so I called up Kenneth Morrison.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nHello, my name is Kenneth Morrison and I’m a professor of modern European history and I’m based in De Montfort University in Leicester in the United Kingdom.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd so why is it that hotels, in particular, are deployed in this kind of way? Like, what is it about a hotel that makes it very useful in a moment like this?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nI mean, hotels in many respects are perfect for being repurposed in the way that they are right now. So if you think about the microstructure of a hotel, you have large kitchens, you know, lots of refrigeration. You have supply chains. So basically, the hotel can continue to function. It might not be serving the same food or it might not be serving the same drinks or whatever, but it can continue to function. It works. And if you think about the internal structure of a hotel, most hotels have got a quite large atrium. So, you know, atriums can be used as places where medical personnel perhaps are based or seeing people as they come in. And all of the rooms function as these kind of isolation units, because when people go and stay in hotels, you know, perhaps they just got married or they’re, you know, couples going away for a weekend without the children or whatever. There is, you know, a certain amount of privacy required. So, of course, that means that every room has to be kind of insulated and isolated.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nAnd in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, it’s perfect because you have these huge corridors where food can be left outside the door and the person can be left within this kind of isolated unit, which is the room. And the room, of course, always has ensuite facilities so they can shower in the room, they can wash, they can sleep, they can watch television, they have access to the Internet. So being used as a quarantine center, hotels do that particularly effectively. And if you think of other buildings that might be used as quarantine centers, sports halls, for example, those sports halls have to be internally reconstructed in order to become quarantine centers or field hospitals. Actually, you have to do a lot less of that in a hotel. So hotel functions really well. It can be repurposed very, very quickly.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nCan you talk a little bit about how hotels were repurposed during the recent European refugee crisis?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nYes, in the case of the migrant/refugee crisis in 2015/2016, of course, you had millions of people coming to the European continent and sometimes they had to be held in camps, but other times they would be held in hotels. So they would be kept in hotels. There are various different examples of this. The biggest example of this is what happened in Germany, because, of course, the vast majority of those migrants that were seeking to leave places like Libya and Syria in 2015/2016 were heading for Germany.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nWhen Angela Merkel essentially said that refugees/migrants are welcome. She was then faced with the problem of, well, what do we do with these sheer number of people and we have to hold them somewhere. And the German government actually entered into a number of contracts, agreements with large hotel groups so that the refugees would be housed there. And they were housed there for a short time until they could be genuinely kind of incorporated into society. They could get jobs. They could then perhaps then look for apartments of their own and so forth. But the hotel in that context played a really important role in managing that immediate crisis. And that given the sheer numbers of people that arrived in Germany at that time has actually been a relative success story. But it wouldn’t have been possible without the hotels and the rule that the hotel played and that huge movement of people.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd were the hotels still kind of like hotels or were they so were they more like apartments where there wasn’t necessarily a counter where you check-in…? How was it different when the refugees were housed in these places?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nSo basically, there were two types of hotels. There were the ones that were completely taken over, essentially government contract. German government paid Grand City hotels for the use of these 22 hotels in Berlin, for example. And if what it meant was that the German government were giving to the hotel industry the finance for that so that they could continue to operate. So the hotel, for them, it guaranteed more or less 100 percent occupancy rates, but they weren’t really functioning as hotels at that time. They weren’t, you know, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And many of the staff that worked there continued to work there. They were cleaning. They were making food for the refugees and so forth. But it wasn’t functioning as a normal hotel.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nHowever, there were other hotels that we’re actually allowing refugees to work there and training them and giving them skills that would make it possible for them to enter into work within German society. This happened in Germany, in Austria and Belgium. The refugees were given an opportunity to train as barman, you know, to train as waiters, doing silver service and so forth. So they needed to train and do something that would allow them to make a living very, very quickly. And again, the hotel plays this very important role.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd did you hear stories about kind of what these places were like? It strikes me as potentially hard to kind of suddenly turn a hotel into this very different function. Did you hear stories of just like what it was like? Like how did they feed people…? How did it work?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nThe difficulty with redeploying a hotel like that, and this was much less the case in Germany, but in other places, locals were very suspicious of a large hotel being taken over and used as a place to host refugees. So in Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, for example, you had a number of hotels that were redeployed in this way and lots of luxury hotels were built in Ireland prior to the economic crash of 2008. And of course, after 2008, there wasn’t a market. There simply wasn’t a market for them. So the hoteliers had to find a way to use the space that they had, so many of these hotels were used as places to house refugees.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nSometimes there was a lot of suspicion coming from local populations who weren’t happy about this. They felt that putting refugees in a hotel was not an effective way to bring them into the society. You were basically isolating them from society and it created this kind of ‘us and them’ feeling. But these were only ever intended to be temporary spaces – three months, six months. It was part of a kind of wider redistribution program where the refugees wouldn’t stay in the hotel for too long. They would be moved on quite quickly. But within the hotels themselves – no, they weren’t functioning as ordinary hotels. There was catering there because that was part of the agreement with the governments, that there would be catering for the new guests. But it wouldn’t have been anything like the kind of service that a normal hotel would provide in normal times.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nRight. And then did some of those hotels go back to being sort of normal tourist hotels after?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nThey did because, of course, once the economic situation began to improve and in Europe after 2008, you had the Euro crisis. And by 2014, you have the beginning of this refugee crisis. But really by 2016, the European economies are a bit more stable and many of these hotels go back to being exactly what they were intended to be.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd is there anything about that process of converting back that was interesting? Like they probably have to kind of clean in and maybe refurbish some of the rooms? I don’t know. Is there a process?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nYes, but it is actually extremely business-like. And this is what’s so interesting about the transitions that these buildings go through. Yes, of course, there will have been the need to redecorate probably. That was part of the contract with the German government. For example, there was a slice of money in there for that redecoration to take place at the end because they knew that obviously it wouldn’t be perhaps kept in the same ways as it would have been when functioning as a normal hotel. But they just moved back to being the spaces that they were and used for the purpose that they were intended for. These are business arrangements in essence, what we’ve seen in the case of the refugee crisis in Europe. The building is needed for a specific period of time. Various hotels are offered. The German government sign or German-Dutch-Belgian government sign an agreement to rent a hotel for that purpose. And then there’s, as I mentioned, the slice of money that’s given to redecorate or convert the hotel afterwards back to being a normal hotel.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nThere are some activists here in the Bay Area like San Francisco, Oakland. The governor here in California has already announced a plan to bring about 15,000 hotel rooms to being used to house homeless people here. We have a lot of homeless people in California, but there are activists that are calling on, like the mayor of San Francisco, for example, to kind of go a step further and instead of carefully negotiating these deals with hotels to actually commandeer them. And that’s not a step that she is going to take, it doesn’t seem, but have you heard of things like that happening where people use kind of like an executive privilege to take over hotels when they need to?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nYes. And they can be commandeered in times of crisis. Buildings like hotels can often be strategic assets because they often occupy strategic heights. They can be quite tall buildings, particularly in an urban conflict, control of the strategic heights is extremely important. So, you know, sometimes hotels can be commandeered for that purpose. And what we’re facing now with the COVID-19 crisis is something really unique and in the context of the United States, for example, to think that any politician could tell business or a hotel owner, that they simply have to take the hotel and commandeered it for that purpose is hugely controversial. We’ve never been, I think, in a situation in Europe or the United States where that has been necessary. Certainly not in living memory. It was necessary during the Second World War where lots of hotels were commandeered either as field hospitals or bases for various agencies, government agencies who want to move out. London during the Blitz, for example, they had to take over these buildings and turn them into something else for a temporary period until the war was over. So it’s not without precedent but normally happens under the emergency powers that are enacted in the context of conflict.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nMaybe you could talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in terms of the COVID-19 crisis, like what kind of role you’re seeing hotels start to take.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nAbsolutely. In New York, you had a couple of really nice hotels – the St. Regis, the Plaza, Eurotel. They become temporary field hospitals, but for non-critical patients. So it’s to basically take the pressure off the hospitals themselves. And then, of course, the Four Seasons in Manhattan, which, you know, in any ordinary time would be a rather expensive place to live, is now being opened up to health care workers. Hotels now are being used in a number of ways. They’re being used primarily as quarantine centers because, of course, so many people have had to leave the countries they may be working in or living temporarily and or on holiday. And of course, they then have to be put into quarantine for a 14 day period so we’ve seen hotels open them. Some are offering, in fact, quarantine packages where for 14 days you can go and live in a rather nice four or five-star hotel and have 14 days of quarantine there. Others are being forcibly quarantined by governments. So when they arrive back on home soil, you then have to spend 14 days in self-isolation.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nIs there something you get in these quarantine packages that is different, like all your food brought to your room…?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nYes. I mean, the packages are providing the same service as a hotel normally would. Although, some people I’ve spoken to who have been in various hotels dotted around the world, have complained that the level of service is not quite what they would have expected. So obviously the food on offer is not what it would be under normal times. So you’re stuck in your room. It’s a beautiful room maybe with a nice view, but you can’t go anywhere. You have food brought to your door. But as I said, it won’t be of the same quality that one would have expected in such a hotel. But that’s a relatively nice way of being quarantined. In some cases, for example, I spoke recently to a student from Bosnia who had been working in Germany as a researcher and had to return home to the Bosnia-Herzegovina. And when they returned home, they were taken to this one hotel in a place called Tuzla in Bosnia. And they were to stay there for 14. They were basically forcibly held there for 14 days. And this has been happening all over Europe. Those that return, they simply have to submit and be kept in isolation.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd what about homelessness specifically? How are you seeing hotels being used?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nYes. In the case of the UK, the Crowne Plaza, I think the Holiday Inn and therefore the Holiday Inn Express, have come to an agreement with the UK government and the mayor London. They’ve basically handed over hundreds of rooms. I don’t know what the financial agreement was there, but those rooms will be available for the homeless of London. And I have to say that homelessness was becoming something of a crisis in London and it was very noticeable over the last couple of years in particular so there was a real effort required for the UK government to try and get homeless people off the streets. And of course, they were hugely vulnerable in the situations that they were in. But there was a big kind of effort to do that. And hotels were generally used as places to house the homeless?', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd do you know, in those cases, were they moving homeless folks into hotels that were already showing symptoms or was it just a proactive ‘let’s get everybody inside so that nobody is as vulnerable to this as they would be outside’?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nWell, some European countries have been testing far more than the UK. In the UK, the numbers have been quite low. So there was no time, and no facilities actually, to test people who perhaps were demonstrating any kind of symptoms, even if minor symptoms or kind of early symptoms. It was just that they had to be taken off the streets and given somewhere to live, given a roof over their heads for a short period so that they one, wouldn’t spread the disease and two, might not be exposed to those with it. And I’d be really interested to see what these hotels look like inside at the moment and what kind of services there are and to what extent those people are being looked after. And that I do not know, because it’s impossible, of course, to enter into any of these buildings. It’s impossible for me to travel, really. I can’t even go to my university, let alone to one of these hotels for the purposes of research.', 'Katie Mingle:', '\\nAnd what about just sort of like the scale overall around the world? Do you feel like the number of hotels that have transformed into kind of responding to this crisis in some way would be more than we’ve maybe seen since one of the world wars?', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nI think we’ve never seen anything like this since the Second World War. You’ve had individual crises in individual countries or even regional conflicts, but you’ve never seen anything like this because what’s happened here is that the hotel industry has been seriously damaged by this. It will take a long, long time for hotels to recover, for tourism to recover from this. So if you even think optimistically that we might get back to some kind of normality in terms of tourism by 2021, so there will be a tourist season in 2021, you’re looking at at least a year’s income really lost by hotels. So of course, they have to adapt and they have to become something else and they have to offer their services because otherwise, they may simply go out of business. And I think that perhaps those hotel chains that have offered their services at this particular time might be more favorably looked upon than those that didn’t. If they need to be bailed out in the future, because, of course, the COVID-19 crisis may end in intensity, the kind of intensity that we’re experiencing at the moment.', 'Kenneth Morrison:', '\\nBut it will take a long time for life to go back to normal, for people to feel that they want to travel again, for borders to open. For the time being, many hotels will simply not be able to return to business as usual and revert back to being places where, you know, you have weddings and parties and business meetings and holidays and so forth. That can’t happen. And in the countries that are really hit by bye COVID-19, those hotels have no other option really than to kind of redeploy and repurpose and become used as something else.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99% Invisible was produced this week by Katie Mingle and Abby Madan, with help from Emmett FitzGerald.

Every year around this time, these floating behemoths filled with tourists sail up the inside passage, stopping at little coastal port towns like Sitka and Ketchikan. One of the popular destinations along the route is Glacier Bay. It’s this spectacular bay full of glaciers, hence the name, and icebergs and sea otters and lots and lots of humpback whales. The National Park Service regulates how many cruise ships can come in and out of the bay and how close they can get to the whales. But still, the humpbacks that are there in the summer have to live alongside roaring boat engines.', '[HUMPBACK WHALES SINGING]', 'Michelle Fournet:', '\\nWhat we know is that animals change their behavior when the ocean gets noisy.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMichelle Fournet is an acoustic ecologist at Cornell. Every summer she travels to Glacier Bay to drop a hydrophone in the water, listen in on what the whales are saying and study how it’s being affected by ship noise. This year, Michelle was preparing for her annual trip to Alaska when the COVID-19 shutdowns were announced.', 'Michelle Fournet:', '\\nSo Friday the 13th was the last day that we were allowed to be in the lab at work before we had to start sheltering in place.

The trip to Alaska that I was meant to take to go and do work with these animals wasn’t going to happen.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe lab at Cornell would also need to close. And so all the scientists gathered together for a final in-person meeting to try to plan out how everyone was going to keep their research going from home.

And all of a sudden, my personal, sentimental brain turned off and my biologist’s brain turned back on and an immediate flurry to get hydrophones in, the water ensued.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn that moment, Michelle realized that although her research trip had been canceled, the coronavirus shut down had created an incredible opportunity.

But if you’re sitting at home having a cup of tea on your couch and there’s no music playing and it’s quiet and you’re talking to someone who’s beloved to you. The nature of the conversation can get really nuanced. So that’s one of the things that we’d like to find out with these humpbacks is when they’re not struggling to be heard. Does the complexity of what they say increase? Are they willing and able to have more nuanced acoustic interactions that perhaps they can’t have when it’s noisy?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut whatever happens, Michelle is just excited to dig into the data.', 'Michelle Fournet:', '\\nWe will finally get a baseline for what the ocean sounds like in the absence of human activity.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn general, the coronavirus shutdowns have been terrible for academic research.

There are tons of pictures of these mountains on Instagram and TikTok videos of people zooming in on the horizon.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo why was this such a big deal?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nWell, because many people were seeing these mountains for the very first time.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nPeople who had lived in Jalandhar all their lives had suddenly woken up to this vista of snow-capped mountains across the horizon, a view that they said that they had never seen before.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Raghu Karnad. And he wrote about this phenomenon for The New Yorker. And he says that because of air pollution, the mountains have been completely obscured. Locals think the last time these mountains had been visible was about 30 years ago. But because of the shutdown and the lack of pollution from cars and industry, the skies were clear in a way that had seemed impossible before.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nThat was the kind of scope of the transformation that had made the unimaginable real.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so was this phenomenon unique to Jalandhar?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI think it’s a particularly dramatic and poetic example, but really in cities all across India, the sky is blue and you can see the stars at night. The air feels clean in a way that it just hasn’t in a really long time. And, you know, air pollution is a huge problem in India. Of the 20 cities in the world with the worst air pollution, 14 of them are Indian cities.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nYou really can’t exaggerate it. India is still a global hotspot for air pollution. And that’s happened. We’ve sort of taken that place from China over the last 20 years.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd one of the cities with the worst air quality is the capital city, Delhi. Karnad has lived there for a lot of his adult life and he told me that a part of his morning routine would be to check a website that maps the air quality index throughout the city. And, just for context, when AQI is over 300, it’s considered hazardous to your health. But Karnad said he would often see readings of 999.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nAnd the reason it was that figure – 999 – was not because that was the correct reading. It’s because that’s where the monitor is maxed out. Even if you’re right, it feels like language is failing you. You kind of describe it yourself like, “Oh god, this is a nightmare? This is a sci-fi movie. This is like the apocalypse.” And none of that helps you comprehend the fact that there’s smog visible inside your home.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s incredible. I mean, not seeing a mountain is one thing, but this is just a gigantic public health tragedy.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nTotally. I mean, I think air pollution is really one of the most underappreciated public health problems that we have. The WHO says that 4.6 million people die each year from causes related to air pollution, and that’s happening all over the world. But it really is most dire in India.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nThe World Health Organization had an estimate from 2016 that 100,000 Indian children below the age of five had died that year from exposure to a particular kind of particulates in air pollution. And the figures make it quite abundantly clear that Indians are dying and being made sick in really vast numbers, numbers that are almost sort of too large to process.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd, for years it’s felt like such a large problem that it’s almost unsolvable.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nAnd that’s what makes this moment so extraordinary, which is that we’ve reached this solution. We fixed this problem without intending to.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is incredible. I mean, it really does create this strange silver lining to an international tragedy.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. And, I think people are reluctant to use language like that because it’s obviously such a terrible situation. But there’s one group of people for whom the shutdown really has been a gift, and that’s air pollution researchers. Researchers like Sarath Guttikunda.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nI’m Sarath Guttikunda. I’m the director and the founder of Urban Emissions. Urban Emissions is an independent research group and we do research on air pollution.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd the scientists at Urban Emissions are always looking to understand the baseline air quality, like what would a clean air scenario even look like? And usually, they use holidays when people are stuck inside or rainy days to do this. But those don’t last very long.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nWhen it rains, it’s clean for one day and then maybe the next day that buildup starts happening. But what we’re seeing here is sustained. For a sustained period of time, we’re seeing lower numbers.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo Guttikinda says that the shutdown feels like the entire country is basically running a giant experiment for him.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nThe phrase that I’ve been using is “forced experiment.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nA forced experiment that shows you what happens if you turn many of the major sources of pollution down basically to zero. And when you do that, turns out the air is pretty clean, which might seem obvious but the air pollution problem has been so intractable in India. And here is this concrete example showing that it’s possible to clean up the air.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nSo here we have an example of a sustained period where we’re seeing we can maintain this level of emissions and this is the kind of quality we’re going to experience.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd having this extended period of clean air is also allowing them to do more fine-tuned research experiments. Some of those are really chemistry–looking at particular pollutants like ozone, for example, and sort of tracking it. But they’re also trying to do a forensic accounting of where all this air pollution is coming from because there’s actually a lot of confusion about this in India. And a big question people have is like, is the pollution generated inside the city by things like cars and trash burning and dirty cookstoves? Or is it floating in from outside sources, from things like power plants and heavy industry outside the city or farmers in the countryside who burn their fields before they replant? All those sources are contributing to the problem but the uncertainty about who to blame has allowed cities to basically throw up their hands and say, this isn’t a problem that we can solve.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So the uncertainty allows the people in power to just do essentially just pass the buck and not deal with it at all.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, exactly. And so that’s been one of the goals of Guttikunda’s research. Because certain sources of pollution have been completely turned off while others have carried on, Guttikunda is able to isolate the different sources of emissions and calculate how much of the pollution that a city is experiencing is generated inside of the city itself. And it turns out it’s a lot.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nWe can easily see a large chunk of it is actually coming from the local sources. In a city like Delhi, maybe we find that easily 70% of the pollution is actually locally generated.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo just so I understand, normally a city like Delhi would sort of blame the pollution on outside forces saying this is coming from power plants outside the city or this is coming from agricultural burning. And the reality is, Delhi is responsible for a lot of Delhi’s pollution problem.', 'Sarath Guttikunda:', '\\nAbsolutely.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nA lot of this research is just confirming what the scientists that Urban Emissions had really been seeing in their models before, but Raghu Karnad says that because that analysis was based on more hypothetical modeling, policymakers were finding it much easier to reject and ignore.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nNow they have data that confirms exactly what their models have been demonstrating, which is that cities can do much more to fix their own problem and to clean up their own house.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd the biggest thing that a city like Delhi could do to clean up its own house is really to take on traffic.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. Which can be a pretty hard problem to solve unless you’re willing to take pretty drastic measures and change the nature of a city.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. And, you know, Delhi has tried to do something about this before. They tried one of those odds and evens policies where only people with an odd last digit on their license plate could drive on some days and then only people with an even last digit could drive on the others. But it really wasn’t very well received.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nThere was so much criticism for this policy that I don’t think that it was carried out for long enough for us to really evaluate whether it was making a difference. You know, so. So that’s why the specificity and the credibility of this data is so important. You really need to be able to back up your policy plans. And the policy plans need to be very comprehensive and they need to be very convincing because a lot of people may be put out of work or are severely inconvenienced by the kind of changes that we need to see.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut cities have cleaned up their air before. It’s possible. Beijing, for example, used to have the worst air quality in the world. But then that became something of an embarrassment when they were chosen to host the Olympics in 2008.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. You can’t have athletes huffing and puffing the most toxic air in the world for days and days on end.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight. And so they put in all these really intense restrictions to clean up the air in time for the games.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nThe Olympics took place. And when they were done, all those restrictions were lifted. And very quickly, the air went back to being as bad as it had been before. But now people were unhappy about it. What had seemed impossible to ask for had proven to be possible to deliver, which was blue skies and clean air and to not live in the most polluted city in the world, which was what Beijing was. So now there was a public outcry.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd the city responded to that public outcry. Beijing tightened emission standards on trucks. They subsidized electric cars. They regulated traffic in particularly congested areas and built the giant bike share program. They offer people cleaner fuels to burn in their homes.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nTwelve years later, Beijing is nowhere on the list of the worst polluted cities in the world. I don’t even believe that it’s in the top 100. So the example of the Beijing Olympics doesn’t just demonstrate that it is possible to improve the air, but it also demonstrates that people, once they’ve experienced that it’s doable, will want that and can be moved to demand that.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nDo you have hope that something similar could happen in India?', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nAs with a lot of things right now, hope is non-negotiable. But it’s never felt more possible that Indian cities could be livable, sane, and even healthy. And so we’ve just got to hope that everyone can be brought around to realizing the necessity of this collective action just the way everyone has been brought around to realizing that with coronavirus.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nDo you think it’s interesting that we’ve seen people make the decision that, COVID-19 is a threat to public health, that it’s so severe that we need to take these extremely severe actions? What is it about that’s different than air pollution? Like if the numbers show that air pollution is also a public health crisis, what about a virus is easier to sort of wrap your head around as a public health problem than air pollution?', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nI think I think that’s a fascinating question. And I think that it’s something well worth investigating what it was that made us capable of this really inspiring, robust collective sacrifice that made us capable of this determination to transform our lives and escape this crisis just with the coronavirus, when in fact our cities have been in a state of crisis for a long time. They have been practically unlivable and frankly unbearable for a long time and it never moved us to anything like this kind of collective effort.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs a society, we just process different types of risks so differently. If we were just looking at the raw numbers of deaths, we would never get into a car again.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight. And, just to be clear, the point I don’t think is that we’re overreacting to COVID-19, it’s that we’re under-reacting to all these other public health threats, in part, I would argue because many of them have disproportionate impacts on poor people and people of color, especially air pollution. If you have money and you live in a city like Delhi, you can take an Uber from your air-conditioned apartment to your air-conditioned office job. But there are millions of people who can’t afford to do that, people who ride their bike or walk to get around, shop in open-air markets, those people are just breathing the air all the time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s also like an environmental justice issue.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. It’s a huge environmental justice issue. And for my mind, just like the best example of under-appreciated public health threat.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. Although I think that probably climate change is also another pretty good example of that, too.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nTotally. Totally. I’ve been thinking about climate change a lot lately. I mean, I’m always thinking about climate change, but particularly now in part because, like coronavirus, it’s a problem that just like demands collective global action. And Raghu Karnad said that he’s been thinking about climate change a lot too, these days.', 'Raghu Karnad:', '\\nYeah, absolutely. And, you know, I do want to make India sound special, but when it comes to climate change, we are in the frontline because there are really parts of the country in the interior where the increased heat is making life unlivable. If there’s any country that should be confronting climate change as an emergency that we take on, on a war footing – as an emergency that makes anything possible and any measures acceptable – then this is that country. And just like the other crises, as you mentioned, it’s just never seemed justified. It’s never seemed justified to do something like this, not even for climate change.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat is so remarkable.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I guess like with climate change and with air pollution and with all of this, I think this story in India really raises for me just kind of this question of like, what are we going back to when we come out of all this? And like, are we… We don’t want to talk about silver linings when so much bad is happening. But are there things we can learn from the ways in which the world has been changed by this moment, even in the weird ways in which it’s been changed for the better?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. I don’t think it diminishes the moment to treat the moment as having lessons for us in the future. I mean, I think that it would be a double tragedy if we went through this and learned nothing. So let’s just take advantage of what we’ve learned about pandemics, about air pollution, about everything, and try to make the world better.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I think it’s all we can do.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo we’re now moving on to the next natural experiment, which is presented by our producer, Joe Rosenberg. Hey, Joe.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nHey there.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it’s time for your report. What kind of scientific study is on the precipice of advancement as an unexpected result of COVID-19?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI’m so glad you asked because, for the past few days, I had been delving into the very latest research being done at the very cutting edge of an exciting, highly specialized scientific field: Boredom Studies.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBoredom studies. I mean, I guess because everything’s a thing, but I didn’t know that was a thing.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt is a thing. Although even the boredom study experts themselves seem to be surprised that it is a thing and that they study it.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nNo one, I think, as a little kid ever says, like, “You know what, I really want to do what I grow up? I want to study boredom.” So it certainly… it was totally unplanned.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThis is Erin Westgate. She’s an assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Florida. And one of her specialties is boredom. And Erin says one good reason to study boredom is that, for starters, most people don’t have the first clue about how boredom works, including apparently their own.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nOne of the fun things of being a boredom researcher is like when I meet someone, the conversation usually goes like this: “Hi, I’m Erin.” “What do you study?” “I study boredom.” And they go, “Oh, I never get bored.” And that always takes me aback because I want to be like, “Yes, you do.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s so funny. I was thinking the exact same thing. I never get bored.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOh, you never get bored? Well, you see, this is where Erin would prove you wrong because this is her specialty. She gets this kind of “evil genius” thrill out of bringing unsuspecting people into the lab and figuring out ways to bore them to death.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nPeople hate my studies. They’re so bad. We do these debriefings at the end. We say, “How was it?” And they just look at me and they’re like, “That was the most boring thing I’ve ever done.” And inside, I’m like, “Yes. Yes. I’m so glad.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what is the most boring thing she has them do? Paradoxically, I’m pretty interested in how boring she can make someone’s life.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And that’s the thing, you say you don’t get bored. But the truth is, you have been presented with boring tasks in life that you have no choice but to concentrate on. So maybe just like a video of a sidewalk, like literally one foot above the sidewalk pointed down. And because you don’t know it’s a boredom study, you expect something to happen, but nothing happens. Or it will be something like you’re going to play this air traffic control game where you get to direct all this traffic to make sure all the planes land safely and this is how it works. And people are like, “Oh. Okay, a game!” But then they make it really easy — like they make it stultifyingly easy. And in fact, Erin is so good at inducing boredom that her whole career started when she accidentally bored some people while studying something slightly different.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo what was that study and how did it later focus on boredom?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo a little more than five years ago, Erin was running this study where they were trying to find out how much people enjoy being left alone with their own thoughts. And so what they did is they gathered a bunch of participants in a lab and first expose them to a quick electric shock.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nIt’s this nasty little electrode you put around your ankle so I always say it kind of felt like a cat, like biting your ankle. You know, like if a cat dives out and attacks you.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd not surprisingly, most participants said they did not like being shocked. But then she says they told the same participants to just sit in this room. No magazines, no fun, and just enjoy being alone with their thoughts for a little while.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nOh, and by the way, that little button that electrodes are still hooked up if you want… I don’t know why you’d want to… but if you want, you could press the button and it will still deliver an electric shock. And then we simply left them in the room by themselves for, it was actually 15 minutes and waited to see what they would do.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd apparently, one-quarter of the women and I’m sad to report two-thirds of the men chose to shock themselves. And most people shot themselves multiple times.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that is incredible.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nThere is one man, it was a man who shocked himself… oh I forget now… it was well over a hundred times.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nCan I just say, though, that that guy then, he was definitely not bored?', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nOh, no, he was having the time of his life. He was like, this is exactly what I always needed.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nBut apparently a lot of the participants who shocked themselves were not like that guy. When asked why they did it, they were just like, “I got bored. And it was better than nothing.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s like if you’re in a waiting room and there’s a 10-year-old magazine and you’re actually reading it. You’d never read otherwise but in a really boring setting, you just go for it.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nRight. And then like you can like a can devolve from there. When you’re done with the magazine, now you have like the candy wrapper nutritional information. And then below that is the electrode strapped to your ankle that feels like a cat biting you.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou might as well.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWhich I find kind of sad. But Erin, evil genius that she is, she just thought, “Fascinating!”', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nIt was this magnificent, wonderful puzzle. And I got totally hooked and I sort of switched gears and really started investigating what boredom is, why we experience it, and what happens when we do.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo let’s just start with that first question. So what is boredom? Because one of the things that makes this hard for me to sort of picture what boredom studies are about is what is the scientific basis of boredom? Is there actually a distinct emotion that you can pin down and measure, or is it just a word that actually means a variety of things?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWell, this is actually where things get really interesting because that is something we’re still trying to figure out in some ways. Erin says that in the last two decades there has been a growing consensus that boredom is in fact, a real emotion. And just like other emotions, it’s not intrinsically good or bad. Much like pain, it’s a signal telling you something is amiss with your situation that needs to be changed somehow. But when it comes to the question of what exactly is amiss. In other words, when it comes to Erin’s second question, “Why do we get bored?”, that’s where the scientific consensus ends.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nWhen you get down to the nitty-gritty of what exactly is causing boredom, you’re going to start finding a lot of disagreements. So there are folks, for instance, who preferred to define boredom as just about attention.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThis is the attentional model. The idea being that you get bored when you’re stuck doing something that requires only a little attention. So the rest of your attentional capacity is desperately looking for something else to do, in which case you just kind of check out and the task loses all meaning.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nThere’s other folks that are like, “No, no, no, no, no, no. You have it completely backwards. It’s all about meaning.” If you have trouble paying attention to something when you’re bored, it’s because that thing wasn’t meaningful.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd this is the meaning-based model. And in the meaning-based model, for an experience to not be boring, it just needs to seem somehow worthwhile. So you could do a challenging puzzle that requires the right amount of attention. But if you don’t find it genuinely interesting, it’s still boring. Or conversely, you can do something repetitive and simple. But if you think it’s saving lives, you will get bored.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s really interesting. I mean, I think I kind of see how both models work. I mean, it makes me wonder if they’re entirely separate emotions or I don’t know. It just seems like it’s really hard to tell how you would know which one is true.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, exactly. And Erin works with a model that tries to incorporate both. But this is where your original question, “Is boredom just a word?”, actually comes back into play.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nSo, for instance, in French, the word for boredom really eludes more to what we would think of as its “meaning components.” In German, the word for boredom emphasizes the sense that time is slowing down.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWhich is a classic symptom of attentional boredom. And in Japanese, there are in fact two different words for boredom that loosely map onto these two different meanings.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so is this one of those cases where the word actually affects the meaning? They become sort of self-fulfilling prophecies, where if you’re French, you only get bored in a meaningful way. If you’re German, you get bored in the sort of attentional way.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nWe don’t know yet. And Erin points out that even within English, there’s this issue that the word boredom didn’t even really exist before 1600.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nAnd it’s not clear to me how much boredom is something that is a problem of modernity. I think there’s very, very limited data right now that speaks to this point at all.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo it strikes me that figuring this out isn’t just an intellectual exercise because our understanding of boredom must have some kind of public health implications, especially when you imagine how we respond to being bored, like as a culture. Like do we have a problem with boredom to make people do bad things?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThat’s a good question because we know there is a correlation at least between people reporting being bored and things like depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-harm, but also of education and social connections and exercise. So this is one reason why Erin’s third and final big question is, “What do we do once we’re bored?” And it turns out it’s also the question which COVID-19 and the quarantine might actually help us answer.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, I can see where this is heading. There’s a lot of people who are bored at home right now. But lay it out for me. What is she going to look at?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nOkay, so there’s this big mystery, right? How is boredom affecting us, including when we’re bored, do most of us start doing something healthy or something unhealthy? And unfortunately for Erin and other boredom researchers, the data on this is just all over the place.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nFor instance, there’s some work that finds that experimentally inducing boredom increases prosocial behavior. There’s other work that finds that experimentally inducing boredom increases antisocial behavior. So which is it?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nErin says that the thing getting in the way of good data and a clear answer on this is which activities people turn to when bored can be really hard to study in a lab setting. For the simple reason that when you confine people to a lab, you can’t actually give them that many options of things to do.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nSo you’re in the boring group, you’re not — you can shock yourself or not. You’re in the boring group, you’re not — you can eat a snack or not. And I don’t know how useful that’s going to be to us in understanding the effects of boredom in the real world where we often have many multiple options available to us. And that question always kind of hangs over you. Does it matter? Who cares if you find an effect in the lab if no one actually does it in the real world.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nSo obviously there’s this incentive to do studies outside of the lab, in the real world. But there was a problem with reality and it’s the opposite of the problem with the lab, which is people don’t get bored enough.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nYou know, for better or worse, people are not that bored all the time in everyday life. I think the best estimates suggest people are bored around 5% of the time, which isn’t really that bad. If you calculate it out, it’s about 30 minutes a day. But 30 minutes a day of boredom is probably not all in one chunk, it’s separated out across time.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd this is because most people don’t stay bored for very long. Thanks to the structure of their daily life, they go back to work or school. Almost always, very quickly something happens without them even having to think about it and they stop being bored.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So the upshot is that you can either get people really bored in a lab, but not see how they’d actually realistically behave. Or you could study how people realistically behave to boredom. But out in the real world, they’re actually rarely bored for very long. So it’s hard to catch them in the act, so to speak.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nExactly. And this is where the coronavirus outbreak comes in, because thanks to the quarantine, people outside the lab in the real world are at long last more bored more often than they’ve ever been before.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nAnd for better or worse, certainly for worse for the people experiencing it, but better for me and my graduate student and my other fellow boredom researchers around the world.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, go ahead. Be happy about it.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nYeah! We’re kind of thrilled. I have not been bored. Other people’s boredom has made very sure that I have not been bored these past few weeks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt’s just hours and hours of glorious boredom to study.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, yeah, it’s beautiful. And so one of Erin’s doctoral students named Yijun Lin proposed doing this study. And to be clear, this does not actually fit the formal definition of a natural experiment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So the boredom level isn’t the only variable that’s changed, some of the out-of-house activities that people might turn to when they’re bored are off the table.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, but on the plus side, it is potentially getting people bored in this kind of sustained way where they have to make up their own minds about what to do if they hope to be unbored. Erin’s team is really curious to see what activities people choose. And one way they’re doing that is they’re having participants fill out this kind of daily survey of how they’ve been feeling and what they’ve been up to in which they can choose from this checklist of possible activities.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nAnd other researchers keep asking like, “Oh, can you add this to the checklist? Can you add that to the checklist?” Because there’s so many questions like, are people baking sourdough bread out of boredom, are people buying games out of boredom, are people… There’s a whole set of questions. Are people hooking up and becoming lovers with their roommates out of boredom? Like what’s going on? What are people doing?', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nAnd so, they’re looking into all sorts of things. They’re looking into whether there is a discrepancy between how people think they react to boredom versus how they actually react to boredom. And also, is boredom followed by maladaptive behaviors, including breaking the quarantine. But also, they can record something that by definition is almost impossible to record in the lab, which is “novelty-seeking”, people trying things they’ve never tried before. I just recently asked her to send me a list of some of these novel activities that people are trying. And in some ways, it’s just very sweet. So like, “spray-painted a string of lights outside,” “tried a new hair color,” “tried making my own music,” “went under my house to look for a dead rat, used my cats to help search for the rat.” But also, “watched a church sermon with my family, something we don’t do very often,” “helped my little brother set up a kite to fly in the front yard,” “talked to a new person.” And then a few fun ones, “I’m about to smoke weed.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n(laughs) Okay.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nIt’s a Slim Jims for breakfast. That’s pretty grim. Yeah. Some of these you could classify as maladaptive behavior itself.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSelf-harm.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nI think we can joke about this like, “Oh, we’re baking bread. Oh, we’re doing this little thing.” And it may seem even kind of banal to us. But to Erin and her fellow researchers, these are like these precious stones. Precisely, these are the activities that they weren’t able to study or record in a lab and now they’re getting.', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nSo we might not have the experimental control out in the world, but we have something that’s just as valuable, which is reality.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo they could have all the boredom of the lab, but all the novelty possibilities of the real world. That’s a really kind of amazing experiment to have land at your feet.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah. And for Erin, it really gets back to these core questions — what is boredom and what should we do with it?', 'Erin Westgate:', '\\nI think the thing I always try to touch on is that boredom’s not good or bad except that we make it so, that boredom is an important signal. It’s healthy, it’s adaptive. We would not get very far without it. Boredom makes sure that we stay engaged in the world and it doesn’t feel good, but that’s okay. It just depends on how we react to it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn that way, boredom is like all things.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nYeah, it’s like everything else. But with its own unique mysteries, which in this weird, unexpected, accidental way, we just might get to learn a little bit more about.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s super interesting. Well, thanks so much, Joe.', 'Joe Rosenberg:', '\\nThank you, Roman.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThank you so much to Professor Erin Westgate and her doctoral student, Yijun Lin at the University of Florida for helping us investigate the great mystery that is boredom. To learn more about their research, you can visit Erin’s website at erinwestgate.com where you can also volunteer to participate in one of her ongoing COVID-19 studies. Whether you’re bored or not, Erin wants to know.', '——————————————', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNow I’m talking with Delaney Hall, our senior editor who is currently trapped in her home in Santa Fe with two children, two small children.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYes. Yes. I hope you cannot hear them screaming in the background. I actually sent everyone outside because working from your home, there’s no sound isolation.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. There’s no amount of foam padding that will protect you from little children. It’s just the way it is. So how are you coping there with the children?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nWell, I’ve actually been spending a lot of time in a couple of different parenting-related Facebook groups where parents are commiserating with each other and sharing tips about how to get through this crazy time. And I recently came across a post in one of those groups that got me thinking about this idea of “the natural experiment.” The post was about vaccination, which honestly is a subject that does not come up that often in this group.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, I mean, that’s always a hot button topic. And even if you have a strong scientific-based feeling about the subject, you just don’t want to fight with strangers on the internet about it.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, exactly. But this post, just when there, you know, head-on. And to paraphrase, it basically said we’re all terrified of this disease that’s going around and we’re living in lockdown. And, this is what life looks like without vaccines. This is how life used to be. And the post really struck me like I have been thinking a lot about it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat aspect have you been thinking about?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nWell, the sentiments of the post represent my feelings, like I cannot wait for a vaccine. But it also made me wonder about people who are anti-vaccination, like how are they experiencing this moment as the pandemic unfolds? Are people’s minds changing? And so I started looking around for a researcher who studies those issues and who would have some insight into how a pandemic might influence people’s attitudes about vaccines.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nYou know, this is a generation-defining experience. My dad’s 95. He doesn’t remember anything ever like this in his lifetime.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nThis is Dr. Bernice Hausman and she leads the Department of Humanities within the Penn State College of Medicine.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nSo it’s almost like too big an experience when you’re in it to figure out how you’re going to study it.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo what Dr. Hausman’s studies is the history and meaning of anti-vaccination sentiment. She looks at what vaccine dissenters actually believe and why. And more broadly, she’s interested in medical controversies that spill over into the public realm and become social controversies.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nThis interface between science and society, right? You have to work with people, which means you’re working with culture and tradition and ritual and history, not just with science.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd if it were just science, then there wouldn’t be a controversy, right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI mean, this is a situation where the scientific evidence shows that vaccines are really important, like essential for public health. But that hasn’t changed the fact that there are people skeptical about them.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight. And if you understand the history of where that skepticism comes from and why it’s so durable and how it connects to these very big ideas about individual freedom and state power, all of that helps you understand why the phenomenon continues today, even in the middle of a global pandemic. So Roman, do you want to hear some really disgusting early vaccination history?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely!', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nI thought you would. Okay, so the earliest method of immunization, which dates back to the 10th century was something called “variolation” and it was used to protect people against smallpox. And the way it worked is that you would scrape a little pus out of a smallpox blister and then scratch your arm and put the pus into the wound. Or alternately, you could also take a scab from the smallpox blister and then crush it up and suck it up your own nose. With either method, the idea was that hopefully, a mild and protective infection would result.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nThat idea that if they had a mild course of the disease, they would not be scarred and they would survive. It had a pretty significant mortality rate, but not as high as smallpox itself.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd so after a while, variolation spread from China and India, where it originated, into the West, and eventually, the practice gave way to vaccination. In the late seventeen hundreds, an English physician named Edward Jenner made a vaccine for smallpox that was based on cowpox, a related animal infection. And amazingly, that’s actually where the word vaccination comes from. It’s based on the Latin word “vacca” for cow. So a lot of people welcomed the many new vaccines that began to develop from that point forward. But there were also objections right from the start.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nSome of them, based on the notion that you should not mess around with nature, it’s always dangerous to mess around with nature, and people who do so are punished. There were some anti-scientific arguments based on the notion that naturally becoming ill was preferable to being vaccinated. There were perceptions of the dangers of vaccination. So all of the same concerns that we see today in contemporary vaccination dissent, you can see them historically.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd a big sticking point for a lot of people were vaccine mandates. People hated the idea of the state requiring them to vaccinate, which started happening pretty quickly. Great Britain implemented compulsory vaccination in the mid-eighteen hundreds. And people actually rioted.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI don’t know. I mean, I think that people, when it comes to civil liberties, they really think about their bodies as the ultimate dividing line that, that’s only theirs. But you can see why they would be required because you would mandate a vaccine because it only works if a critical mass of people do it. You have to get that herd immunity going.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. Exactly. And so it kind of presents this catch-22.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nIf you didn’t have the mandate, you probably wouldn’t have the movement because the mandate is what forces people who don’t want to vaccinate to vaccinate their children. So our mandates the way to go? That is a really interesting question because it feels like mandates are both very American and very un-American in the sense that we really have a tradition of individual personal liberty in this country and the notion that the state cannot make you do certain things. And so I don’t think the mandates are going away, but I do think that we see the friction that they cause at the political level.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo here in the U.S., vaccine dissenters organized to challenge those mandates. And then eventually in 1905, there was a famous Supreme Court case which you actually covered on Trump Con Law a couple of weeks ago.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI know this one. This is Jacobson versus Massachusetts, which upheld the rights of states to enforce vaccination laws. And it basically said that sometimes public welfare is more important than individual freedom.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight. And even though the decision did allow for some exemptions, it was one of the things that really mobilized the anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. It provided fuel. And as time went on, Dr. Hausman said that two broad groups of vaccine dissenters began to emerge.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nOne group is a sort of more ideologically anti-vaccination group. So this is the group that is against the science of vaccination. They may use their own scientific evidence. They’re largely middle-class, educated people who believe that vaccination is dangerous or wrong in some way. And then there’s another group of people, often working-class people who object to the government’s intrusion on the family.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo these are people who believe the government just should not be telling people what to do with their bodies, kind of like you were talking about earlier, that that is the realm of the individual. That is the realm of the family. And it’s worth pointing out that sometimes this was for good reason. You know, working-class people, in general, had a harder time getting out of vaccination. People with more money could just pay a fine and skip it. So working-class people were often forced to do this thing that they objected to.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nWhat you tend to see in the United States at least, is a mingling of arguments about freedom and about individual rights with the notion of bodily danger.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd this idea of bodily danger is really compelling to people. Dr. Hausman made this point that was really interesting. She said that public support for vaccination is actually very fragile, meaning that even if the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, all it takes for some people to abandon it is just a small number of bad outcomes.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so what are some examples of that?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo something that you can see historically is the power of media that highlights a few vivid worst-case scenarios. Dr. Hausman traces the modern anti-vaccination movement to the 1970s, and that was when parents started to express concerns about the original pertussis vaccine, which caused high fevers and febrile seizures in some children.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nIn the 1970s, there was an increasing belief that it could cause some neurological damage. There was a paper that was published in Britain claiming that it actually did so. There is controversy about whether or not that paper is valid.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd in the early 1980s, there was an influential TV news story called “Vaccine Roulette” that highlighted some of these concerns. It aired on a local NBC affiliate in Washington, DC.', 'VACCINE ROULETTE CLIP', '\\n[It’s a fact of life, all children must get four DPT shots to go to school. Shots, we are told, will keep our children healthy. Shots, we are told, will protect every child from a dreaded disease, pertussis, its whooping cough. But the DPD shot can also damage to a devastating degree.]', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nThe report caused a lot of controversy. In general, it emphasized the risks of the vaccine while minimizing the dangers of the actual disease, and some of its more serious claims have since been debunked by further research. The story gave a big platform for this group called “Dissatisfied Parents Together,” which would go on to become the National Vaccine Information Center. And that’s one of the biggest “vaccine safety” organizations in the country. Many people would call them anti-vaxxers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnother example I’m thinking of in terms of like a single article that had outsized influence was the Andrew Wakefield — just completely fraudulent paper that linked the MMR vaccine to autism, which had no basis in anything. But it became the starting point.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, that one came out in 1998 and it’s been very damaging. As you said, there’s no link between MMR and autism, but that association continues and it still motivates some vaccine refusal. So those are a couple of the big moments that get us to where we are today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo now that we’re in this moment where an infectious disease affects our daily lives, like the coronavirus pandemic, what is Dr. Hausman seeing in these different movements?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo right now, she’s just observing and formulating some questions that might be interesting to investigate. And to start with, she says that this is a really interesting time to be studying vaccination dissent because what we’re experiencing is really unprecedented. This is the first big worldwide pandemic of the vaccine era.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nWe haven’t had one since we’ve had all these vaccines. That’s really the case, right? The last big pandemic like this was in 1918.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo what Dr. Hausman is doing is she’s checking on these online hubs like the National Vaccine Information Center to see how they’re messaging around the issue of the coronavirus and among hardcore ideological anti-vaxxers, there is a lot of fear. People are seeing the government enact these stay-at-home orders requiring businesses to close.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nThey see the heavy hand of government coming down and they are concerned about what might happen with respect to vaccines. And is this going to embolden states to use these same powers to compel vaccine use? There’s a whole set of concerns around that.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI feel like I’ve actually seen some of this manifesting in the protests against the state-at-home orders. They’re pretty small, but they’ve been happening last couple weeks. And if you watch the footage, you will see anti-vax signage along with signs that talk about tyranny and, you know, needing haircuts and stuff like that. It seems to be part of that same worldview.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah, it’s in the mix at those protests and it’s just clear that the government orders have people quite worried. I came across this video that a pastor who is also anti-vaccination posted on Twitter recently.', 'TWITTER VIDEO', '\\n[Pastor: They will be sipping Frosty’s in the lake of fire before the government ever gets their greasy, grimy hands on me and my family and forces us to take a stupid implant or a vaccination that we don’t believe in. I have a First Amendment right that allows me to reject it and say no. I have a Second Amendment right that protects my first one and I have a God-given right to tell you, you have got buck wild. The government is out of control and Christians, you need to wake up.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe mingling of fear about state power and anti-vaccination seems to be kind of a natural mix that’s happening right now.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. I mean, it is not the case that the pandemic is causing really hardcore anti-vaccination people to rethink their views, as I perhaps naively thought it would. In fact, it seems to be creating this environment where some people are really doubling down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. So I can imagine that the anti-vax pastor, whose whole identity is wrapped up in this, not budging. But is there may be some people on the edges that might be just a little wary of vaccines that, when presented with a world in which a vaccine would greatly improve the quality of life all around the world, are they moving at all?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nDr. Hausman does think this experience will probably affect the views of people who are vaccine-hesitant. So they don’t have super strong beliefs about vaccine. They’re not connected to these communities and movements of vaccine dissenters. But they are people who’ve picked up a sense of unease about vaccination. She thinks that those people, the hesitant people, might, in fact, come around to the idea that vaccination is a really good thing. And in fact, there’s this technology that she’s keeping an eye on. And this is more about the design of one of the potential coronavirus vaccines. So as you know, there are teams of researchers all around the world looking for a vaccine. And one of them is being developed at the University of Pittsburgh.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nAnd one of the interesting things about their vaccine is it’s not given through a shot. It’s given as a patch.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nIt’s this little patch that looks like a translucent square.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo how does that work? I can’t even imagine it.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. So you place it on your skin, kind of like a Band-Aid. And then over the course of a few days, it delivers the vaccine to your body through these tiny little needles.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nSo there’s a number of reasons why this is a really interesting technology. First of all, a lot of people don’t like shots. Second of all, there’s some arguments that the skin is actually a better tissue for vaccine absorption than intramuscular injection.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nBut then there’s this other reason, which is more about the psychology of vaccines.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nThink about what it would mean if you went to the doctor’s office and instead of giving your child shots, they gave you like four patches and said, okay, over the next two weeks, we’ll do them in this sequence and then you can see if there’s an adverse reaction to one of them. You’re sort of more in control as a parent. And even if it’s the same delivery of the same vaccines, that totally changes your relationship to the entire process.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWell, that is really interesting. I remember when my kids were born, there was a movement among people who were in favor of vaccination but felt maybe the MMR was too much vaccination at once. And it wouldn’t it be great if they gave them one at a time, for example?', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nRight.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so this seems to like this ability to give you control and to sort of test and watch your child because your child is not like every other child. It’s just “your child” and so they have a specific reaction to everything that you can watch for. I can see why that would psychologically help people out who were having a problem.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. And you know, as a parent, I can understand the appeal, too. And I think Dr. Hausman is hoping that this might be the vaccine that actually gets developed and licensed because she wants to study that reaction. She wants to study how the mechanism of delivery might change people’s attitudes about the vaccine.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nAnd what’s interesting is that ultimately what she’s seen in this moment displays a lot of the same dynamics we’ve seen over and over again in history, which is that even when there’s overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines are good for public health, and we’re getting a very real illustration of that right now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone just gets on board.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd so, I guess in order to have effective public health measures, whether or not you agree or disagree, you just have to grapple with that. You have to figure out how to reach people.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nYeah. She said this super interesting thing towards the end of our conversation.', 'Dr. Bernice Hausman:', '\\nScience-based medicine is a tremendous advantage that we have in the modern world. The fact that they could sequence the genome of the coronavirus so quickly, the fact that they’re talking about a vaccine within 18 months to two years is phenomenal, right? All of that is based on advancements in medicine. But the experience of the pandemic, the social disruption that it has caused, the difficulties of discrimination and unequal treatment that the pandemic has uncovered. We already knew it. But now we know it even more. All of that is the realm of the social world. And all of that is much more difficult in some ways to handle.', 'Delaney Hall:', '\\nSo in other words, science is the easy part. You know, and people are hard.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nComing up, experimenting with our city streets now that vehicular traffic is down and pedestrians are everywhere.', '——————————————', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo our city of Oakland made its way into the national news recently for a policy initiative that I think our urbanist fans will probably appreciate — they banned cars.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s right. I mean, they banned cars in a lot of streets. It was really remarkable.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. I mean, it wasn’t all cars and it was all streets, but the measure came in response to crowding concerns that they were seeing at local parks and around Lake Merritt, downtown. We’re all cooped up in our houses and in the streets are the one place where we can go for a walk or a run. But with everyone doing that, it’s creating problems.', 'Ryan Russo:', '\\nPeople were sort of encountering each other on the sidewalk and making a decision up ahead, having this little dance. Who’s going to walk out onto the street? Who’s gonna cross over to the other street?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Ryan Russo, director of the Oakland Department of Transportation.', 'Ryan Russo:', '\\nSomeone going for a run saying, “Okay, you don’t want me to go down to the lake where I normally run, so I’ll run in the neighborhood. But I don’t want to breathe heavy on people on the sidewalk, so I’m going to do that in a street, too.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI don’t know about you, Roman, but I’ve been going on a lot of runs these days, wearing a mask. And I’ve just decided that the safest way is just to go right down the middle of the road. Most sidewalks are less than six feet across. So there’s just not enough room to safely share one with another pedestrian. And so the city of Oakland decided with that in mind, just to close a whole bunch of streets to cars to give people more room.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. And it’s like dozens of miles of streets, right?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. So the city already has this network of what they call “bike boulevards.” And that’s about 74 miles total.', 'Ryan Russo:', '\\nIntend to already be low traffic volume, but connect you to things in the neighborhoods. They actually get you places. It’s not just a cul de sac. And what we are doing is selecting from those 74 miles which ones should get soft closure treatments.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“Soft closures” mean that they’re basically throwing up a temporary roadblock and a “5 mile per hour” sign. The streets are still open to people who live there, delivery trucks, and emergency vehicles. But otherwise, the street is for pedestrians and bicyclists and little kids on scooters and dads doing jump rope.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat’s interesting about this is that a lot of urbanists have wanted this for a long time, pandemic or no pandemic. They just wanted to see the streets, you know, used for other purposes other than driving.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight. Right. I mean, we’ve talked about this a lot on the show. And so I asked Ryan Russo whether this policy was part of a larger transportation vision that he had for the city.', 'Ryan Russo:', '\\nWhat we’re doing now is focused on helping Oakland at this moment. And that is number one. That said, we’re learning. We can’t help but learn from observing how that’s going. And while we’re taking quick action, we’re not doing something that’s particularly expensive or permanent. So if it’s not working, it’s quite easy to pick up the barricades and sign strapped to them and adjust what we’re doing.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nIs there any way that any chance that, you know, when this is all over, some of these streets might stay “slow streets?”', 'Ryan Russo:', '\\nI mean, I think that with the work we’re doing on Oakland’s slow streets, we’re focused on keeping people safe now. I do think it’s a great experiment. And as we hear from our communities, “Hey, that was working or that wasn’t,” we’re going to have our ear to the ground for that and we’ll respond accordingly.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat sounds like a definite maybe.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I think we got to maybe. But I wanted to talk with an urbanist about this. And so I called up Allison Arieff. She’s that editorial director for the transportation think tank “SPUR.” And she said she’s really encouraged by what’s happening in Oakland.', 'Allison Arieff:', '\\nI think what this has shown is, one, you can do these really fast. You know, it just put up a bunch of cones and you have a bike lane instead of having 100 committee meetings over how horrible this is going to be, and no one’s going to use them, and all the other arguments that people make. Like, just do it. And yeah, it will come to light that like, you know what, the street didn’t make the most sense, but this one’s really working. And the only way to do it is try and to just be able to throw something on the ground is great.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd she says that throughout history, moments of crisis have also been moments of experimentation inside cities, chances for cities to try things out, try to make themselves better, more livable.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight. I mean, it took Chicago burning to the ground to totally remake the grid of Chicago. And even more akin to what’s happening now, Central Park in New York came about partially as a reaction to the cholera epidemics of the 19th century. We need more space for people to be and exist.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd even more recently, just look at the last recession, which was obviously terrible for cities, but it also gave rise to all these tactical urbanism projects in cities like San Francisco.', 'Allison Arieff:', '\\nThat’s why we have all these parklets. And that’s why we have the proxy Shipping Container Project that used a lot that no one could afford to develop and turned it into this very public space. And that stuff has stayed around.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd, you know, some cities around the world are already planning to use this crisis as a chance to remake themselves. Milan just announced that they would use this summer to transform over 20 miles of streets into spaces for pedestrians and bicyclists. And Alison has hope that in Oakland and elsewhere in this country, maybe some of these experiments in traffic reduction might stick.', 'Allison Arieff:', '\\nI think people are still figuring it out. But ultimately, I think this is a huge indicator of how much more space we could give to the public. And I’m not going to say like, “oh, there will be no cars in our post-COVID future,” but hopefully, people will understand, “wow, it actually feels quite liberating to walk down the street.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\n99 % invisible was produced this week by Emmet FitzGerald, Delaney Hall, and Joe Rosenberg.

First, we are mourning the loss of architect Michael McKinnell, along with Gerhard Kallmann, McKinnell designed the unforgettable Boston City Hall completed in 1968. They won the commission for Boston City Hall after submitting their brutalist heroic monument in a contest when Michael McKinnell was just 26 years old. It was always a controversial structure. Much of the public found it ugly and too unconventional. But architects and critics tend to love it.

I didn’t see no reason for me to stop.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“But weren’t you scared about your business? Because it did, I mean…”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“I grew up… Let’s go back. I come from the poorest neighborhood in Harlem. All I know is the system constantly stepping on me, stepping on me, stepping on us. So you had to learn to step back, figure out ways to navigate the system. That’s the way I looked at it. Here’s another obstacle, let’s deal with it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDapper Dan always knew what he was doing was illegal, always, but he had tangled with the law before in much more serious ways. He was used to hustling. So when the luxury brands came after Dan, he just found another way to go on.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“So I go underground.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“What did that look like?”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“That was hell, but it was necessary.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDapper Dan kept selling his work the way he used to sell his stolen clothes — out of his car. He lived as a nomad.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\nI went underground. I had to make clothes. And I would hit every black city from here to Chicago, then come back and hit every black city from here to Atlanta. And that sustained me for 20 years.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTwenty years. Twenty years away from the eyes of Gucci and Prada and all the major brands you would expect to get upset about trademark infringement and call in the federal marshals. The law was pretty cut and dry. As our expert Professor Raustiala said…', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nIt’s like a two-dimensional image, you can protect that.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt seems pretty simple, but that’s not how the law truly functions. When I think of a knockoff, I think of the imitation bags on Canal Street. I think of small vendors stealing the trademarks of huge companies. But big, wealthy, multinational fashion companies knock off small designers all the time – all the time – to the point where most of us might not realize we’re buying knockoffs at all.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\n“When I first saw it, I was like, maybe it was a mistake. And then-”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Like they made a mistake.”', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\n“Maybe I made a mistake, in thinking that it was too similar. I was like, maybe they don’t know.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is Tuesday Bassen. She’s an illustrator. And that’s how she got into the world of clothing.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nI started making clothes when I moved to LA. At the time I had put out a zine called “Ugly Girl Gang,” and the three girls on the front cover I had drawn were wearing satin jackets.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd on the back of their satin jackets are hearts that say “Mixed Emotions Club”.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nSo many people would be like, “Oh, I would wear that jacket.” Being in LA, and being around clothing manufacturing, I was like, “Maybe I can make that jacket.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTuesday made her first bomber jacket in 2015. It looked exactly like the one her character in her zine is wearing. It’s satin with a big heart across the back that says “Mixed Emotions Club.”', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nIt sold out and I made some more.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTuesday went on to design an entire line of pins and patches and accessories and clothes in a wide range of sizes. A lot of her illustrations are integrated into her clothing, so it’s an extremely personal thing. Which is why it was almost painful in 2016, when the fast fashion behemoth Zara sold a line of designs that looked exactly like Tuesday’s.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nIt was my entire catalog of goods on their products, on various products, shirts, patches, everything.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is illegal, especially since Tuesday had already registered her images.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nI am somewhat proactive about being litigious, and already had trademarks on most of the designs.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“That’s so smart.”', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo Tuesday did what you’re supposed to do. She issued a cease and desist notice.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nI think the scariest thing about it is that Inditex, the parent company of Zara, is the largest fast fashion company in the world.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTheir founder, Amancio Ortega, at one point was actually the sixth wealthiest man on earth.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nAccusing the largest brand in the world, largest fast fashion brand in the world, of stealing my intellectual property is scary. It’s terrifying.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn this David and Goliath story, Tuesday summoned all her courage and threw a stone at the giant. And Goliath didn’t flinch. He barely even noticed.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nI got a letter back that basically said, “We’re big, you’re little. What do you want to do about? Nobody knows about who you are.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen most people bought those Tuesday knockoffs from Zara, they had no idea they were knockoffs at all. To fight for her own integrity, Tuesday filed suit against Inditex.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nHaving a lawsuit is not very fun.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAlso, the legal costs mean nothing to Zara. To a small designer, it’s considerable.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nGood lawyers are so expensive. I mean, bad lawyers are so expensive, you know? It’s just exhausting to have to consistently defend what is legally yours.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTuesday’s lawsuit eventually ended.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nGod, last year, yeah. So for years it went on.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe only thing Tuesday can legally say about the situation now is that it was resolved to their mutual satisfaction. Anticlimactic, I know. But the kicker is, it’s not like Tuesday can relax now.', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nWell, absolutely it is happening again. Actually, Bershka, another company by Inditex, who own Zara, has infringed on one of the same designs.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“No way.”', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOn a hat was a little heart, and inside it said “Mixed Emotions Club.”', 'Tuesday Bassen:', '\\nIt’s frustrating and it’s exhausting. But I also feel like, if I don’t continue to defend my brand and defend my intellectual property, this will continue happening to me. And it will happen to other people too.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis happens all the time. All the time. Everyone working as a designer knows it, to the point where it’s nearly unavoidable. In theory, the rules around trademark are supposed to be a bit of a trade-off. Yes, these laws might prevent independent designers like Dapper Dan from remixing other people’s images, but these laws are also supposed to protect designers like Tuesday from having their original images ripped off. And these stopgaps just aren’t working. The bigger, wealthier party always seems to win. It’s devastating for the little designer on either side of the law. Tuesday gets caught in litigation for years and years, and Dapper Dan has to go underground for decades.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\nBut that was my reaction to the opposition that I encountered. Not to get mad because they raided me. “Okay, this is what y’all do? This is what I do.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter 20 years underground, driving across all the major black cities in America, something really unexpected thrust Dapper Dan back into the spotlight. It was May of 2017 when Gucci sent a jacket down the runway for their Cruise Collection. It was a very distinctive jacket with a black fur torso and huge, puffy, leather balloon sleeves covered in G’s. This jacket looked almost exactly like a design Dan made back in the 80s. Really, like, identical.', '(music)', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIf you look at the images of Dapper Dan’s original and Gucci’s version of the jacket, Gucci very obviously indirectly knocked him off, 100% definitely. And, unlike what Dapper Dan had been doing, Gucci wasn’t remixing something old into something new. They just made an exact replica. While Gucci could call the federal marshals on Dapper Dan, Dapper Dan didn’t have that option. And it was not because Gucci is big and Dapper Dan is small. It’s because what Gucci did is perfectly legal.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nThe design in the American system is fully copyable.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nGucci wasn’t copying a two-dimensional image. It wasn’t a logo or a pattern. They were copying the design of the garment – the shape and the cut and the material. And you can totally just do that.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nThe American fashion industry is very, very successful. It makes a lot of money, it’s worldwide in its reach, it’s done very well over the last few decades. And yet the core idea, the design, can be copied by anyone, and is copied by anyone.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIf you come up with a cool sleeve or a really different looking collar, you have no claim to it in the American copyright system. If you come up with something that’s useful or technologically innovative, like maybe it’s a new kind of sweat-wicking fabric, maybe you could get a patent.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nIn theory, a unique kind of toggle or button could be patented. It has to be non-obvious and novel. It’s a much higher hurdle to get a patent.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut otherwise, no. All designs are fair game. The argument for this lack of regulation is that it keeps the fashion cycle churning. After all, a trend means a thing that everyone is copying. New styles proliferate and spread, and we all go out shopping. And new styles proliferate and spread, and we all go out shopping. And new styles proliferate and spread, and we all go out shopping.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nYes. What copying does is enable the fashion cycle, the cycle of something coming into fashion and going out, it enables that to move more quickly.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nKal Raustiala and his co-author Chris Sprigman make this argument in their book, “The Knockoff Economy.” In fashion, everyone copies each other all the time because the clothing industry runs on a fuel concocted of desire and trend proliferation. You might buy a new phone every few years because the technology improves, but shirts generally don’t get better at shirting. You consume as your taste changes, and designers have to appeal to what you like and what style is in. And so they steal from each other.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nSometimes people take the view that copying is the ransom of success, and it’s a good thing, or it’s part of the ether, we just let it happen. It’s a little easier when you’re a really big company to do that. When you’re a small firm, it’s a little tougher.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nEvery couple of years, new legislation is brought forward to make American fashion law more strict, and it always falls through. Professor Raustiala argues that the reason is that fashion copyright is a double-edged sword. If you tighten up the rules to protect independent designers, you also tighten up the rules to protect major fashion houses who stand to gain far more than they have to lose. He argues that if fashion copyright was written more strictly and/or enforced more heavily, it could have odd cultural ripple effects.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nWell, this is really an idea that I don’t want to claim. It’s a colleague of ours at NYU, Barton Beebe, who really first talked about this. But sumptuary codes in the past dictated who could wear what, and only certain classes of people could wear certain clothing.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd stricter fashion law could function like modern sumptuary codes. In a world with much stricter fashion copyright, if you wanted to wear something new and cool or trendy right now, you couldn’t unless you wanted to pay hundreds of dollars for the authentic, trend-setting designer piece. Even if you made your own version, if you sewed a particular kind of dress or blouse inspired by something you saw on Instagram, you could be sued for infringement.', 'Kal Raustiala:', '\\nAnd so one of the great things about the freedom to copy that we currently have is it enables everyone to wear designs. If a really popular design comes out of, let’s say Prada, at a very high price point, the average person, let alone a poor person, could never afford it. But the ability to knock off the design means that they too can wear that design, and they have access to it.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAlthough, let’s not take a democracy of goods as an actual form of democracy. You know our world is already fractured into tiers. People who take the bus, and people who take a Lyft; first class, business class, and extra leg room; those who can actually afford a $2,000 bag, and those who buy them on Canal Street; the designers who are big enough to protect their work, and those who aren’t.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“So were you upset when you saw them using your-”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“No, I expect that. Even to this day, I never expect people to play fair.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDapper Dan himself had grown accustomed to injustice. But as soon as photos of Gucci’s jacket hit the Internet, Black Twitter was like, “Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\nBlack Twitter hit. I said, “Wow, it’s that powerful?” I never had a voice before.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe online fashion world was outraged. People who remembered the jacket dredged it up again, and Dapper Dan was back on everyone’s lips for the first time in decades.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\nThen all the social media started hitting, and people became familiar with where all these fashion ideas came from.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nA torrent of Internet outrage was directed towards Gucci for copying Dapper Dan. And so Gucci did something very, very smart. They reached out to Dapper Dan only a few months later, in December of 2017, and they offered Dan a position as a designer, but with complete and absolute autonomy.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\nThat’s unheard of, right?', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nNow, Dapper Dan is doing exactly what he did before, still experimenting and remixing and making very expensive custom garments, except now, he can only use Gucci symbols, and his atelier in Harlem has a little Gucci sign out in front. So the big guy still kind of wins, but they’ve let Dapper Dan into the club because Dapper Dan is one of the most influential minds of the 20th century. He’s a success story. He’s a name. In other words, he’s a brand, so of course people are knocking him off.', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“Vendors run up to me and show me their knockoff Dapper Dan that they did personally.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Wait, really?”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“Yes.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“No way!”', 'Dapper Dan:', '\\n“Yes way.

He’s friend #1. He began construction on this beautiful mansion in 1914 and named it Maryhill. There’s some debate about whether he named it for his wife or his daughter because they were both named Maryhill. Sam Hill roped in friends #2, Loïe Fuller, a famous modern dancer, performance artist, and friend to the sculptor Rodin. She helped bring in a collection of Rodin’s original casts to Maryhill. The third friend was Queen Marie of Romania. She had met Sam Hill in his world travels. And she is why the atrium of the Maryhill Museum of Art is full of beautiful Romanian furniture. And the fourth and most important friend, at least for Linda, was Alma de Bretteville Spreckels. She was the wife of Adolph Spreckels, head of the Spreckels Sugar Company.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nWhen I was a little girl, the boxes of sugar in our kitchen were always Spreckels sugar.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAlma became one of the museum’s first trustees and foremost benefactors. Her donation to the museum collection would have the biggest impact on Linda’s life. And it was… a bunch of creepy dolls.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI shouldn’t say this, but I thought they were the most Macabre objects I’d ever seen.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen Linda got to Maryhill, she stumbled on a glass case full of these dolls. And they weren’t like baby dolls. They were clearly supposed to be adults, but they were thin and skeletal and looked like they were out of “The Nightmare Before Christmas.”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nSome of them were taken apart, so you’d see a wire mannequin with a disembodied head. You see these parts — little shoes, little purses, these wire bodies, these very blank ghostlike faces.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe dolls were 27 inches tall, about double the length of your forearm. And they all wore strange dirty dresses and mismatched jackets, all bedraggled from years of volunteers playing with them and switching up their outfits. There were around 50 of these dolls displayed in the glass case, all just bunched up close together like they were on crowded bleachers. A bright fluorescent light flickered above them, accentuating their creepiness. Apparently there were about a hundred more of these dolls in storage. Linda did not know what was up with these dolls, but she couldn’t really dwell on it.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nFrankly, there were so many things that had to be done at Maryhill. Absolutely everything was in some sort of disrepair or dysfunction. Everything. I mean, from the bathrooms to signage…', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo among the Rodin sculptures, the Romanian furniture, a large collection of indigenous art, and a display of chess sets, there were the dirty dolls piling up against the glass showcase in the hall, collecting dust.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nUntil one day when Linda got a call from a curator at the De Young Museum in San Francisco. She asked Linda if she could come to Maryhill because she wanted to see these dolls. And that was when Linda learned what she had on her hands. These dolls weren’t supposed to be so macabre. Actually they were kind of heroes in a way because these dolls had saved French fashion.', '[This is the end of German pride and power in Paris. It began with the fall of France and now amidst the cheers of the people, the Nazi has fallen]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter four devastating years of Nazi occupation, Paris was liberated on August 25th, 1944. Ecstatic, Parisians rejoiced in the streets. Some of them gathered up the ration tickets that had govern their lives and tore them into confetti. And this turned out to be a very bad idea because the war was not over. They’d still need those ration tickets.', '[MUSIC]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn the aftermath of the occupation, more than five million French adults and children didn’t have adequate shelter or food. Parisians dressed in ratty worn clothes walked and bicycled through their dark city. The capital of light, of art, of culture, was a shell of itself. During the course of World War II, Paris lost its position as the epicenter of contemporary fine art. That moved to New York City. The literary world also recentered around New York, but Paris was determined not to lose its soul or at least not to lose everything to New York. Somehow, even though they didn’t have electricity, Paris had to remain a capital of beauty and ideas. It had to retain its title as the capital of fashion.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nLook at it this way, France has been relying on the couture industry and all of the other industries it involves — the textile industry, the industry that makes all of the zippers, the buttons, the hooks, the feather workers, the embroideries.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is Melissa Leventon, an independent curator, fashion historian, and appraiser.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nThat’s been a big part of not only France’s economy, but France’s national identity since the 17th century. They’re not just gonna let that go because of a four-year occupation by Germany. They were not going to let it die without a really tough fight.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBefore the war in 1939, the French fashion industry employed more than 900,000 people. It was the second largest industry in France. And then by the end of the occupation, Paris fashion houses were just gasping for breath. They had no customers and no materials, at all. Everything had gone to the war effort. Shreds of leather and buttons were rare. Even spools of thread were few and far between. And this was really hard for France. I mean, the country has a department of its government devoted to regulating high fashion. It’s called the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture and even in that post-occupation scarcity, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture wanted to send a message to the world.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nWe are still here, we were not destroyed by the war, and we kept our skills. And we might not have much in the way of materials, but we’re just going to figure it out. We survived and we want you to know that we survived. But in order to keep going, we need our customers back.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture came up with an idea. They would gather all the famous French fashion designers together to do a joint fall collection. They would use real fur, real leather, real silk, no compromises. Well, except that everything would have to be in miniature. That way they could scrape together just enough to make tiny outfits, tiny shoes, little purses and gloves and belts, and still use real materials. So they revived an old old French practice. Fashion dolls.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nSo let’s talk about fashion dolls, the way dressmakers and women who were called milliners, marchande de modes. Kind of like the fashion stylists of today. They sent around dolls dressed in the latest fashion.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDolls were in effect the first catalogs. Clothiers were sending out dolls to wealthy families and royal circles way before the first fashion magazine came out in the late 1700s. So the Chambre Syndicale decided to use dolls again. They reached out to fashion houses like Balenciaga and Nina Ricci and Hermes, and they each volunteered to create an outfit or two. The project was organized as a fundraiser for war refugees and victims. It was also an advertising campaign marketing the concept of French chic.', '[MUSIC]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe collection of 228 fashion dolls would be called the “Théâtre de la Mode”, the Theater of Fashion. They would be sent to the major cities across Europe and eventually, America. And each showing would announce to the world that the couture houses in France were still in business, that Paris was still the capital of glamor and luxury, even though the city barely had power. And, okay… so I keep calling them dolls. But I’m wrong. They are not technically dolls.', 'Anna Goodwin:', '\\nWe have doll enthusiasts who are like, “We want to see the dolls.” You can see the mannequins!', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is collections manager Anna Goodwin showing me some of the Théâtre de la Mode mannequins.', 'Anna Goodwin:', '\\nWe definitely, at least I definitely, cringe anytime someone calls them dolls.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThese mannequins were sculpted by the artist Eliáne Bonabel and they are works of art in and of themselves. They were intentionally made with wire limbs and those blank plaster faces so that they would have no personality of their own.', 'Anna Goodwin:', '\\nAbsolutely. Their goal was to create a mannequin that just disappeared.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThey look like sketchbook drawings brought to life. The wire limbs look like 3-D brush marks. The focus is obviously supposed to be on the impeccable clothes like this dress anna showed me in storage.', 'Anna Goodwin:', '\\n“It sort of has a bodice with buttons and a collar.

Like when I think 1940s fashion, I think broad shoulders, pencil skirts, muted colors, practical low-heeled wartime attire. No, these are richly colored, full-skirted affairs with sumptuous overcoats and gowns intricately beaded with thousands of tiny sequins and hair resplendent with exotic bird feathers. There are tiny radiant sundresses that hint at the 1950s to come. And dramatic pleated trousers that I would wear now. And the shoes. Do not get me started on the shoes.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“These are like white leather platform oxfords, I guess, with a tiny buckle. Oh, my God.”', 'Anna Goodwin:', '\\n“The stitching is minute.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe Théâtre de la Mode premiered in March of 1945 in the west wing of the Louvre. It was a massive success.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nSupposedly the installation in Paris raised something like a million French franc, which was a lot of money given the total economic disaster that was France after World War II.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAs Théâtre de la Mode opened in March of 1945, Allied armies were pushing deeper into Germany, liberating French war prisoners. In April of 1945, France discovered the existential horror of the concentration camps. Bleakness was enveloping Europe and the Théâtre de la Mode was a tiny shred of pleasure. The show was extended for weeks and weeks and weeks. This miniature beacon of glamor attracted a hundred thousand visitors who paid what little money they had to witness this luxurious vision of what Paris still was in their imaginations and maybe could be again.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe Louvre’s exhibit of the Théâtre de la Mode ended around the same time that the war did in May of 1945. And so the Théâtre de la Mode went on to the next phase of its mission. The show re-branded in English as “A Fantasy of Fashion” was packed up and shipped to London, then Leeds, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Vienna, all to rave reviews. And then the little mannequins went to show off to the old rival, new York City, to more rapturous crowds.', '[Goring did his best to strip the French style capital of its finest treasure. But there seems to be some things he missed. Certainly pretty snazzy! It looks like it was really worthwhile, freeing Paris.]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn 1946, the Théâtre de la Mode made its final stop, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, and everyone agreed this would be the exhibit’s final resting place. France didn’t want the mannequins anymore.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nThey didn’t need them back. So the De Young had not earmarked funds to return them, like, there was no spare cash in the system.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe Théâtre de la Mode was sent to a department store in downtown San Francisco that was named, confusingly, “The City of Paris”.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nI remember talking to a woman who used to work at City of Paris, saying she remembered seeing them in the basement.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the mannequins just stayed in the basement of the City of Paris department store for years until they were found by a wealthy San Franciscan named Alma de Bretteville Spreckels. In 1952, she shipped them off to her pet project, a museum in rural Washington state. They were sent without any accompanying documents or explanation as to their origin. Perhaps Alma thought these mannequins needed no introduction, that everyone would, of course, remember this worldwide sensation, even though, of course, they didn’t.', 'Melissa Leventon:', '\\nIn a lot of ways, it seems to be the fate of this exhibition to get forgotten about from time to time.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nFrance pretty much forgot about the torture dilemma. To the mannequins were generally assumed to be lost or destroyed. But as you know, they weren’t. The Théâtre de la Mode was perched on a mountain top overlooking the Columbia River Gorge with Linda.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nReally soon after I started at Maryhill, I got this call from a woman named Anna Bennet who was that the textile and costume curator in San Francisco. And she wanted to know if she could drive out to Maryhill Museum and take a look at the Théâtre de la Mode. It was like somebody walked into the museum and provided information that had been missing for a very long time.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen this curator rediscovered the mannequins in the 80s, word traveled around academic fashion circles. A slow trickle of curators and professors and editors made pilgrimages to Maryhill, each one adding a little more to the pool of knowledge. But then finally, the news got to Susan Train, the Paris Bureau Chief for Condé Nast.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nShe was a woman that wielded a lot of power. She was very interested in fashion. She’d been in the fashion industry for her entire life. At the time I met her, she must have been in her 50s, late 50s, maybe.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOf course, Susan Train knew all about the Théâtre de la Mode.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nAnd she knew its importance. And she couldn’t believe that like there was this time capsule. There was this collection sitting in where? Like Goldendale, Washington? What?', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSusan flew from Paris to the Pacific Northwest to see the mannequins.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“And was she wearing heels when she touched down at the Portland Airport?”.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Yeah” (laughs).', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nShe always wore heels and always wore pearls with her blond hair chopped in a chic bob. Oh, and she always carried a purebred long-haired American Kennel Club dachshund with her. Linda remembers she had one named Kniphofia, which is a flower. I had to look it up.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nShe was very intimidating because she was a very tall, thin, elegant, very elegant woman.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLinda tried to roll out the red carpet as best she could. She took Susan to the only place you could eat out for dinner, which was a truck stop across the river called “Jack’s Fine Foods.”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nThis was a woman that I’m sure that French fry rarely crossed her lips.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen Linda took Susan to the Maryhill Museum to see the Théâtre de la Mode, Susan adored it. She could see past the grime and the mismatched outfits and recognize what it once had been.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nAnd she looked at the Théâtre de la Mode and she fell in love. It was kind of love at first sight.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd there was another love blossoming. Between Linda and Susan. Not in a romantic way.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nMaybe it was an older sister-younger sister relationship.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nListen. You can hear it in Linda’s voice.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nShe wore these big earrings that were cut glass but was like a big chunk of rock on her ear. And they were so shockingly beautiful to me. I’d really never seen anything like that. I remember once at lunchtime, I would say, “Oh, Susan, I really… Those earrings. I just love them.” And she immediately popped them off her ears and handed to me and said, “I want you to have them.” She was generous like that. She was extremely generous.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI mean, how could you not be completely taken with this glamorous person? It’s the same thing that drew 100,000 starving French people to stare at the Théâtre de la Mode. Glamor and luxury are powerful.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSusan knew she had to bring these mannequins back to Paris, to revive the Théâtre de la Mode back to its former glory.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nShe went back to Paris and got busy.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSusan did her Paris Condé Nast bureau chief thing and pulled together an elite team to refurbish the Théâtre de la Mode.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nThere were moth holes and the mannequins themselves, some of them had to be resoldered and somethings had to be re-created. And then maybe the most vexing thing was that well-meaning volunteers over the years had changed all the clothes. So they were no way in their original ensembles.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis was a team effort from a crew of set designers, clothiers, and historians. Experts and artists reference the black and white photographs from the original show and talked with the fashion houses to make sure the outfits were perfectly restored. Leather was polished. Silk was dry cleaned. Diamond jewelry was reconstructed. Real hair replaced and combed. And once again, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture was footing the bill. The cool thing was that many of the original artisan designers who worked on a project in the 40s were still alive to oversee the revival in the 80s, this labor of love they all thought they had lost. And if the mannequins were going to Paris, Linda had to go with them. She had to ensure they were safe because they were still in the Maryhill Collection. But also, there were many parties and celebrations to attend.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nWell, I remember I had bought outfits for all of these events that were taking place in Paris, and I thought I knew what I was doing. But the minute I got to Paris, Susan wanted to… like, “What do you what did you bring?” So I took all of the clothes that I had brought from home to her apartment one Saturday. And she was like, “No. No. No.”.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere is nothing wrong with Linda’s look. Susan was just on a whole other level.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI ended up – because she’d so disapproved of what I had brought from Oregon – I ended up wearing a lot of her clothes to these events. I think it was important to her that I looked a certain way and I certainly did not want to disappoint her.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nFor the next two years, as the mannequins were being fixed up, Linda went back and forth from Paris to Goldendale, from champagne toasts to rattlesnakes and back again. Little by little, she was becoming more glamorous under the tutelage of Susan Train.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nWhenever I came to Paris, Susan always made sure there were flowers in my hotel room when I arrived. The most astonishing bouquets, like a profusion of pink lilies. She arranged for me to have my hair done. She arranged for me to have my makeup done. She arranged for me to have a pearl choker made.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Made?”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Made. She actually marched me… like she just put me in the car with her driver, and she would come along with her little dog. And there was a jewelry store. It was just, “I know just where I need to take you for a pearl choker.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt was a real classic makeover montage.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“I actually have a scrapbook I could pull out and show you.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Could you?”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLinda has kept nearly every party invitation, every dinner menu. And in her scrapbook, there are lots and lots of photos. And Linda looks like a supermodel. She’s tall and thin with blonde bobbed hair and her three-strand pearl choker, always with a drink in hand, flushed with laughter. Théâtre de la Mode was reopened in Paris in May of 1990. At the Musée des Arts de la Mode. It was a smash success. There were parties and photoshoots and press interviews and it was like Linda had gone through the looking glass. She was living the very fantasy that the Théâtre de la Mode represented. Case in point, back in Washington state, Linda had cut out an article from Vogue about the up and coming dress designer Herve Leger. And in Paris, Susan brought Linda to Herve Leger’s studio to get a dress fitted for her. It’s simple. Black and white with a drop waist. In her blonde bob and her Herve Leger dress, Linda looked like a 90s flapper. It was like a fairy tale, especially because this Herve Leger dress was for an actual ball.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter France, the Théâtre de la Mode was exhibited at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it was on display during the Met Gala that year. And the Met Gala is just the fashion party. In 1990, Linda received an invitation.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI was kind of bedazzled with the opportunity of going to this incredibly glamorous dinner party at the Met. Like who would ever think that was gonna happen when I moved to Maryhill Museum in 1983.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd I can’t help but notice, as the pictures in her scrapbook progress, Linda starts to look more and more like Susan.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nSomebody once laughed like, “Oh, Linda. You’re Susan’s little mannequin. Like she’s dressing you.” She had opinions about how I looked. She did. In an Eliza Doolittle way, like “I can teach you how to be chic.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSusan wanted to teach and Linda wanted to learn. They were getting closer.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nWe did love each other. We really did. We did love each other. We were very, very good friends.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut Linda started imitating Susan in other ways, too. Less healthy ones.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI’m sure she was naturally thin. So staying in that body that I had in Paris, in New York, was really hard and took a lot of time.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLinda was eating less and as she put it, exercising like a crazy person.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“And then you’d get back to Goldendale and you’d still be like running and dieting.”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Yes. Definitely.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Really?”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Yeah. I didn’t want to disappoint Susan.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI know exactly what Linda is talking about. I think a lot of people do. There were years in my life where I tried to starve myself, and definitely a big part of it was I wanted to fit into beautiful clothing. And when you are intentionally starving yourself, that is a task that takes over your whole brain. I didn’t think about anything else.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nIt’s not sustainable and it’s not even very fun. Because you’re constantly… You’re thinking all the goddamn time about what you’re going to eat or not eat. So your entire world, like it kind of pains me to think of those years, like not thinking about other things, but thinking about assiduously writing down every calorie in a little notebook.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn this condition, you feel like you’re not human. You can’t eat meals and just enjoy life the way other people can. But I did it in pursuit of glamor. Of something that ascends to a higher plane than normal life. Something that’s impossible.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nYou can’t stay this thin for that long. You can’t. I mean, I couldn’t. And it created a real crisis of confidence.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nEven Susan could see that Linda wasn’t doing well.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nShe was a little worried about me, at how thin I had become. I remember at one lunch, we were having lunch together and she insisted on getting a bowl of strawberries and whipped cream for dessert. And I remember her sitting there saying, “Linda, eat!”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter New York, the Théâtre de la Mode went to Tokyo and so did Linda. But in the pictures in her scrapbook, all the glamor appears to be taking a toll on her. She actually gained a lot of weight in only a few months from all the stress and traveling, and she was spending a lot of money.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nOh, I put myself into debt by chasing… like having to have the Herve Leger. I don’t regret it. It was really exciting to wear that dress for one night at the Costume Institute Gala. I would do it again, but it had major repercussions in my life that lasted for a long time.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Financial repercussions?”', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\n“Financial repercussions. Body dysmorphia.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLinda started to wonder exactly why she was doing all this.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nLike, how much did I want to be like Susan Train? Susan was in many ways a very lonely person.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I didn’t want to depend on anyone for anything,” Susan Train told a Vogue journalist in 2007. “I never wanted to be identified with one clique”. The profile adds that Susan Train knew every designer but kept a professional distance and that she intentionally did not spend time with Americans. Linda apparently was an exception.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nWell, I learned that what appears to be very glamorous can be very lonely.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd watching Susan, Linda realized that she didn’t want to be quite so addicted to her work or quite so lonely or quite so thin. And then the best possible thing happened. The show ended. The Théâtre de la Mode went back to Maryhill and so did Linda. Back to her little house on the cliff. This whirlwind experience made Linda ready to move on. She went to live in New York for a spell and then eventually went back west. She lives in Portland now and she’s spent much of her career working in museums and collections there. She can drive to the Maryhill Museum of Art in two hours. And she does every so often. To remember this beacon of hope for postwar France and this evidence of a parallel life she once had. Because the other witnesses to her story are mostly gone.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nMy husband John met Susan and went to France for a honeymoon. We went to Paris. It was so great to see Susan. We had meals together and it was the last time I saw her.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nMost of the artisans and experts and historians who were involved with the mannequins in both of their incarnations have passed away. In a lot of ways, the story has become Linda’s.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI’m kind of sick of people talking about like, you know, “I did this, or I had this and it changed my life, a life-changing experience.” This actually changed my life. It taught me lessons that I think about today.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAfter our weekend together, Linda sent me a quote that she had heard a long time ago which had stayed with her. It was attributed to Ben Brantley, the theater critic for the New York Times. “Glamor is whatever you can’t have. It is best perceived at a distance, either literally or emotionally. Knowledge kills glamor.” This just seems so utterly true to Linda. She experienced the shadow side of her jet-set life with Susan. She knew about the suffering and deep trauma behind the tiny mannequins. And yet I personally don’t know if knowledge kills glamor entirely, wounds it severely for sure, but it’s hard to completely destroy the illusion. The aspirational pull of fashion carves out a space in our imagination. That’s why we dream of Paris, why we want to see Cardi B on the red carpet in vintage couture.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nGlamor involves so much delicate placement of smoke and mirrors for the people who occupy that rarefied air, so much so that the pleasure in it is really ours. We, the viewing public, the audience. Linda knows this, and I think that’s why she enjoys the show.', 'Linda Tesner:', '\\nI don’t wanna go anyplace else on the night of the Oscars. I want to be in front of my TV with absolute silence and I just want to watch but I don’t want to be that and I don’t even want to be in that world. Not again.

But he famously lost the American colonies.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBeau’s father was Lord North’s private secretary and made an unusually large amount of money in that job.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nIt was what was known in the 18th century as peculation, which I think now we call embezzlement.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd so Beau grew up around wealth. He was accustomed to it. He went to fancy schools. He knew all the right people. And when his parents died when he was teenager, he inherited the family fortune. Beau mostly spent his days gambling and going to the theater and just being handsome and witty.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nFamous, initially, for being the wittiest man in London.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nReading his quotes, I don’t know if I would call him witty as much as I would call him… mean? To give you an idea, here’s a classic Beau Brummell zinger. So Beau comes up to some lord on the street and asks him …', 'Beau Brummell:', '\\n“What are those things on your feet?”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis lord, of course, said, “They’re shoes.” Beau replied, he thought they were slippers.', 'Beau Brummell:', '\\n“Ugh. I thought they were slippers.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOoh, burn. Apparently this kind of insult humor went over very well and Beau roamed the streets of London, just dispensing clever insults and looking great. But Beau Brummell’s style was shockingly simple. He wore the same thing every single day — a white shirt, a dark jacket and tan pants. This look was the grandfather of the suit. And as conventional and stuffy as we may think of the suit today, Beau’s look was absolutely rebellious and unprecedented. For one thing, pants were pretty wild.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nThat issue of full-length cylinder of cloth, from crotch to floor was very unusual before Beau Brummell.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nUpperclassmen used to wear things that kind of looked like shorts, or maybe pedal pushers, with socks or stockings, just these bottoms that had multiple layers and parts to them. But Beau’s long shapely legs were accentuated by one uninterrupted piece of cloth. And Beau’s pants were really, really tight. Really tight. Beau required an assistant to get his pants on.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nThere is this fashion in wake of Beau Brummell of wearing punishingly tight, usually rather pale trousers. And indeed in an era when gentlemen did not wear undergarments of any sort for fear of what I believe is known as visible panty line.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThese early Beau Brummell pants made men look nearly naked, like they were Donald Duck-ing it, and this was intentional. It was inspired by this widespread obsession with Greco-Roman statuary.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nA fascination with the art of the ancients and, in particular, with sculpture.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThink of Jane Austen movies, right? Women around Beau Brummell’s time, curled their hair and pinned it back low and wore simple white gowns that made them look like statues of Greek goddesses.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nBut Greek and Roman male statues were almost invariably nude, or at least the ones that were considered of artistic import. And the origin to tailoring is born strangely in emulation of a sort of a nudity.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nTailoring was also an emulation of a military look. The suit jacket was derived from a riding outfit because Beau Brummell had served in the cavalry.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nThe monochrome, the simplicity has its allusion to military uniform, but also the idea of uniformity.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nHaving a uniform allows people to feel part of some larger cause, or part of a club. And so when Beau dressed in the same way, every single day, he amassed followers and they proudly called themselves “dandies”. Dandy didn’t mean how we think of it today. Then it meant edgy and minimal and extremely heterosexual. This manly cohort of men who slavishly followed Beau and dressed just like him.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nHe’s the center of a personality cult, really. The dandies of the West End, who began dressing in this strict pared-down, militaristic monochrome.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut bear in mind, Beau wasn’t dressing like his own country’s military. This is after all in the wake of the American Revolution. The Brits had fought and lost wearing their bright red coats with flashy gold buttons and long tails and fancy hats. The rebels, the victorious underdog colonists, were clad in muted blues and grays. Beau was dressing like the rebels.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nThe dress-down issue of Beau Brummell and his friend was sometimes taken as looking in support of, or in allusion, to American revolutionaries or French revolutionaries — very dressed down, very “man of the people” sort of look.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nBecause the trajectory of what created the suit and what drives fashion forward has always been the need for more democratic, simpler, dress down, relatable clothes.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is Derek Guy, one of my favorite fashion writers and editor for the website, “Put This On.”', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nIf the Brits didn’t take over the world and if Brummell had never lived, would we still have the suit without Brummell? I think undoubtedly, yes.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe Great Male Renunciation kicked off with Brummell, for sure.', '[THE GREAT MALE RENUNCIATION.]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut Brummell was channeling forces larger than himself and sentiments that were brewing long before he was born. Think about it. For centuries, Western monarchs and upper crest courtly people looked like goddamn aliens.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nElizabeth I dressed in a silhouette that almost made her look like an insect. She had a very, very narrow corset made out of whale bones. I mean, her garments were made out of wood, baleen, velvets, these kind of gauzy silks that would float around her head, looked like dry ice. And the idea of that dress at the time was to establish her position on the throne and the institution of monarchy itself.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis look was otherworldly. Intentionally saying, “I am not like you.”', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nIf you had at any point thought that this person was just a human being like you, then what justifies their rule over this entire kingdom?', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut things started to change after Queen Elizabeth, during the reign of Charles I.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nCharles I also had a very extravagant wardrobe. The difference at this time is that you had the rise of the printing press.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe printing press was around in Elizabethan times, but it really started to take off under Charles I, which meant royal subjects could, and did, print pamphlets making Charles look absolutely ridiculous in his big lacy collars. Basically, they made political cartoons.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nYeah. Political cartoons. Exactly. So what you think is an extravagant hat, they would show as a silly hat and it opened up the doors for other criticisms. When people start criticizing your clothes and they start criticizing your character and your spending habits…', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSure enough, Charles’s crazy close led Parliament to question all the other ways he had mismanaged his funds, which had turned out, were manifold.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nIt has to do with the growing ideas of liberalism at the time. How would these people be walking around wearing gold when the merchant class in that society was rising, gaining power and started questioning, why are you wearing all that stuff? What are you doing with my money?', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd in this way, men of wealth and power slowly realized it was best to keep their cards close to their vests, to not risk looking ridiculous or frivolous. In the rising tide of liberalism, power and wealth became about restraint and distance. And Brummell’s suit fulfilled this desire perfectly because it was democratic on its surface, but it quietly oozed wealth.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nIf you’re not going to rely on bling to establish your status and it’s to do with perfect detail. And the details were various.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the details were expensive. The suit required lawless tailoring, and you had to hire a valet to help you into your tight pants. And Beau started the trend of wearing a crisp white shirt under your jacket.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nThere’s an interesting signaling of wealth and privilege through clean white linen.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt was impossible to dry clothes in 18th century London without getting them covered in soot. To get white shirts and cravats truly clean, Beau had to send his laundry out to the countryside.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nSo the issue of just having clean white linen is a signifier of wealth and an attention to detail.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nMen were fascinated by Beau’s world of tiny details. And to understand his new way of dressing, actual crowds would gather at Beau’s house every morning to watch Beau get ready.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nSuch as a celebrity, people would come to watch him dress. He possibly had some sort of OCD issue in that he took several hours to dress. An hour or more of it naked in front of his assorted friends, including the Prince of Wales.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI cannot emphasize how crazy it was that the Prince of Wales was watching Beau Brummell in order to learn how to dress like a commoner, to learn to dress as though he did not care about dressing. The audience watched as Beau famously tied and re-tied his cravat over and over again, until it appeared as though he had just tied it briskly and effortlessly. As one of Beau’s dandy followers wrote, “My neckcloth cost me some hours of flurry to make it appear to be tied in a hurry,” because real men dress down and real men don’t care.', '[THE GREAT MALE RENUNCIATION.]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBeau’s dandyism had a grip on the London scene until 1812, when his insult comedy went a step too far.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nHe publicly insulted the Prince of Wales with the rather fabulous line to a mutual friend of theirs in front of the Prince regent, “Who’s your fat friend?”', 'Beau Brummell:', '\\n“Who’s your fat friend?”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe Prince of Wales was sensitive about his weight and this was pretty nasty, even for Beau. He fell out of favor with high society quickly. And then Britain went through a serious recession and Beau Brummell was in a lot of debt. And so he fled to France where he went mad and died of syphilis, which actually heightened the mythology of him as this tragic glamorous figure. Beau Brummell’s influence was profound. As Brummell so concisely said …', 'Beau Brummell:', '\\n“To be truly elegant, one should not be noticed.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is more or less the rule of law in menswear now, but the whole shift didn’t happen within Beau Brummell’s lifetime. As you know, from living in the world, some people follow trends, some people don’t. The Great Male Renunciation didn’t fully take hold until now nearly a century later with a figure who, in a lot of ways, was quite similar to Brummell, Oscar Wilde.', 'Ian Kelly:', '\\nOscar Wilde’s “Dorian Gray,” when it was first published in France, was reviewed and written off as a parable about Beau Brummell or a parable about syphilis.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOscar Wilde was obsessed with Beau Brummell. And like Beau Brummell, Oscar Wilde was also a witty man about London, frequenting the theater and banting about clever retorts, but he was emphatically unlike Brummell in the most important way. Oscar Wilde was a really flamboyant dresser.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nHe wore capes, these huge hats, velvet. I mean, he was dressed very extravagantly and he used, at the time, clothes as a way to build up his press and character. So when he would go on tours for plays, for example, he would dress up both onstage and in private life and the press would write about him, which of course helped advertise his plays.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOscar Wilde was suspected of being gay and then famously was put on trial for it. And he was sent to prison for two years for his sexuality. This threw a bucket of cold water on flamboyant dressing. There were real stakes now. If looking like Oscar Wilde could be taken for a crime, why risk it? Derek Guy argues that it was the trial of Oscar Wilde that in many ways sealed the fate of the Great Male Renunciation. Maybe it was best to not be noticed, to not care about clothes, so that what you wear doesn’t call attention to the way you spend your money or who you’re having sex with. Perhaps it was smart for men to dress in gray and blue and black, and to express themselves only in small details. This has been the rule in the West for so long. This mythology seems impossible to break out of.', 'Derek Guy:', '\\nI mean, there was a time on “Styleforum,” which is an online forum for men who are interested in clothing where as recently as the late-aughts/mid-aughts, where people would routinely post, “Is it okay for me to wear a pink shirt? Does it make me less manly?” That unfortunately, I think it’s part of this long shadow of Oscar Wilde’s trial and how men are very worried about what an interest in clothing means for how people perceive their manliness.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOf course, throughout the history of men’s fashion, there have been notable exceptions like the Peacock Revolution of the 1960s and 70s when men were in psychedelic patterns and chunky high heels. Not to mention the many varied and exciting versions of menswear that persist beyond Beau’s Western European model. And now there are these modern trailblazers like Billy Porter and Harry Styles who are really trying to have fun with clothes. Men are slowly learning to get more comfortable with self-expression, but it’s delicate, you know? Even at The Armory, that store or clubhouse for competitive menswear nerds, the clothes for sale there are all pretty subdued.', 'G. Bruce Boyer:', '\\n“It’s very traditional clothing, but there’s something very interesting about it all. Don’t you think?”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I do, but of course, part of me thinks, “Oh man, we should liberate men from this realm of small details and let them wear purple zoot suits.”', 'G. Bruce Boyer:', '\\n“Well, yeah. And that may be true. That may be true. I’m not sure I would even want to argue with that. I mean, I could go the other way with you and say, get away from the tyranny of fashion a little bit. I mean, come on you’re going to change your whole silhouette from one season to another? I mean, let’s even talk about the environment.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Touche.”', 'G. Bruce Boyer:', '\\n“I guess my answer to the subtlety would be, you got to train your eye a little bit. You’re a little blatant. You don’t really have to knock me out with the topless, backless red thing that you’re wearing. I get it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBruce is speaking hypothetically. I was not wearing a “topless, backless red thing.”', 'G. Bruce Boyer:', '\\n“But we could have a little subtlety in the dress too. So, I mean, I think that kind of thing works both ways, but I wouldn’t argue with you about it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“No, no, no. That’s a really good point.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBruce is right. A suit is timeless. You can really invest in one and wear it over and over again. And I love that, but I just cringe because suits have traditionally represented this version of macho, boring dressing that I’ve always resented. And I guess the thing is that so much of the power of the suit lies in who is wearing it and how well it fits them.', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“On one hand, yeah, of course it’s the garment of power. But on the other hand, it’s kind of like putting a suit on means that I can tap into that power too, if I want.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThat’s Rae Tuturo, who had to get dressed up for that wedding 10 years ago. And in their hunt for that special dress-up feeling, Rae ended up finding it in a suit. It’s kind of like when Dorothy realized she could go home all along, after a yellow brick road journey. Rae learned about the world of cut and fit and tiny details and has dedicated their life’s work to spreading this knowledge around.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Can suits be fun?”', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“Oh, they’re so fun.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nRae is now a partner at Bindle & Keep, a bespoke tailor in Brooklyn whose motto is, “Suits for every body.”', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“Hold on, let me grab a suit. I’ll be right back.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nRae is very good at their job and instantly plucked a suit off the rack that fit me perfectly.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“You think this will fit?”', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“Yes, that’ll be fine.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI was totally smitten.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Ooh. Ooh. So good.”', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“That’s wonderful.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Why does it fit? Why do I love it so much? What’s going on?”', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“Okay. First thing is, it fits your shoulders pretty well…”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOf course, a well-fitting suit is a privilege and a luxury, but there’s a reason the style has stuck around since Beau goddamn Brummell. If you get one that fits you, everyone can look great in a suit.', 'Rae Tuturo:', '\\n“You’re also liking it because the button is closer to the narrowest point on your torso. I mean, yeah. It’s proportional to you. I think that’s why you like it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nYeah. I liked it a lot. I just hope that we can move to a point in society where more people feel truly comfortable expressing themselves as loudly or as subtly as they would like to, which would be a big shift.

About how the diamond industry is exploitative and horrible.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nSo, blood diamonds or conflict diamonds, are diamonds that come out of war zones where warring groups have been fighting over the alluvial fields where the diamonds exist, in order to raise cash for their effort, which is violent.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nRachelle Bergstein is the author of “Brilliance and Fire: A Biography of Diamonds.”', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nAnd then when they were getting the diamonds, they were sending them into the marketplace and diamond companies, like De Beers and other traders, weren’t really asking questions about where they came from. And they could easily have been funding devastation and violence and horrible things, and no one was really thinking that much about it.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThat was until the late 90s, when a torrent of news and long-form reporting came out about conflict diamonds and how they were used to fund insurgencies and warlords. And all this attention eventually led to stricter protocols and tighter regulations within the diamond industry.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nAlmost 90% of diamond supply is produced by very large corporations, and they’re very heavily regulated, and they’re very transparent.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThat’s diamond industry analyst, Paul Zimnisky. And he says now these big diamond companies are not funding human rights abuses. Although there are still conflict diamonds out there.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nI think it represents a very, very, very small part of supply, but it can create a PR problem for the industry.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nListen, I’m not trying to give the diamond industry a pass here. The ethics of diamond mining are complicated. Like diamond mines might not be funding armies of child soldiers anymore, but in a lot of cases, the working conditions are not ideal, especially in countries without a lot of labor oversight, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I mean, mining is still a hard job. And just creating a mine at all, digging an unfathomably huge crater in the earth, that is environmentally devastating no matter how you slice it. But truly, diamonds aren’t that different from other extractive industries. A lot of materials around us have been mined and manufactured in questionable ways. And we don’t talk about them. Take, for example, cobalt.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nWe use cobalt in Teslas and we use it in our iPhones. And almost all of that’s produced in the Congo, and it’s the exact same issue that the diamond industry has with diamonds produced in the Congo.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDiamonds are held to a different standard.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nI think people think that a Tesla is providing enough good, where even if we’re providing some bad by creating demand for cobalt that comes out of the Congo, we’ll kind of let that one go. But since we don’t need diamonds, there’s zero room for any illicit goods.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWe don’t need diamonds, even though it doesn’t exactly feel that way. Diamonds are almost culturally mandatory. They’ve become almost a requirement if you want to get married. Which leads to the other big thing that made Courtney skeptical about diamonds.

How do you convince people that diamonds are accessible enough that every woman should have one, but also keep them, in the public imagination, so rare and glamorous and special that you don’t ruin it. And that’s what they’ve been working on forever.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDiamonds were rare, once. They were exceedingly rare. In the ancient world, diamonds were something only royalty could afford. And then suddenly in the late 19th century, there was a huge supply of them. Diamonds became an industry when a whole bunch of them were discovered in South Africa, on a property owned by brothers Diederik and Johannes De Beer. They were farmers.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nOkay. So, De Beers actually had nothing to do with the De Beers company.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nA massive diamond deposit was discovered on the De Beers’ property, which you’d think would be a blessing, but it was too much of a good thing. The land became overrun with international mining interests, and eventually the British government would force the De Beers to sell their property.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nThe De Beers’ mine turned out to be one of the most productive mines in the area.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe De Beers brothers could have never known that their name would get adopted by the foremost diamond company in the world, which was run by a man named Cecil Rhodes.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe was a sickly Englishman who followed his brother down to South Africa, down to the diamond rush. And there are funny pictures of him where he was like a dandy.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nVery much in the Beau Brummell way.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe’s among all of these people digging, and covered in dust, and carrying buckets. And he’s like sitting there on an overturned bucket in a white suit, glowering.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nMaybe it looked like he was glowering, but Cecil was scheming, on behalf of his motherland.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe felt this really strong internal drive to elevate the status of the United Kingdom. He felt like the Queen’s special envoy, even though she had not given him this job.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nCecil Rhodes is like the archetypal colonizer capitalist. You think of an old-timey European guy in a pith helmet, dressed from head to toe in khaki, with a mustache and a rifle at his hip, and that’s Cecil Rhodes. He started by buying up all the little mines in South Africa and consolidating them.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe grabbed uplands in Africa left and right, and colonized.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLike in modern Zimbabwe, formerly named Rhodesia after Cecil Rhodes.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe created the Rhodes scholarship to instruct and elevate young men who might follow out his mission as well.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nYeah, they should consider changing that name. Cecil Rhodes created a dynasty that grew and grew and grew, eventually buying up all the diamonds coming out of Russia and Australia, until the De Beers company had amassed more diamonds than had ever been thought possible. But come on, Rhodes didn’t want the public to know that.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nHe realized that in order to preserve the specialness of the diamond, you had to somehow control the output. You had to find a way to make them feel rare, even if they kind of weren’t anymore.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“So did that mean literally stockpiling them somewhere?”', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\n“It did.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen jewelers like Tiffany’s and Harry Winston and Cartier wanted to buy diamonds, they had to come to De Beers’s stockpile in London. Rhodes intentionally limited the supply to jack up the price. But even as he limited the supply, at the same time, his company was pushing public demand.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nThey were both a mining company and a marketing company.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDe Beers wasn’t allowed to advertise in the U.S. because they were a monopoly and America enforced antitrust laws back then. So as a workaround, De Beers decided to market the general idea of diamonds. After all, they mined most of the diamonds in the world anyway. If De Beers could get people to buy diamonds from whatever jeweler, they’d still be making money. And so, De Beers created the tradition of the diamond engagement ring. Because if you can’t sell diamonds for millions of dollars to royalty, you can sell diamonds for thousands of dollars to everyone. De Beers created this idea that every single couple must buy a diamond. Don’t get me wrong, wedding rings have been around a very long time, but diamond engagement rings are decidedly 20th century.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Is this the very first diamond ad?”', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\n“This is the first.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Oh my God, it’s so verbose.

However modest, your wife will never relinquish it to meet more affluent circumstances.’ That’s one of my favorite lines.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut then in 1948, De Beers launched what is arguably the most successful advertising campaign of the 20th century.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nA really incredible young copywriter named Frances Gerety. She worked for N. W. Ayer & Son, the advertising company. And Frances Gerety was given the task of coming up with a tagline for the ads.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLegend has it, Frances was really coming down to the wire the night before the tagline was due.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nShe stayed up all night and she couldn’t think of anything.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd then at 5am, she scribbled out, “A diamond is forever.”', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nAnd she came into the office and said, “Here’s what I’ve got.” And the senior copywriter gave her a side-eye and said, “Well, I don’t even think that’s grammatically correct.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut they had run out of time, so they just rolled with it.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nBut nobody, nobody foresaw what this tagline would become.', '[A DIAMOND IS FOREVER.]', '[A DIAMOND IS FOREVER.]', '[FOREVER.]', '[VISIT ADIAMONDISFOREVER.COM.]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd in this way, through engagement rings, De Beers convinced the world that diamonds are the rarest, truest, most valuable of the stones.', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nSo, aside from just generally convincing the customer that he should buy a diamond, or that she should demand a diamond, these ads also had the intention of saying these are the different cuts, this is how much they cost, things like that.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn their ads, and in pamphlets made for diamond sellers, De Beers informed the consumer about exactly how much money they should spend. And to a degree, this is still true for diamond engagement rings today. The person selling you the diamond is probably the one educating you about them.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nI mean, it’s high purchase price, there’s a lot of education involved, and it can be emotionally weighty. So we really want people, when they’re coming into the showroom, to feel relaxed, like they’re having fun.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBrilliant Earth is a diamond retailer with six showrooms around the U.S.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nI’m Kathryn Money, Vice President of Merchandising & Strategy at Brilliant Earth.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“So you are not the person who will come to greet a couple?”', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\n“Typically, no. Typically we have a jewelry specialist who’s working with a couple, and they’re having this one-on-one interaction, very focused on education, sitting down learning about the four C’s.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe four C’s is a shorthand created by De Beers to assess the rarity, and therefore value, of a diamond. It’s still in use today. The four C’s are: Cut.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nCut measures symmetry, polish, and proportion.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nColor.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nIt’s rated on a color scale from D, which is the most rare, and we will sell D through J.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nCarat.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nIt’s a measure of weight.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd clarity.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nClarity is determined under 10 times magnification by a trained gemologist, since most of the characteristics can’t be seen by the naked eye.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo, that’s the thing. If you can’t see it with the naked eye, if it’s not for aesthetics, then what is this for? Is a rare diamond, one that’s got good color or cut or clarity or carat, actually worth anything? Is it an asset? Is it like investing in a house or buying a piece of art?', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nIn fact, a diamond is much more like a car, where once you’ve taken it out of the lot, the value plummets.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nRachelle Bergstein’s answer is, most typical engagement diamonds aren’t worth much, unless the diamond is exceedingly special, like it is ridiculously preposterously big, or was cut by Harry Winston himself, or worn by Elizabeth Taylor. Those are worth a lot. But for the most part, the value of a diamond ring comes from who wore it, or touched it, or cut it. So unless you’re a celebrity…', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\nYou can’t flip a diamond. No one’s going to buy it back from you for the same price that you paid for it.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Why?”', 'Rachelle Bergstein:', '\\n“First of all, because you paid retail, and whoever you’re selling it back to is not going to pay that same retail markup. You’re going to take a loss. And second of all, if it’s just your run of the mill diamond engagement ring, with like a decent quality stone, they’re a dime a dozen.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd there are dozens more beautiful, brilliant diamonds being grown, every single day.', '[MUSIC]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThis is the other thing that feels freshly ridiculous about the myth of diamonds. How can we possibly think they are rare if you can grow them in a laboratory? Real diamonds, not knockoffs like cubic zirconia. Stones that are chemically identical.', 'Johnathan Levine-Miles:', '\\n“There are literally diamonds growing in that room, with this incessant hallucination-inducing hum that never stops.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Are you okay?”', 'Johnathan Levine-Miles:', '\\n“I’m fine.”', 'John Ciraldo:', '\\n“He’ll get over it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nJonathan Levine-Miles is the CEO of J2 Materials. John Ciraldo is the CTO of J2 Materials. And the fact that they’re named John and Jonathan is why they’re called J2. They grow and sell diamonds used for engagement rings, but that’s not why they got into the diamond business. They aren’t particularly interested in rings, they’re interested in the way diamonds can be used in future technology.', 'Johnathan Levine-Miles:', '\\nEvery time we sell a gemstone will inevitably help fund our diamond semiconductor research.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAs computers get more and more advanced, silicon might not be able to handle all their processing power, so diamond might become a good alternative material for computer chips. But this would require large plates of diamond that are perfectly clear and smooth. And John and Jonathan can’t sit around and wait for the Earth’s crust to produce that.', 'John Ciraldo:', '\\nWhich means it has to be grown in the lab, and so fundamentally that’s what we are trying to do here.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nJ2 Materials is in a strip mall in the suburbs of Chicago. It’s the kind of space that could just as easily be a dentist’s office, but it’s filled with reactors.', 'Johnathan Levine-Miles:', '\\nThe moment we turned on our first reactor when it was just the two of us, it was on 24/7. It shuts down just long enough to take out the diamonds, to clean the chamber and to start it up again. So we never shut down.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThese reactors look like rice cookers blown up to the size of washing machines. And normally we think of diamonds being created in the earth under a lot of pressure, but that’s not what’s happening here. An extremely simplified way to explain J2’s approach is that they’re taking small bits of carbon and growing them into full diamonds, almost in the same way you would grow a crop, where some turn out beautifully and some are duds. Like how some potatoes turn out hardy and strong, and others end up small, or lopsided, or heart-shaped.', 'John Ciraldo:', '\\nIt’s not a mass-produced thing. It is an art. It is a complicated thing.', 'Johnathan Levine-Miles:', '\\nI’ll probably put it a little more bluntly and say I think there’s, as a scientist of course, big caveat, there’s tremendous beauty in being able to take essentially cow farts and converting it into this technologically advanced yet beautiful material.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDiamonds have been synthesized in laboratories since 1950, but it used to be mostly for industrial uses, like for surgical knives or the knives used to cut aluminum for iPhones. It’s only very recently, like in the last couple of years, that laboratory-grown diamonds have started to look just as beautiful as the ones from the ground. Again, John and Jonathan didn’t set out to make engagement rings, but businesses like theirs have put the traditional diamond industry on edge.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\n“We’ve definitely seen significant growth in lab diamonds, so consumer acceptance, particularly among millennial consumers, has increased.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“And you sell those here?”', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\n“We do.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nKathryn Money of Brilliant Earth told me that lab-grown diamonds are sold almost interchangeably with mined diamonds. They are also assessed for rarity using the four C’s. The main difference is that they’re cheaper.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nAnd generally, consumers are drawn to lab-created diamonds because they’re beautiful, they’re responsible and they’re affordable.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nLab diamonds do use a lot of energy to keep the reactors humming, but it’s certainly less energy-intensive than digging a massive crater in the earth. Lab diamonds seem like an ethical, attainable option, especially to a generation of marriage-aged consumers who are broke and were raised in the 90s and 2000s, among whispers of blood diamonds.', '[MUSIC]', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe diamond industry is still reeling from that blood diamond reckoning over 20 years ago. Back then, De Beers was rightfully worried that people would boycott them and that the value of diamonds would plummet. So De Beers did something pretty drastic. They sold off a lot of their diamond reserve. They ended their own monopoly.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nBetween, I would say 2000 and 2004, De Beers liquidated their stockpile. You saw other companies emerge in the space, other diamond producers.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nDe Beers relinquished control of the global diamond supply. Consequently, they stopped advertising for all diamonds. De Beers went from being the only player in the industry, to one of several. And as a result, the mined diamond industry has slowed down a lot.', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nAlmost nobody’s exploring for diamonds, nobody’s building new diamond mines. So I think we actually could run into a situation where there’s a shortage of diamonds in the future.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nPaul argues that in 5 to 10 years, diamonds from the earth will become rare again. Because fewer mines are being cultivated, that scarcity that De Beers faked through their monopoly, might actually come true. So this means there’s two kinds of diamonds in the market right now: mined or natural diamonds, the kind that are getting rarer and more expensive, and lab-grown diamonds or man-made diamonds, which are proliferating and getting cheaper. The question is, can you tell the difference, and does it matter?', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\n“So, I think it’s important to make the distinction that manmade and natural diamonds can be distinguished with certainty.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“They can?”', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\n“Yeah. I mean, that’s interesting that you were doing all this work and you didn’t even realize that.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nListen Paul, I can’t see the difference between lab diamonds and natural diamonds. You can’t with the naked eye. And even with the official fancy equipment, some diamond sellers in the Diamond District, can’t tell the difference either.', 'Diamon Seller:', '\\nWhen you do a regular test, a diamond test, you see a diamond.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen I visited the Diamond District, I asked a couple of jewelers to look at a pair of lab-grown diamond earrings. I know for a fact that these earrings are lab-grown. They were sent to me by a lab-grown diamond company. And these two diamond sellers with booths across from each other, took turns testing each earring. And I am fairly certain that they both got it wrong.', 'Diamond Seller 1:', '\\n“What is yours doing?”', 'Diamond Seller 2:', '\\n“One, one.”', 'Diamond Seller 1:', '\\n“Yeah, mine was one, one also. That one’s actually a jackpot.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nHe said that one’s a jackpot, because both jewelers told me that one earring was “real,” and the other was lab-grown. One diamond seller offered to buy the “real” diamond for between $500 to $1,000.', 'Diamond Seller 1:', '\\n“$500 to $1000 is not-”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Nothing to sneeze at.”', 'Diamond Seller 1:', '\\n“Not chicken feed, right. And then the other one, you’d sell at a very low price.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“What’s a really low price for that one? Like $100? Really?”', 'Diamond Seller 1:', '\\n“It’s not fake, but it’s lab-grown.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI don’t know if you could hear that, but he said the lab-grown diamond would only be worth about $100. So one earring was supposedly worth 10 times more than the other. And again, I can’t emphasize enough that this pair of earrings came from the same laboratory. We value diamonds for their perceived worth so much more than anything about the way they actually look.', 'Diamond Seller:', '\\n“I sold an engagement ring for $2,000. The guy goes, ‘Could you write an $8,000 appraisal?’ I said, ‘I can’t do that, I’m not doing that.’ Because they want to put that in front of the girl, and say, I bought her an $8,000 ring.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I mean, it’s kind of smart.”', 'Diamond Seller:', '\\n“I would say if you’re going to start a relationship that way, it’s not going very long.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nNever mind, not a good idea. Don’t lie to your partner. But I guess it still just seems odd to talk about how much your proposal diamond costs if you can’t see the difference. I mean, it shouldn’t matter, right?', 'Paul Zimnisky:', '\\nAnd the question is, would proposing to someone with a $100 diamond, would that have the same impact? And this is something that’s not practical or not rational. So I don’t see a diamond as an investment in the material object, but it’s probably an investment in a commitment that you’re trying to portray.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nKathryn Money at Brilliant Earth gave me pretty much the same answer, that diamonds are valuable because they are tied to our deepest relationships.', 'Kathryn Money:', '\\nIt’s a representation of commitment, and love, and values.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAt the time I thought this answer was a bit of an evasive cop-out, but it’s not. This is how real, tangible value has been created and assigned, by De Beers, sure, and by all of us. By everyone, myself included, who wondered if Courtney and Sean were really engaged without a ring, without a diamond.', 'Courtney Riddle:', '\\n“I thought that I was better than that.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“But you’re not!”', 'Courtney Riddle:', '\\n“But I’m not. Look at this frigging sparkly thing.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Let me see it.

I give in, but we have to get them vintage.'”\", 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIf you really wanted to get a diamond and minimize your impact, a vintage diamond is the way to go. Compared to digging a massive hole in the earth, or a room full of humming reactors, your grandmother’s ring doesn’t emit any fresh carbon.', 'Courtney Riddle:', '\\nWe went to the Alameda flea market.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Courtney’s ring has not one, but two diamonds. And in the center is a ruby. Sean’s ring has a sapphire.”', 'Courtney Riddle:', '\\n“It ended up being ruby and sapphire. I ended up with ruby, which is the Pokémon game I’m playing. And Sean ended up with sapphire, which is the Pokémon game she’s playing.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt’s so cute. The rings still fit into their nerdy little world. And even though diamond engagement rings are built on a bedrock of BS-concocted tradition, all traditions get made up somehow, and they become more authentic as they get ossified in time.

Images of Queen Victoria’s white dress circulated throughout the colonies in a way few images could.', 'Heidi Rabben:', '\\nHer empire extended very long and very wide. And so the trend of wedding dresses beginning to be white, starting with her, really pervaded all over the world, following that moment.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt’s a simple origin story.

So just think about what you gravitate towards in terms of shape, fabric, and bits and pieces.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo sure. In some ways a wedding dress can be like other clothes you already have. But technically speaking, a wedding dress is like nothing else we have in our closets.

And the fundamentals of Couture design, come into play in wedding dresses in a way that they don’t with most other clothing.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIn a lot of ways, the typical wedding is a trip back to the times of Queen Victoria.

Into the different kinds of cutlery and flower arrangements and varieties of buttercream and fondant, learning correct posture and how to walk.', 'Rebecca Mead:', '\\nThere’s something incredibly retro, really.

Tradition is like a good luck charm.', 'Rebecca Mead:', '\\nIt’s a huge thing to get married. I mean, it’s very understandable that we want our personal choices to feel like they have some cultural value that extends beyond us.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the challenge of a wedding – from the dress to the menu, everything – is about finding that balance between tradition and individuality. So not only are you navigating your desires with the desires of everyone around you, you are also considering the desires of everyone who came before you.', 'Rebecca Mead:', '\\nWe want to be individual, at the same time we don’t want to be out there on our own.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd this balancing act, Rebecca Mead says, has its own significance. Only a few generations ago, getting married was a massive arguably traumatic life change. In one day, you would go from being a kid living in your parents’ house, to becoming a spouse of someone who you maybe didn’t know that well. And now when a lot of couples already live together, and know all there is to know about each other, we replicate that change, that major feeling of transition, in the act of planning the wedding.', 'Rebecca Mead:', '\\nThe wedding process substitutes for the shock that once you would have had, going from being a single person to being a married person. And I think in a way, it becomes a kind of useful thing to go through because you feel like there is something different happening to you.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nYou have gone through the process of planning this thing. You’ve learned about floral arrangements and venue rentals. You’ve gone through low-stakes simulations of trials and tribulations. And in this way, the ordeal of finding a wedding gown is particularly symbolic.', 'Rebecca Mead:', '\\nThere’s so much hope and promise that’s caught up in the buying of the dress. The gown has a totemic quality, doesn’t it? You fall in love with the dress as a way of falling in love with your spouse or replicating that experience of falling in love. And this is the one. You’ve found the one, just like you found the one to marry.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI was so ready to follow my colleague, Vivian, to a local dress salon, to watch that process unfold. Where she would try on gown after gown, dancing and shimmying in every look, while I sat on the couch, giving my thumbs up or thumbs down. Until Vivian comes out of the dressing room with an ethereal glow on her face. And everything seems to slow down. We don’t have to say a word. We just know she’s found the right one. The sales attendance clasp their hands over their mouths, and suddenly I’m crying, and Vivian is crying. We’re all crying. And in this moment, we all truly understand the gravity of what Vivian is about to do. And we burst out in applause. But I don’t have this moment on tape. It didn’t happen.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“No. Because I bought a dress. Literally… probably two days after we talked.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Inspired by our interview?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Um, a little-”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“It’s okay.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“No. A little bit. I think after we talked, I kind of wanted to get it done. So I went online. I just googled around.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nVivian showed me a picture of a long, white, off the shoulder dress. Very sleek. No lace or embellishment at all.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“It’s not poofy at all. It’s just kind of a sleek material.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“How much was your dress? If I can ask.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Yeah. No, you can totally. I’ll tell you. It was $100.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“No!”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“What?!”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“It was $100.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Is it nice?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“It’s nice. It’s not see-through. It might catch on fire in the sunlight. I haven’t tried it on in sunlight yet, but I like it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd in a weird way, Viv is following Elizabeth’s advice. She picked out a wedding dress the same way she picks out the other clothes in her wardrobe, she found a bargain.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“The Maxxinista in me wins again.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd it’s very much in Vivian’s minimal sleek style, but it’s also clearly a wedding dress. It’s white and it’s not something Viv could just wear a second time, without significant alterations.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I think this is definitely the kind of cut and fit that if I wanted to dye it, and wear it to something else, I totally could do that.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nIt turns out this is a common fantasy about wedding dresses.', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\nI get asked quite often, could I just shorten this dress later if I want to wear it again? Or could I dye it?', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nElizabeth Dye, the wedding dress designer.', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\nMy last name is Dye. So if you want to dye a wedding dress, and you google “dye wedding dress,” I come right up.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the answer to the question of, “should you dye your wedding dress?” is no.', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\nDon’t dye your wedding. The chances of you ruining it are 95%.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nEven if you send it out to get it dyed professionally, it’s tough. Because most garments are made of more than one textile, and they all take dyes differently. And often it comes out unevenly. Dye can also shrink garments. Just generally, it’s a rough thing to put your dress through.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I’m glad you told me that now, before I threw it in a bucket with some food color.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Oh yeah. No.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I have done that before, with shorts. It was a pair of jorts, that I turned into green jorts for Anime Expo because I was cosplaying”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Who are you?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I’ve got a lot of skeletons in my closet.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nSo if you can’t dye and rewear your dress, lots of brides are opting to do something unprecedented in the long history of wedding dresses. They will take this gown that they spent countless hours fretting over, and toss it.', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\nSo I’ve been making wedding dresses for a little over 15 years, which is crazy. It’s literally a new generation getting married now. There’s now sort of a new generation who grew up with “fast fashion” and just a really different relationship with clothes. There’s much more of a, “I want one this to look killer on Instagram, and then I’ll peace out.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere’s actually a whole trend of theatrically destroying the dress after the wedding. Like the bride will jump in the ocean in the dress, or get it covered in sand, or set it on fire — in order to take pictures of it.', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\n“Trash the dress.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Is that what the trend is called?”', 'Elizabeth Dye:', '\\n“Yes. I would say that the trash-the-dress thing is in keeping with sort of this new idea of “pure moment,” and then if you want to extend the moment, extend the moment by just destroying the thing, and making sure to get incredible photos of that, and then you’re done.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThere’s something kind of poetic about finding beauty in this destruction. “Trash-the-dress” is kind of an anti-ceremony in some ways. But I don’t know. Maybe instead of submerging it in an ocean or setting it on fire or attempting to dye it green, maybe the dress itself can function like a photograph. Maybe it’s worth keeping a wedding dress in your closet to remind you of that one day that you worked so hard for.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“I guess I could give it away, but it had some sentimental value to me.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAllison Chernow has held onto her wedding dress for 30 years.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“I don’t have much else left over from the wedding, other than the album and husband.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAlison is my mom. She has the album full of photos, the videos, the wedding ring. And what’s more, me and my sister. There’s a lot of evidence that she got married to my dad. But to her, the dress is different somehow.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“So I can look at this… Even looking at the photos, I sort of start thinking about the friends or the people who’ve died since my wedding, things like that. But this is the only object that really makes me think about the actual event and the ceremony. I can then remember how I felt in the dress, and how I felt that day. And I did feel really beautiful. I felt like that was my day. And people stood up when I walked down the aisle in that dress, and you felt very special. It was a moment.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI’m kind of in awe of people who decide to get married. Becoming legally bound to someone else seems so recklessly optimistic, it’s almost rebellious. And not just because there’s a 40% chance it won’t work out. Through the bubonic plague and the Great Depression and the coronavirus, people have found ways to get married, to have whatever version of a wedding they can. For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, weddings are easy to lampoon. I don’t need to go through the reasons why. But at the heart of this cliche, is something vulnerable. And at the heart of all this luxury is something necessary. It’s about having something to reach for, having something to feel excited about.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“It actually is a special day. I was kind of avoiding coming to terms with that it’s a special day, that people want to be happy for you. That wedding dress became an afterthought, after having experienced being around family and getting to live these three very distinct weddings.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nVivian had her weddings. The Italian get-away with a sleek off-the-shoulder dress.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“And it was perfect.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nThe courthouse in Los Angeles.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I got a 40-buck dress. So, that was fine.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd the big family gathering in New York.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Thin-strapped, floor-length, lacy. And I’ve seen a million girls with the same exact wedding dress, and it didn’t bother me.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd then suddenly all that energy and anxiety that went into the dresses went away. It was like Cinderella’s carriage turning back into a pumpkin. The dresses are just dresses.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I could let it go, I feel like.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Yeah?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“Yeah. I think so. I don’t know. I think we keep too much stuff. I don’t want to end up hoarding all these clothes.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Really? You’d be okay with not having any?”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“I haven’t felt the need to take out the wedding dresses, and look at them and feel them again, or put them on again.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Also, it just happened.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\n“It did just happen. It could change. 10 years from now, I might want to have one.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nOr even 30 years from now.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“I don’t even know if it would fit. So funny to try on.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Do you want to try it on?”', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“Yeah. I’ll try it on.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Yeah.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBecause clothes are records of the bodies we’ve lived in. We are like snakes who shed our skins and acquire new ones as we age.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“Oh, I remember this. The waist is so narrow.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut sometimes it’s nice, in the churn of our clothes, to let something last.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“I can’t get into it.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBecause the way you change and grow might be unexpected.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“It’s because your shoulders are broad.”', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“My shoulders got big.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nBut in this case…', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“Can I try it on?”', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“Yeah. Try.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nWhen I tried on my mom’s wedding dress…', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I don’t think it’ll button.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nAnd couldn’t get it off.', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\n“I shouldn’t have done this. I’m sorry.”', 'Avery Trufelman:', '\\nI had to rip the dress she’d been saving for three decades.', 'Allison Chernow:', '\\n“Girl, just go for it.

There are a lot of intense actions and discussions going on in the world today, many long overdue, and much of it is happening on social media… for better or worse. The story we have for you today is about how Instagram and architecture interact and feed back on each other. It was reported and produced before the COVID lockdown and before the protests over police brutality that have swept the country so if it feels like it’s from another era, it is, but as we witness social media platforms evolving to meet this moment, I think it’s worthwhile to report on how they evolved up to now. It’s also just a delightful piece and I think you’ll like it. So, here it is.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThis is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nInstagram has never really been my thing. I just don’t tend to use a camera when I’m out in the world. I just like to use my eyeballs. But I do like scrolling through Instagram occasionally, mainly because there’s a lot of good architecture on there. The app is awash in pictures of brutalist towers, graffitied walls, and elaborate staircases. And if you’re on Instagram there’s a decent chance you’ve seen a picture of one particular building… It’s called the Yardhouse.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe Yardhouse was designed by a London-based architecture collective Assemble.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s producer Emmett FitzGerald.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAssemble is kind of a big deal. They won the Turner Prize for visual art in 2015 for their work reconstructing derelict buildings in Liverpool. But the Yardhouse was the first building that they ever built. The designers had just moved into this new studio in Stratford, near where the 2012 Olympics were being held. It was on a street called Sugarhouse Lane. They wanted to build something on the empty yard out front, a collaborative workshop for designers and artists.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nThere was the idea that this Yardhouse could be the new model of affordable workspace.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Joe Halligan, one of the architects in Assemble.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSo that artists no longer have to live or work in cold warehouse spaces on the fringes, but they can be in these new warm, insulated buildings', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe problem was that they only had a short-term lease. The property, like a lot of properties in Stratford, was going to be redeveloped after the Olympics, and so they knew that they needed to build a cheap structure that could be disassembled.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSo knowing that we only had the lease for three years or something, it was like, how can you build a building as kind of affordably and efficiently as possible?', 'Roman Mars: The designers focused on things that made the building functional and inexpensive. They used a simple timber-framed structure and cheap mass-produced components.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nEverything’s bolted, screwed so that you can take it down again.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe building was like an urban barn, with high ceilings and lots of open workspace.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut the reason you may have seen this building has nothing to do with any of that. The Yardhouse isn’t Instagram-famous for its DIY design or its off-the-shelf affordability. No, it’s famous for one design decision that had very little to do with Assemble’s larger vision.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe architects knew they were going to have to look at this very functional building all day long, so they allowed themselves what seemed at the time like one small concession to beauty.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSo on the one facade that faced the yard, we knew we wanted to do something special that would kind of elevate it in some way.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nOne special wall.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nI guess it is a bit like an Italian church or something. You know, where the front facade is marble and it’s got this kind of incredible marquetry. But then the back is really just like bricks slapped together', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThey wanted to make their facade themselves, and so when they found a book on traditional handmade shingle work lying around the office, they took it as a sign. They started pouring cement shingles in the studio and mixing each batch with a different colored pigment. And after making thousands of tiles they ended up with this gradient of different colors', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“So together, when you see them on the facade, it becomes a bit like a lizard’s skin or something but pastel, so quite surreal.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“To me, it looks like the side of like a whimsical tropical fish.”', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“Yeah. Yeah. Fish scales. But definitely a tropical fish. It’s not something you would find in the channel, something around Britain. It’s definitely like Bahamas or something, I think.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nA beautiful tropical fish of a building tucked away in a post-industrial hinterland right next to a highway.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nWhich isn’t that friendly to kind of pedestrians, particularly tourists.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nBut if Joe thought that tourists weren’t going to find this hidden pastel wonderwall, he thought wrong.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nYou know, in the summertime, we would eat our lunch outside in the yard. And what we started to notice would be groups of people kind of wandering in and then getting their photograph taken in front of the building. In front of the wall, really.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSoon photos of the wall started circulating on Instagram with the hashtag #sugarhousestudios, and a geotag of the exact location of the Assemble offices.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nWhich only drove more people to the wall.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nIt was quite frequent. Maybe like 20 people every day would turn up. You kind of… they just become part of the furniture of what it is to work there. But really people were not interested in the work that we were doing.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThey weren’t interested in affordable workspace for the artists, or the fact that Assemble had managed to build something so cheap and yet functional.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThey were only interested in that beautiful facade.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nProfessional photo crews starting calling the office to try and “book the wall” and people were showing up from all over the world.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nDefinitely like lots and lots of international guests. It was an international community. (chuckles)', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAn international community of people, coming together to take more or less the same photo over and over again.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nIt was quite entertaining to watch them. People always do this jump. So it kind of looks like they’re floating within space against this backdrop.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nPeople would take photos of couples kissing, and babies crawling, and kids doing handstands in front of the wall.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSomeone brought their pug and they placed their pug there and take photos of their pug in front of this wall.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhat was happening with Assemble’s wall was an extreme version of a pretty common phenomenon. People take a photo of something cool out in the world — like a waterfall or a piece of graffiti or a sculpture — and other people see that photo and they say, “Hey, I want my own version of that picture!”', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“I take photos. You know, it’s like if I went to the pyramids, I’d definitely take a photo. I’m not comparing our wall to the pyramids!”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“Did you ever get an answer on kind of, like, how it went viral? Was there an instigating event or was it just the slow accretion of “likes”?”', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“I don’t know. I can’t pinpoint one particular blog or like this influencer took a photo of it or something, but-”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“Maybe it was the pug.”', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“Maybe it was the pug! Yeah, maybe it was the pug. Maybe it was the pug…”', 'Roman Mars: The architects in Assemble weren’t trying to lure people to the backlands of East London, but they accidentally designed the perfect Instagram fly trap — a wall that met all the criteria of what stands out on the app. Because Instagram is creating new rules about what kind of design looks good and what deserves our attention.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nVisuals that look good in Instagram are actually very simple.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is Alexandra Lange, architecture critic for Curbed and long-time friend of the show. She says that for an image to look good on a tiny screen in the palm of your hand, it has to have certain characteristics. Bold colors and patterns are good.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nIt can just be, you know, a colored wall or a patterned wall.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd not too many fiddly details.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nIt has to be relatively few elements, centering is good, a pop of color is good. And the lighting has to be good enough so that the colors stand out.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd, in general, flatter is better.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nThe thing is a good Instagram photo is really a pretty shallow photo. So walls and floors and pretty simple geometric patterns really look best on Instagram. If you go through the feed what pops, it’s this kind of flat patterning.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAlexandra Lange is particularly interested in patterned floors.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nI feel like the first cool floor that I noticed getting Instagrammed all the time was the blue and white tile floor in the intelligentsia Coffee in Silverlake which was by Bestor Architecture', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis hip LA coffee shop had these amazing geometric tiles.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nAnd they ran all the way across the floor and then up the front of the coffee bar and kind of over the lip. So it was basically almost like a carpet of tiles.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nA carpet of tiles that made the perfect background for an Instagram picture of a customer’s desert boots.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nAnd then suddenly it was like every new coffee bar had patterned tile.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nJust like Assemble, the Intelligentsia floor designer didn’t set out to make something for Instagram.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut in recent years designers have begun to intentionally design spaces that will look good on the app.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nLange says that hotel and restaurant interiors, in particular, have been designed to lure you with their Instagrammabilty.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nOne architect told me that it’s really important to have an Instagrammable bathroom. So like good lighting, a cool feature wall behind the mirror. People want to pop into the bathroom and take their selfie and sort of say, like, “I was here.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThese days clients often ask designers to create “Instagram moments,” which basically means some feature in a space that is just there so that people can take a photo with it.', 'Verda Alexander:', '\\nEvery time we’re asked to do it, we’re like, “Ugh… not another Instagram wall or whatever.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nVerda Alexander is the co-founder of O+A, an interior design firm in San Francisco that primarily works on office spaces for tech companies. And she says that even when clients aren’t demanding a designated selfie spot, platforms like Instagram are still impacting how designers do their work.', 'Verda Alexander:', '\\nSo we know that when we photograph projects, we need to have that first image, that first shot, that it’s going to draw people in, that’s going to get people excited, are gonna want people to pin it or look at it twice. Right? And so whether we do it consciously or subconsciously, we’re always designing for that Instagram moment', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd Instagram isn’t the only app that’s impacted the architecture and design world. Verda Alexander was a judge this past year at a few design competitions, and she says it felt like everyone was just copying what was cool on Pinterest.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich at the time was this very particular style of Italian postmodern design associated with the 80s architecture firm the Memphis group.', 'Verda Alexander:', '\\nSo I would be looking at these projects that all had pastel pink or round mirrors or narrow arched doorways like they were all the same details.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nShe says that when designers rely too heavily on platforms like Pinterest for inspiration, they can get stuck in this derivative loop.', 'Verda Alexander:', '\\nSnake eating its tail, right? They stay within this circle and don’t expand beyond that. And I guess that’s my fear.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat by focusing on digital trends designers lose track of livability, workability, climate — all things that you really can’t capture in a photograph.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nJoe Halligan from Assemble says that as a designer it’s impossible not to think about how something you make will be photographed later on.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nI think you have to be aware, slightly of that. That when you finish this building that you spent five years on the way, the way most people will view will be through the image.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nWhich raises tough questions.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nDo you then pander to that or do you still ensure the kind of main focus is on the person who visits the building and experiences it?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nIt’s not hard to imagine what the world would look like if everyone just went full-on with Instagram pandering. In some ways that world already exists. Just look at so-called Instagram playgrounds-', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nWhich are essentially stage sets made for taking the greatest concentration of amazing selfies in the shortest amount of time.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Museum of Ice Cream and the Color Factory aren’t really museums or factories. They’re spaces filled with colorful rooms and sculptures and ball pits—all of which seem to be designed with the purpose of being the backdrop of an iPhone picture.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nAnd I’ve written about those as kind of like the least fun playgrounds for grown-ups that you could possibly make.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYou aren’t really supposed to play in them at all, just take a few pictures and move on to the next room.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nIt reduces architecture to a photo-op. It turns architecture into basically a flat experience.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight now this flat, photo-op architecture feels pretty contained to the cafes and boutique hotels and the Instagram playgrounds, although it’s not hard to imagine it escaping from the Color Factory and slipping out into the broader city.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nOn the other hand, maybe our collective Instagram moment won’t last all that long. The kids these days are on TikTok or using Instagram more for its story function. We’re seeing less of the carefully composed selfies against the perfect backdrop and more short videos with a lot of jump cuts.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGet ready for TikTok architecture! Which actually sounds pretty delightful.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI honestly don’t even know what that would look like. But regardless of what happens next, Alexandra Lange doesn’t want us to get carried away with this narrative that Instagram has been bad for design.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nI feel like people are always trying to goad me into saying, like, Instagram is ruining architecture.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI would never do that! Ok, maybe I did that.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nAnd I just, I don’t want to say that because I can still feel that joy that I felt in Melbourne.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAlexandra was in Melbourne, Australia about ten years ago when Instagram was just getting going, and it turns out Melbourne is an underappreciated mecca for bizarre postmodern architecture.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nAnd I’m just completely wowed by these buildings because they’re spiky. They’re covered in neon. They’re just, they’re really kind of crazy. And they’re like, nothing I’ve ever seen before. And I suddenly have this overwhelming desire to share.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd so she posted picture after picture on twitter until someone was like…', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\n“Alexandra, this is very terrible twitter etiquette, like, take it to Instagram.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nLange had an Instagram account that she barely used, and so she started using it and posting all these pictures of buildings.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\n“The Australians are like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.’ But everyone else was like, ‘Wow! We don’t know what this is.’”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“What is this magical place, Melbourne?”', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\n“Exactly. And so I just realized that there is a super direct way for me to share my architectural experience, which is mostly joy, because I just love looking at new buildings. And Instagram was the perfect platform for that.“', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd it turns out, a lot of people love joyful pictures of buildings.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nMy son, who’s twelve, told me the only time he ever mentions me is when he wants to flex to his friends that his mother has 42,000 Instagram followers.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAlexandra Lange’s time using Instagram led her to believe that the app can have a positive effect on architecture. Sure you might get a few too many selfie walls, but the app can offer a window into the built world and encourage people to notice overlooked buildings.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nI feel like for a long time, architecture was really associated with specific capital cities. And so most people were only seeing a really limited slice of architecture. And I think something that I do, and a lot of other people do, is show the architecture is everywhere.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd even on the design end, Alexandra doesn’t think that those Instagram moments get in the way of good architecture .', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nThe truth is, you can simultaneously, you know, design a good building and make sure that it has a good Instagram moment in it. And those things are not mutually exclusive and they don’t… like one doesn’t undermine the other.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut there’s another reason why it probably isn’t accurate to say “Instagram is ruining architecture” because designing for the camera is really nothing new.', 'Keith Eggener:', '\\nCertainly in the 20th century from the 1920s and 30s onward, any ambitious architect has been conscious of and very attentive to the role of photography in conveying his or her work to a broader public', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThis is architectural historian Keith Eggener from the University of Oregon.', 'Keith Eggener:', '\\nArchitects like Neutra, like Le Corbusier, like Luis Barragán in Mexico, begin to use photography to convey certain things about their architecture that they wanted the larger public to see.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nLuis Barragán worked closely with one photographer in particular, a man named Armando Salas Portugal.', 'Keith Eggener:', '\\nI would go so far as to say there are very few major architects, in fact, I can’t really even think of another major architect whose reputation is so tightly bound up with the photographs of a single photographer.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe most famous photos of Barragán’s work are really a collaboration between two visual artists. Eggener doesn’t think that Barragán designed his buildings for the photographs.', 'Keith Eggener:', '\\nBut he was an architect who was supremely interested in the way things looked. Not just in fully dimensional lived experience, but also on a two-dimensional photographic surface.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhen Barragán won the Pritzker Prize for architecture in 1980, he wasn’t very well-known outside of Mexico. And many of his best buildings, the ones that Salas Portugal had photographed, had fallen into disrepair. But there were still beautiful photographs of them.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nKeith Eggener actually wrote to the members of the Pritzker jury to ask how they had picked Barragán.', 'Keith Eggener:', '\\nAnd most people politely wrote back and said, “Well, we can’t really talk about those deliberations.” But one member of the jury did write back and said, “Well, in fact, most of us had never actually seen any of Barragán buildings except in photographs.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nNot surprisingly, Luis Barragán’s buildings are really popular on Instagram. In fact, the Barragán house in Mexico City charges extra if you want to take photos on your tour, and people gladly pay the fee to get onto the roof.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nWhich has the really famous pink walls that people tend to want to photograph themselves with.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThe truth is that most people aren’t taking Alexandra Lange-style pictures that make you think about Barragán’s architecture in new ways. They want a selfie against one of those beautiful bright pink walls that really make a perfect selfie background. It’s understandable. And those selfies are consumed by thousands of people on an app, who may or may not have any idea about the real-world context. That picture of your friend in front of a pink wall could be at the Barragán house in Mexico City, or it could be in front of the bright pink wall at the Paul Smith’s store in Los Angeles.', 'Alexandra Lange:', '\\nYou can get almost the same photo. And, you know, Paul Smith has said he was thinking of Barragán pink when he painted that wall.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nPeople aren’t always posting a photo on Instagram because they’re interested in telling the world about some cool building. Sometimes they’re using some building to create a cool image. And it doesn’t necessarily even matter which building they use to do it. And as the number of images grows, they start to lose their connection with the physical world. Just look at what happened to the Assemble wall.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAs more and more people came to the offices, thousands of images of their colorful wall started to circulate online. And then the architects started noticing the cement tiles appearing as a stock photo like a generic wallpaper you might use for your desktop or a zoom background.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSo where you can’t see the building itself, but you just see a crop of these kind of colorful tiles.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then they noticed that stock photo was actually being printed onto stuff… laptop cases, rugs, picture frames.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nI remember being in Copenhagen and seeing someone sitting on the bus there with a phone cover with this building that, you know, we’d built in east London. And they have no idea. Well, I don’t think that I would have any idea of the context of where that image has come from. And that’s super weird. I think that’s like super weird.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then to make matters weirder, the wall that became a photo, became a wall again', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“What we saw then was a request from I think it was in a shopping mall in China and it was a request to kind of rebuild a part of the wall so the people within this shopping mall could get their photograph taken against this image. So it’s almost like they’ve seen the stock photo and they want to get their photo taken against the stock photo.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“Wait, so did they build it?”', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\n“Yeah, they built it. Yeah. It was built. And I think if you look on Instagram, you can then see people you can see photos of people against that wall.”', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI’ve seen these photos, and it’s just so strange to picture this journey from architecture to image, to architecture, to image. As for the real wall, the Yardhouse eventually had to come down when the lease ran out. That had always been the plan. They unscrewed the screws, unbolted the bolts, and packed up their building.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAssemble sold the structure. The Yardhouse is currently sitting in pieces in storage somewhere in London.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSo it still exists. But just in, um, just in parts', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nI asked Joe who they sold it to, but he said it was a secret.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nI don’t think I could tell you anyway. I don’t think I could say. We didn’t sell it to Instagram. We should have made that offer, I think', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nToday, Joe and the rest of his colleagues work out of a new studio in South London. Although they kept the name Sugarhouse Studios.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWhich may have been a mistake because to this day people continue to show up unannounced.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nAnd it’s really, you know, it’s quite sad in a way. When someone comes all the way and then they ring the doorbell and they say, “I’m outside. There’s three of us.” And, you know, “I’m in a wedding dress and we’ve got our photographer here. We just want to know where the wall is.” And you have to say, “Oh, unfortunately, we took that down two years ago.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAs for the old lot in East London, it looks very different now. Stratford was completely transformed by the Olympics. It’s a fancy neighborhood now with boutiques and wine bars. But the old photos are still tagged to the old location. So if you ever see someone wandering around Stratford, carrying a pug and looking confused at their phone, don’t worry. They’re probably just chasing a ghost geotag on the hunt for the most Instagrammable wall in the world.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe wall that became a photo, that became a wall, that became a photo became a blanket. That story, after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOkay, so I’m in the studio with Emmett FitzGerald, who reported that story. How are you doing?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nGood.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nGood. So this is where we often have these, like, little tangents in the story that don’t always make it into the story. And the coda is a good place to do them. So what do you have for us?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nA funny thing about this story for me, in general, is that this is such a side story for Assemble. They’re this really kind of impressive and cool group of architects, and as I was kind of reading more about them and learning about them, I could have done a bunch of stories about them. And this felt like kind of a funny disservice to them as an organization to do this thing about Instagram. But, you know, but it also is funny, I think, for them that, you know, no matter how many cool projects they do, it’s hard to imagine that they’re ever going to design something that gets seen by more people and appreciated in a lot of ways by more people, at least photographically than that wall. And I think that for the most part, Joe Halligan is okay with that.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nI wonder how many people know it’s building though. The whole wall, the building is. I guess that’s what’s a bit funny about it, isn’t it? It’s like it normally gets described as a wall. And I don’t think people know that it’s like affordable workspace, you know, which is a kind of pilot project for what could happen, of the legacy of the Olympics. You know, it could be deployed to allow artists to continue to work in the city. And I think it is kind of a shame that all of that stuff gets lost. It just becomes this kind of pretty candy thing. But I guess, you know, it’s nice that people like it.', 'Roman Mars: (laughs)', '\\nI like his attitude about that.', 'Emmett FitzGerald: (laughs)', '\\nIn general, I was very impressed with Joe’s attitude about this whole thing. Towards the end of our interview, Joe just kind of… in the studio in London I could tell he had pulled out his phone and was scrolling through and looking at some of these pictures. And it’s interesting because people… you know, the way Instagram works, that a lot of old things will get kind of resurfaced and reposted. So even though the wall in London is not up anywhere, the photos of it still kind of tend to resurface on Instagram as if it still was. So as we’re scrolling through, he was, you know, coming across all these different photos.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nYeah, they’re still posting about it, aren’t they? Mad. Completely mad. There’s a wedding here. Look at that. Unbelievable. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. It brings back memories of memories.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd, you know, most of these photos are kind of what we describe in the piece. It’s like either someone standing in front of the wall or jumping or holding a dog or their baby or just a lot of shots of the wall itself. But as Joe was scrolling through, we came across one that was kind of special.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nSee, look, there it is on a bedsheet. Oh, my God. Look. That’s so cool. That is the coolest one yet. You’ve got to feature that. This blanket was inspired by the much-photographed tiled wall at Sugarhouse Studios. Someone made a quilt of it. So it’s not that it’s a print. Someone’s actually bought different fabrics and kind of crocheted them together.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nAnd what I love… I mean, I just love, you can tell he’s just like a little bit enchanted by this.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, totally.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nIt’s like the best merch that we would ever be able to make.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nThat’s so cool. What is it? Could you show me a picture of it? Yeah. Here, take a look.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, it’s really nice. It’s not really a quilt. It’s like a crocheted blanket.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah, I think it’s more like a throw blanket on your bed. But it’s really beautiful and you can just tell, you know, how much work went into making that.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nTotally. Totally. So who made this?', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo this is someone named Gillian Roe who has the Instagram handle talesfromahappyhouse.', 'Joe Halligan:', '\\nTalesfromahappyhouse. She’s based in Hampshire and it looks like she finished the quilt in September this year. Maybe we’ll message her. And say that it looks fantastic.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo I’m not sure if Joe messaged her but I did.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s good.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nSo I DM’ed her on Instagram as she agreed to chat on the phone. And, you know, I called her up. I didn’t have a whole lot of questions, but I just, I wanted to let her know that the people who designed the wall, really thought her blanket was really cool.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\n“I was talking with one of the designers of the wall and we were scrolling through Instagram. The reason that I found you is that we were scrolling through Instagram together and we came across your blanket and he was kind of genuinely moved by how beautiful your blanket.”', 'Gillian Roe:', '\\n“Oh, that’s so nice! I’m really glad you told me that. Lovely.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, that’s sweet. Oh, I love that.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. She just seems like a really sweet person. And one thing that I figured out in talking to her was that she had never actually visited the wall. Like her experience of this wall was entirely Instagram, was only on Instagram.', 'Gillian Roe:', '\\n“Yeah. No, I’ve never been there. I’d like to go there. Spare time is limited and if I was going to go somewhere today, there would probably, if I’m really honest, I’d probably go there to meet a friend or maybe have a day out with my family. If I’m going with my family, then I’m not dragging them all to a wall to look at. We’re going to go to the Natural History Museum or something, aren’t we?”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat makes sense. That’s one of the things that’s kind of amazing. You could view this as decontextualization of the imagery of a piece of architecture in lots of different ways. And I think you could have kind of a cynical view of it that erasing the meaning of a wall or a building has some negative side effects. But in this case, and in probably lots of cases, I mean, this is a pattern that people experience just through Instagram and gave them joy. And in this case, you know, another piece of beautiful art was created. And so, it’s not like this is negative. This is just what it is.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nYeah. And I think that was the entire experience of reporting this piece, was kind of being like, is this bad? Is this good? Is this dystopian? Is this Utopia? I just kind of kept going back and forth on that. And, you know, in the end, I think it’s just like a mixed bag. It’s just weird. Like living in the Internet age and trying to interact in the digital and physical world at the same time is just like a weird, messy thing. But yeah, I think that this, this example was for me a really nice one, where it’s like here’s someone that found something online and made something real in the world out of it. Like she didn’t even have a relationship with the physical place.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah. And Joe and the Assemble team could feel mixed about some of the uses. But there’s really, truly nothing more amazing than being an artist who makes art that inspires other artists to create beautiful things. So, that’s just the greatest gift in the world.', 'Emmett FitzGerald:', '\\nRight, totally. I think that there’s nothing negative you could think about this blanket.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s so good. Well, thanks for this little addendum to the story.

When Chris Carlier moved from England to Japan in 2002, there was one thing that really stood out to him…', 'Chris Carlier:', '\\nI think a lot of Japanese people go about their day and they don’t really pay any attention to the mascots that are everywhere.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe Mascots. Real world, life-sized character costumes with sweaty actors inside.', 'Chris Carlier:', '\\nMost people ignore them. But I always found them really fascinating.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHere in the US, mascots are used to pump up crowds at sporting events or traumatize generations of children at Chuck E. Cheese, but in Japan it’s different. There are mascots for towns, aquariums, prisons…', 'Chris Carlier:', '\\nSometimes I’ll just go to the dentist and the dentist has their own mascot.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThere are mascots that tell people not to litter or remind them to be quiet on the train. Everything has a mascot and anything can be a mascot. There is an anthropomorphised bear mascot. There’s an anthropomorphized melon mascot. There’s an anthropomorphised bear whose head is made out of a melon. His name is Melon Kuma and he’s the mascot of a region known for both it’s bears and it’s melons. And so as Carlier adjusted to his new life in Tokyo, he started snapping photos of all these mascots he was coming across.', 'Chris Carlier:', '\\nI just realized one day I had like hundreds of pictures of mascots. So I started putting them online.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nCarlier’s hobby has since morphed into a wildly popular Twitter account called “Mondo Mascots.” And if you were to build a twitter account in a lab, you could not concoct a more “Vivian Le” set of content than this Twitter account.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah. It’s one of my favorite things on the internet.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s producer Vivian Le.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nTwitter has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions for the past few months so it’s a real treat to see a picture of a manatee with a pompadour made out of cabbage.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nUsually these costumed mascots are out interacting with the world, waving to tourists, and opening supermarkets, but like the rest of us, they recently had to spend a lot of time indoors in order to flatten the curve of the coronavirus.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nOne mascot was making quarantine workout videos for people stuck at home, another posted photo after photo of himself just staring blankly into space. But around mid-March, I saw something kind of odd and very meta happening on the Mondo Mascots twitter. Some of the more well-known mascots were adding these similar new flourishes on top of the regular mascot costumes. They were all wearing long, flowing blue wigs and colorful fish scales. The mascots were dressing up as the same creature', 'Chris Carlier:', '\\nI posted some mascots dressed as a kind of mermaid type creature with long hair and three legs and a beak.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was a mythical character called Amabié, a 174 year old monster that has recently become the unexpected hero of the COVID era in Japan.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nWhat’s going on in this tweet here is that local mascots are now dressing up as Amabié as a form of cosplay, a form of meta cosplay-', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThat’s Matt Alt, a writer and translator based in Tokyo.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nBecause there’s obviously somebody in these costumes who’s dressed up as the regional mascot who is now dressing up as Amabie. Does that make sense?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, not really!', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nThere’s so many layers. It’s like an onion, just peel the layers back.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nMatt wrote about Amabié for the New Yorker, and is also the co-author of a book called “Yōkai Attack: The Japanese Monster Survival Guide.” I spoke with him and his co-author Hiroko Yoda in order to peel back all of the oniony history layers of this Twitter moment. Matt and Hiroko explained to me that Amabié is a creature from Japanese folklore. What’s called a Yōkai.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nYōkai are monsters from Japanese folklore and they’ve been part of the oral storytelling tradition here in Japan since before Japan has been Japan. They’re basically like superstitions with personalities.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nYeah, the yōkai are characterization of natural phenomena or unexplained phenomena.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYōkai is a pretty broad term that includes everything from shape-shifting demons, to cuddly animal-like creatures, to spirited inanimate objects… and also ghosts. It’s kind of like trying to lump fairies, vampires, leprechauns, and an angry toaster into the same category.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYōkai are supernatural manifestations of the unknown. If you don’t know what made that noise that went bump in the night, you blame it on a yōkai. Occasionally they take the form of benevolent “guardian angels”, while some yōkai are completely innocuous. One of my favorites is the Azuki Arai which is a spirit that washes azuki beans… and that’s it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut more often than not they’re malevolent beings associated with a specific place. Kind of like regional ghosts or the troll that lives under a particular bridge.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nIf you go to this part of the river, you might be pulled underwater by a kappa, by river goblin. If you go to this part of the mountains, you might be spirited away by a tengu, which is like a big raven-like creature.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThe first yōkai stories were told in the 8th Century, but you can see the traces of yōkai that stem thousands of years back to Japan’s native religion called Shintoism.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nShintoism teaches you basically, appreciate the things surrounding you.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd the things surrounding you shouldn’t just be appreciated, but respected.', 'Izumi Hasegawa:', '\\nFor Shinto, we believe in the nature – like a forest, mountain – it has a spirit. So we respect the nature’s spirits.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Izumi Hasegawa, head priest at Shinto Shrine of Shusse Inari in America. Hasegawa says that Shinto is a religion that’s so tightly woven into the fabric of Japanese society that it’s difficult to separate where the religion ends and Japanese culture begins.', 'Izumi Hasegawa:', '\\nModern day Japanese people didn’t realize Shinto is our culture’s basis. I say it’s not religion. It’s more like a way of living in culture, tradition, custom.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHasegawa says that Shintoism is a belief system that venerates millions of deities that live all around us and impact daily life.', 'Izumi Hasegawa:', '\\nAfter the rain stops, and sun shines, and then plants grow so well…. Oh, maybe like the sun has some kind of spirit. Rain water had some kind of spirit. The growing, the productivity has some kind of the spirits. We should respect them.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThese Shinto “spirits” are called Kami and they reside within everything — from the trees, to the wind, even your iPhone.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nShintoism fosters the mindset that everything in the world is animated and has a spirit. Anything can become a character. EVERYTHING IS ALIVE.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nYou have this belief system in which nearly anything can be a receptacle for a deity or a soul. And many of those kami are actually personifications. That world view, that belief system of polytheism and animism is the soil from which yōkai emerged.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIn the beginning, tales of ‘spirit monsters’ varied drastically from region to region and were passed on as verbal stories with no real visual form attached. A kappa water goblin from the south might be described totally differently from a kappa from the north. That is, until the Edo Period.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThe Edo Period, which took place between 1603-1868, was a time of political stability and economic growth for Japan, and during this time the publishing industry started really taking off.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nIn the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in Japan, one of the most popular forms of book was the encyclopedia. And encyclopedias are what? Full of data and information. Well, around 1776, a artist named Toriyama Sekien came around and he published a parody encyclopedia that wasn’t full of facts at all.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt was an encyclopedia of yōkai. Sekien created a catalogue that gave each yōkai a name, a description, and an illustrated image associated with it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd this was the moment that the modern concept of yōkai emerged, Seckien’s books were some of the first mass-produced reference images of yōkai. The entire nation was literally on the same page about who these monsters were and what they looked like.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nBefore Toriyama Sekien’s book came out, the yōkai were only drawn on Japanese scrolls. The people in general cannot really see them.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nIt essentially cemented the image of a lot of yōkai in place. And those are the images that we know today.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBy creating an illustrated index of them, Sekien took all these local legends and consolidated them into a piece of national pop culture. In part, because of Sekien’s encyclopedia, stories about yōkai flourished during the Edo Period, both as entertainment and as a way of explaining the many unknowns of the world, including highly infectious diseases caused by invisible microorganisms.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nYou know, today we have science to explain… like plague for example. But back in time, there’s not that much information about medical. And so it’s very unknown. And in that way, that’s when the yōkai come into play.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd a plague was actually where the yōkai known as Amabié specifically came into play. Throughout the 19th century cholera epidemics were sweeping the world, and Japan was hit especially hard. Wave after wave of outbreaks devastated the country over the course of several decades. And at the same time, very little was known about the disease and how to fight it.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAccording to an actual newspaper story at the time, Amabié was spotted off the coast of Southwestern Japan in 1846.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nFor several nights in a row, villagers could see a mysterious light radiating off the coast towards the sea. One night, an officer was sent to investigate the source.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHe followed the light towards the water until he was greeted by a strange looking creature who appeared out of the sea. It had the beak of a bird, long locks of human-like hair, a body covered in scales, and three legs with webbed feet, kind of like a cross between a mermaid and a duck.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nAnd it declared that its name was Amabié. It said that there would be a abundant harvest. And then it said, [JAPANESE LANGUAGE] if plague should ever ravage these lands again, [JAPANESE LANGUAGE] show an image of me to the people.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd then, it was gone.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nIt appeared in a Japanese newspaper of the era as a little article, and it was accompanied by a very charmingly crude drawing that looks almost like a child might have done it.', 'Vivian Le: Because of that story, Amabié became a talisman against plague in Japan. People would draw a picture of it and display it for others to see so that Amabié would protect the world from harm.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nMythical creatures like Amabié played an important societal role within Japan in the 1800s. But by the turn of the 20th century, Japan’s relationship with its Yōkai began to shift.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nLargely because of one man in particular. A philosopher named Inoue Enryo.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nSo Inoue Enryo is known as a “Doctor Yōkai.” And if you see the word Dr. Yōkai, you know, sounds like he is really into yōkai.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut it was the exact opposite—he made it his mission to displace yōkai from the Japanese psyche for good. Inoue was born right at the beginning of the Meiji Restoration which was a moment when Japan began opening up to the rest of the world after hundreds of years of isolation. But as the country began opening up, leaders wanted to be able to compete with Western countries in terms of science, technology, and military power.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nSo in his eyes and some politicians, Japan is very behind from the west and they have to catch up the west.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nInoue saw yōkai as a crutch holding back the nation. If Japan was going to become a world power, it needed to actively embrace modern science and technology. He felt that so as long as people clung to yōkai and superstition to explain away the unknown, Japan would never reach its full potential.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nHe went around the country finding examples of superstitions or places where people said a spirit was responsible for things or urban legends and basically debunked them.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nInoue became a sort of ghostbuster. He created his own area of research called “yōkaigaku” or “Yōkai Studies” and would basically go from town to town being “that one guy” at magic shows pointing out all of the trap doors and mirrors in the illusions. He used scientific experimentation to explain away the natural phenomena that yōkai were previously attributed to. But it didn’t just stop at yōkai, a lot of local customs and traditions were quashed during this time.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nI think that movement went too far. Our local beliefs are totally killed by the modernization, the local deities, or the Buddhist deities, and small temples are shut down.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nInoue wasn’t necessarily some crotchety old hater of all things wondrous. If anything, he was fascinated by the great mysteries of life, what he called true mysteries. They were the universal conundrums that we may never find an answer to like what happens to us when we die or what’s the meaning of life. But he was a Buddhist and a scholar, and he just didn’t think monsters fell into that category.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nHe didn’t deny all possibility of mystery.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThis is Michael Dylan Foster, professor of Japanese and Japanese folklore at UC Davis.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nHe was basically saying that most of the mysteries that we see, most of the Yōkai, can be explained away. But there are those that can’t be explained away and those are what we have to find.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nHe tried to come up with solutions or some kind of answers for unexplainable things like, you know, like Mulder / X Files, like “truth is out there.” You know what I mean?! He’s trying to find it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut because of Inoue and his work, people became less and less interested in stories of yōkai. They were no longer needed to understand the world.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nBut they didn’t completely disappear, because they provided something that modern science couldn’t. Yōkai filled a different, more psychological need for comfort.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nThere’s an expression in Japanese [HAN SHIN HAN GI] which is translated as half belief, half doubt. And I think that’s how in our sort of daily interactions with so many things in the world, we actually approach them. People think of a yōkai, a monster creature, a supernatural explanation of something as being irrational in some ways. But I think we have to sort of turn that around and realize that it really is a very rational way to think about things.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSometimes a ghost story can make the unknown feel less chaotic.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nImagining that it’s a monster—putting a form and a face and sometimes a name and various attributes to something gives you a sense of control over it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd even though Inoue earned the reputation as a ‘yōkai killer,’ it’s actually thanks to him that we know as much as we do about yōkai. Inoue was an incredibly thorough researcher and kept meticulous notes. His work has been really helpful for people who study folklore.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nEven though he’s famous for a debunker, I guess, of paranormal activity, but because he left so much data to look for the absolute truth, his data is very useful for folklorists today.', '[MUSIC]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nFor years yōkai existed in this nebulous space. Their stories weren’t entirely forgotten, but they were suppressed in the name of rationality and progress. It wasn’t until after WWII that yōkai crept out of the shadows and back into the public imagination.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nIn the postwar era, when Japan is finally recovering from the horrors of war, a consumer economy starts up again, a publishing industry starts up again, and there’s a huge hunger for entertainment. Manga – comic books, cheap comic books – become one of the main forms of entertainment.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd just as it took basically one man to exorcise yōkai from Japan’s collective consciousness, it only took one man to revive them. An artist actually.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nThe manga artist, Mizuki Shigeru brought it back. He’s very known by the animation called GeGeGe no Kitaro.', '[GEGEGE NO KITARO THEME]', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIn the 1950s, an artist and animator named Mizuki Shigeru released a manga that was adapted into a popular animation series called GeGeGe no Kitaro. It’s charming… in a deeply unsettling way that will haunt your dreams. The story centers on a one-eyed ghost boy named Kitaro who keeps the peace between the world of yōkai and the world of mortals. Mizuki was also a folklorist and he used this series as a platform to propel yōkai back into the Japanese mainstream.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nWhen I was a kid, I saw the animation and I grew up with it. It was huge and popular. So a lot of characters are created by him. But also many of yōkai are based on the old yōkai. He brought them back.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSince Mizuki’s reintroduction, yōkai have been a constant presence in Japanese pop culture. There’s been reboot after reboot of Kitaro over the decades, as well as incredibly popular games like Yōkai Watch which is introducing newer generations to yōkai.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAnd these monsters are all over the cultural exports that we Americans flip out over. You can see the dark whimsical undercurrents of yōkai in the work of Haruki Murakami or the animation of Hayao Miyazaki.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nNot to mention one of the biggest franchises in the world, Pokemon. There’s a certain pokemon that is inspired by a yōkai called Sōgen-bi which is depicted as a ghoulish floating head engulfed in a fireball. Let’s see if you can guess…', '[WHO’S THAT POKEMON!!?……….]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo clue.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nCome on, Roman.', '[IT’S GASTLY!!]', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nMizuki Shigeru, the man who revived yōkai in the 20th Century, was concerned about whether yōkai could survive in modern society. They’re products of an older era – one that relied on faith and superstition rather than science and technology. In an interview before his death, Mizuki says that in the bright lights of modern Japan, yōkai can’t flourish like they once did.', '[CLIP OF MIZUKI SHIGERU]', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nNow today in the modern era, it’s lighter everywhere. So bright. You can see everything. He’s saying that modernization make yōkai “difficult to live.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut despite the bright lights and modernization, yōkai are still thriving.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nI don’t think yōkai ever go away.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nFoster says that yōkai have been a part of popular imagination, and will remain a part of popular imagination in one form or another.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nThe need for explaining mystery never disappears. Once we scientifically explain it, it just moves on to something further along, something deeper. And there’s still that mystery needing to be explained. So in other words, Yōkai themselves will never go away.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nThey may not take the same form or address the same fears as they did hundreds of years ago, but yōkai will always adapt to inhabit the world around them. And you can see this in the character culture of Japan', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nA lot of times foreigners come here and they see this and they’re just blown away by the sheer amount of super cute characters running around on the streets of Japan and the forms of illustrations and signs and things like that. And they mistake it for it being kind of infantile or childish. But in reality, the roots of that character and mascot culture can be found in the yōkai who are sort of mascots for a bygone era.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nWhich brings us back to that plague-fighting Edo Period mascot, Amabié.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nUntil recently Amabié was actually not a well-known yōkai in Japan.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\nBut then suddenly, in late February, just as COVID-19 was starting to sweep the world in earnest, a Japanese artist on Twitter kind of resurrected Amabié and he posted an image of the original newspaper article and then he posted an illustration that he had made of Amabié saying, “Amabié, I’m following what you said. I’m sharing your image. I hope this helps.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThousands of people on twitter from all over the world started posting their own renditions of Amabié with the hashtag #AmabieChallenge.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nI’ve seen hand-drawn sketches of Amabié, watercolors of Amabié, wildly inappropriate humanoid female forms of Amabié… all with the same luxurious flowing locks, scales, and three legs.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nOne thing that we can do is latch on to this idea of the Amabié as a kind of counter attack to the virus.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHere’s Foster again.', 'Michael Dylan Foster:', '\\nMost people would say they don’t really believe in them, but the idea that there is the possibility that something could exist, that potential for there being something beyond our current way of explaining the world I think is a very attractive thing to a lot of people.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\nIf you’re facing something unknown or something that you cannot… you don’t understand or something uncontrollable. It’s just, it’s chaos. Obviously, your drawing of Amabié is not gonna give you hardcore solutions or vaccine or anything like that but yōkai, it gives you a way – one of the ways – to control things, to give you peace of mind.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo if you’re feeling anxious about the pandemic these days, go ahead and draw a picture of\\xa0 Amabié and put in your window for everyone to see. It is not going to stop the virus. I cannot stress this enough. But why not have a yōkai around the house? You might just feel a little bit better… What also might make you feel better and would make the whole world better would be if you wore a mask. I also can’t stress this enough! Wear a mask. Draw Amabié on it if you want to but wear a mask. Thanks.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSpeaking of Japanese character culture, did you know that Hello Kitty isn’t a cat? I certainly didn’t. Vivian comes back to explain after this.', '[BREAK]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nSo I’m talking with Vivian Le again. How are you doing?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nI’m good, Roman. How are you?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nExcellent. In your closet. Doing good.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, I’m in my quarantine studio surrounded by like… I didn’t realize how many pairs of overalls I have and rompers. So this is kind of embarrassing.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, you should not be embarrassed. Rompers. One piece of clothing is extremely acceptable in the new era.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s very efficient. So I really appreciate that. So Roman, how familiar are you with Hello Kitty? I’m guessing you didn’t grow up collecting a lot of, like, stationery and coin purses, but I don’t want to assume.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nNo, I don’t think I became familiar until my 20s, actually. Like, I didn’t quite catch on to it at the time. You know, I’m somewhat familiar, but that’s about it.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nHello Kitty is one of those characters that is like a huge cultural export from Japan so even if you’re not a fan, you would still, you know, recognize the character.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nAbsolutely.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nShe kind of came up in conversation during my interview with Matt Alt and Hiroko Yoda. Matt told me about this big news story from a few years back that I had completely forgotten about.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\n“I don’t know if you remember, like a couple of years ago, there was a big brouhaha when it was announced that Hello Kitty wasn’t a cat.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nShe’s clearly a cat. She has like cat ears, like her name is Kitty. Like, could she…? That’s a cat.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s incredibly misleading. But back in 2014, there was a retrospective exhibit on Hello Kitty at the Japanese American National Museum. And the curator was an anthropologist named Christine Yano. And she’d written a book about Hello Kitty. So she was doing an interview with the L.A. Times, which was covering the exhibition. And Yanno said that she was writing up some texts and she had referred to Hello Kitty as a “cat” and she said she was firmly corrected by Sanrio and was told that Hello Kitty is not a cat. She was a girl.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nLike, she’s supposed to be a human girl, not a cat-girl, but a human girl?', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSee, that is actually unclear if she’s like a human girl or like a young female _______ (blank). But Yano says that what Sanrio told her was, “She’s a cartoon character. She’s a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat.” She is never depicted on all fours. She walks and it’s like a two-legged creature. And then, if you go to the Sanrio website, they have even more details about her background. Apparently her name is Hello Kitty White. She is the daughter of George and Mary White. She has a boyfriend named Daniel Starr who wants to be a cameraman when he grows up. And she also has a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nOh, so it is Charmmy Kitty a cat. Like is Charmmy Kitty her cat.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nFrom what I can tell, she’s a cat. She looks exactly like Hello Kitty. But she walks on all fours. So I guess technically she’s a cat.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nWow. So, okay. So I’m trying to think of other cartoon characters. So like if you’re thinking of Donald Duck, okay? I’m aware that Donald Duck is not like a real duck, that he wears clothes and smoke cigars. That’s not a real duck. But I wouldn’t say he’s not a duck. You know what I mean? Like, that’s a weird choice.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nIt’s a very clear distinction.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nRight.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo it’s kind of funny cause Yano casually slipped this “Hello Kitty is not a cat” thing into an interview with the L.A. Times and people just didn’t take it very well.', '[SHE MAY LOOK LIKE A FRIENDLY FELINE, BUT THIS WEEK, FANS OF HELLO KITTY WE’RE TOLD THE SHOCKING TRUTH.]', '[I CAN SEE THE CAT. IN MY HEART, SHE’LL BE A CAT FOREVER. I’M A CAT LOVER. SHE’S LIKE THE AMBASSADOR OF CATS.]', '[ALRIGHT, YOU’RE IN HELLO KITTY, RIGHT?]', '\\n[YES. YES, ABSOLUTELY.]', '\\n[WERE YOU APPALLED TO HEAR THIS? WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?]', '\\n[I ACTUALLY WAS APPALLED.]', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI think he’s leading the witness, Your Honor. [LAUGHTER]', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut like even the Washington Post headline was, “Hello Kitty is not a cat. Everything is a lie.” And even Josh Groban had an opinion on the matter and tweeted, “Hello Kitty is a cat. She has whiskers and a cat nose. Girls don’t look like that. Stop this nonsense.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nIt seems that people just can’t fathom a universe where Hello Kitty is not a cat.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nActually, after this news broke out, a bunch of reporters ended up reaching out directly to Sanrio. And the company actually, you know, revised their statement and they said maybe it was too far to say she was not a cat. But they clarified that Hello Kitty is a personification done in the motif of a cat, which I think may have still been confusing to a lot of people.', '[BUT IF YOU READ REALLY CAREFULLY, WHAT SANRIO IS SAYING IS SHE’S A PERSONIFICATION OF A CAT. SHE’S ACTUALLY A LITTLE GIRL. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WESTERNERS COULDN’T WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND AT ALL.]', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nAnd that’s not to say that all Japanese people immediately understood that Hello Kitty is not a cat. There there’s still a lot of confused Japanese people. But the word that Sanrio used to describe her is that she’s a Gijinka, which translates to anthropomorphization. And you see this in those costumed mascots on the streets of Japan but also everywhere in the country. Like there’s an anthropomorphized strawberry on the pack of fruit or like a cartoon phone in the manual of your phone. And it’s just something that’s incredibly present in Japan in a way that it isn’t here in the West.', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\n“I started using Gijinka to explain the culture difference. Especially to me, it’s like America versus Japan. So it’s kind of natural. It’s just there, like air, to me.”', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo I think that when Sanrio was trying to explain why Hello Kitty is not necessarily a cat, they were working off this understanding of, you know, anthropomorphism that you could look at a cartoon cat and not necessarily think of it as a cat per se.', 'Matt Alt:', '\\n“Anthropomorphism really runs through Japanese culture and that, I think, is the thread that connects things most of all.”', 'Hiroko Yoda:', '\\n“Yeah, It’s just… You don’t see it. You don’t see it outside Japan. It’s actually a unique thing of Japan. It’s so natural to us.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nHmm. So I guess the answer is that Hello Kitty is not a cat, but is also, you know, not not a cat.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nYeah, she lives somewhere on the spectrum of cat. But you’re a fan of “The Mountain Goats,” right?', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nYeah, sure. Yeah.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nSo if you’re, like, confused, you could just take a cue from them because they tweeted, “Hello Kitty is not a cat. Hello Kitty is a God. You exist only at Hello Kitty’s pleasure. Crawl like drugged roaches before her splendor.”', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nThat’s a very John Darnielle take. [LAUGHTER] Oh, that’s so good. Well, I feel like I understand this a whole lot more in some way.', 'Vivian Le:', '\\nBut also like a lot less.', 'Roman Mars:', '\\nI could say that I both understand it and don’t understand it.
