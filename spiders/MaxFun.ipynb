As an up and coming singer-songwriter, she played house shows, cafes, slept on couches and floors. She also started her own record label, Righteous Babe. She released her own music through it, as well as work from Andrew Bird, Arto Lindsay, and Sara Lee. Around Ani DiFranco, there’s a huge, passionate fanbase. She sold millions of records, hit a bunch of Top 100 charts, won awards and acclaim from critics. But maybe more than any other singer, Ani DiFranco is defined by her independence. When we talked in 2017, though, she’d just released an album that departed from that a bit. She collaborated with a big, diverse roster of artists. Justin Vernon from Bon Iver, Maceo Parker, Gail Ann Dorsey. ',\n",

And one of the things that you were talking about was how much of yourself you lay out onstage. And the way that you relate to audiences, onstage. And essentially, you said that the thing that kind of powered you through a performance was looking into the eyes of the people for whom you were performing. And I think that is a fair description of, you know, what you were doing on your records, too. Like, you were really looking into the eyes of your audience in a way that few musical artists are… are interested in or willing to, whatever the case may be, do.

I feel like I sort of took a page from my mother’s book when I was young. And she was a very engaging person and a strong feminist and a, you know, an architect when there were no women architects. And my father was very gentle. He was very passive. He was very kind and quiet, and I feel, as I get older, I feel like I am on this sort of trajectory from my mother to my father. And now, I like to engage with people in a more gentle way. You know? And I think I—I mean, I hope that after empowering my tribe and connecting, you know, and finding my chosen family that now my new challenge is building more bridges. You know.

As I was, you know, making the recordings I was just dreaming and scheming like, “Ooh.” You know, usually on many a record I would have done—what was about to up come there in the track was a chorus of Justin’s voices that he added to the choruses of the songs, of that song. And I just—I said, “Can you be a string section with your voice?” Question mark. “That’s my only—that’s it. That’s all I’m telling you.” And normally I would do that with myself, you know. My own—my little bullet mic, you know, choruses have been on a lot of records. But once again, this time out I was like, “Maybe I should just make a few calls.

Finally got into a band in high school and that was the first time I was able to like talk to other kids. I had this—finally had this like shared language. ‘Cause I didn’t—I was super tomboy.

But I remember a friend of mine turning to me one day, saying, “Stop calling yourself an asshole. Because you’re not.” And it had become such a habit to just sort of say that in a toss-off kind of way? And… I was like, “Oh. Yeah.” And so… the fail is kind of getting trapped in that cycle of a negative language? And it is hard. This is all hard and impossible and we’re all like… fucking up. A lot. We’re also succeeding. A lot. Right? Let’s done, like—don’t let the secret out. Keep that secret, right? Stop apologizing for that stuff! Just—I don’t know. Maybe. Y’know, I—yeah.',\n",

She’s appeared on countless TV shows. She had her own movie. She’s performed live at theaters and amusement parks for years. This year’s Halloween’s gonna be very different. Instead of live shows, she’s doing virtual Halloween celebrations, recording music, and signing merch for fans. But she is, as always, Halloween’s most vocal champion. When Cassandra and I spoke in 2017, we kicked things off with a classic clip from the ‘80s. She’d just been hired to host the spooky B movie TV show, ',\n",

You know, white lips and big black circles around the eyes.” So, that’s what he drew up. I have that picture still. I just put it in my book that came out recently. And they hated it. They just took one look at it and said, “No! Are you kidding?! You have to have all black! You have to—you have to have black hair! Black clothes!” It was like, ugh. God. So typical. You know? Like, oh, what are we gonna do to update that look so I don’t look like I’m ripping off either of them? But when your parameters are all black with black hair, what do you do, you know? And you’re supposed to be some kind of a vampire or something. So, my friend Robert and I came up with ideas to make it look kind of hip and ‘80s. Kind of punk, you know. There was no goth—we had—or we had never heard of goth movement at that time. If there was, it may have been over in England, but I’d never heard of it. So, we tried to do a little, you know, heavy metal. Little punk stuff here and there. Jagged edges, some safety pins, some bracelet—leather bracelets with studs on them.

It’s hard to think about the first time I heard the “Monster Mash”, because I feel that the “Monster Mash” is one of those songs that has always been with us, you know? I think it’s a song that I was born knowing. Like the national anthem. It’s just—it’s just—it’s in your bloodstream. It’s a part of the culture. I do know that the first time I paid a lot of attention to the “Monster Mash” was when I was in a band, in high school, and we were hired to play a Halloween party. And the very first thought that we all had was, “Well, we gotta learn the “Monster Mash”. We’re gonna play a Halloween party, we gotta know that song.” And so, I really drilled down on it. I played drums and it’s a great drum part. If you’re not gonna start it off with chains on the ground and blowing bubbles in a straw—which shouldn’t do if you’re playing a party, ‘cause that’s just—people don’t know what’s happening. ',\n",

And so, you know, I moved out of my mom’s house when I was 18 years old. I did not go to college. I dropped out of high school my sophomore year. But for most of my friends, you know, once you’re turning 18 and it’s time to move out, the good majority of my friends were going to college. You know? And for most of my friends, it was either a choice between Tallahassee or Gainesville. But between the two college towns in Florida, Gainesville has always had just like such a more vibrant music scene happening. It just felt like that’s where everything was going on, in Florida. And I’m not sure what started it that way, but it definitely, like, predated me going there and—you know, there was—there was real venues, in Gainesville. There was, like, real record labels and there were real bands that were national, touring acts. And there was—you know, there was like history there, connected to music, too. Even with, like—that’s where Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were from. That’s—you know, like it—there was—in the punk scene, it was really happening at the time. That was where, like, Hot Water Music was from and they were really going off at the time. And then, also you know, the band Less Than Jake—like, they were signed to a major label. Real, touring bands. So, that’s where—that’s where I wanted to be. And there was also, you know—in addition to the music scene, there was an activist scene happening there.

But my overall musical gateway into punk was through other bands that were influenced by punk and those influences—which were—which were demonstrated by them, weren’t necessarily understood by me. Like, for instance, I loved Guns N’ Roses when I was in the third grade. That was, like, my first band I really, really, really super connected with. And I started wearing a Sid Vicious, like, lock and chain collar because Duff McKagan wore one. Not because I knew who Sid Vicious, was. You know?

We moved to South Florida because my grandmother already lived there as well as my aunt and uncle. And my aunt and uncle attended a Presbyterian church. And so, my mother started bringing my brother and I to the Presbyterian church. We weren’t a super religious family. I think, really, what it comes down to is my mom was, like, looking for the social aspect of it: trying to meet people in a new place, you know. So, my mother would go and do whatever the adults were doing and me and my brother had to be a part of the youth groups. And then, in addition to like whatever was going on, on Sundays, the youth group there at the Presbyterian church offered a Wednesday after class, you know, youth group. Whatever. So, I think again, you know, my mother had to work late, and she would send me and my brother to youth group. It was right across the street from our—my middle school. That’s where my first group of friends I developed in South Florida were through the youth group. And there was two kids in particular—my friend RJ and my friend Nick, they were brothers who—RJ played guitar and Nick was a drummer. And we just really connected. We were both into the same type of music at the time, specifically like were hugely influenced by Nirvana and Pearl Jam. And, you know, we loved Nirvana and Pearl Jam. And then we also were really into, like, classic rock bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin and the Doors and the Grateful Dead. And so, we—you know, we would talk all the time about starting our own bands. ‘Cause, like, youth group for us was nothing about God or about religion. It was just a chance to hang out for us—to the point where we would get into a lot of trouble. But there was music involved in it, too. You know. We were singing in choir. We were playing in bell choir. But we would talk about starting our own bands and there was a once a year talent show. So, our first submission into the talent show—there was a group of, like, five or six of us. We did an acapella version of ',\n",

But they would let us practice there. So, we had put our band together and that second talent show, we played like—you know, electric guitars, amplified drummer. We did a cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine”. And then the third year, we did a cover of “Heart-Shaped Box”, Nirvana. And that was when they asked us to never play at the talent show again.',\n",

       "   '[Jordan chuckles.]',\n",
       "   ' And what you would listen to and think, “Oh, that’s punk.” And then probably when I was, like—I had, like, a political awakening, let’s say, around like 15 or 16 years old, after I got arrested and beat up by the cops. And at that point, I really split and got into, like, a section of punk rock or a subgenre of punk, like—the anarcho-punk movement. And I got really into the UK peace punk bands and the scene that was happening in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the time. So, bands, like, from the UK. Like Crass and Omega Tribe, the Mob, Zounds, Poison Girls, really early Chumbawamba, and then specifically also this band called the Apostles. And a lot of those bands had a really hippie sound. Like, they were—they would have slogans like, “Punk is hippie, hippie is punk.” You know. It—there would be a lot of acoustic guitars in it. And so, prior to that, I had always actually been the bass player in band—in my punk bands. And I was playing in a band at the time, called Common Affliction. And we were like a grimecore band, similar again to the Minneapolis scene bands I was listening to like Doom and Destroy, Code 13, and Civil Disobedience. And so, we were much more like that and that all felt very reliant on being in a band and, you know, we were—we were—we were young, you know. Like, there was egos. Whatever. Like, and for whatever reason it just wasn’t—it wasn’t happening that much. And some of us were serious about it being like, you know—I wanted it to be like, “This is the rest of my life.” You know.

We need to do this.” And other people were—you know, no fault to them or anything, but other people were more about, like, “Let’s just play music once a week and see what happens.” You know? And so, we kind of had like a falling out at some point or whatever. Not that we broke up, but I was like, “I wanna do my own thing. Like, I feel like I just need to, like, try something else.” And so, without any real intention, it was like—maybe October or something like that. I was like, “By December, I wanna write ten songs on my acoustic guitar and I want to record them on—” My mother had gotten me, like, a 4-track cassette tape recorder. “And I wanna record them on a demo and then I’ll just dub some copies.” ‘Cause that’s how we would distribute music, then. We would record it on cassette and then just make copies of the cassette. We’d go to Kinkos. We’d scan copies of, like, an insert. Put in the cassette. And then give them away or whatever.',\n",

       "   'The first time somebody played Against Me! for me, there was kind of a legend surrounding the album. Like, I think the spiel I got was like, “You have to hear this band. It’s just one person and they only play in laundromats.” ',\n",

       "   ' Um. Maybe we did play subsequent laundromats, but it was really this one legendary laundromat show that that was all born from. But, you know, we really like—we didn’t fit anywhere, as a band. And so, starting out in Southwest Florida, as I said, where at first there was no place to play, you know, we would busk on street corners or we would, like… you know, we got really into the activist scene and really into being part of Food Not Bombs and what was called FRAN—the Florida Radical Activist Networks, where a bunch of people who did Food Not Bombs in their different towns would meet up once a month and talk about what we were doing and then we’d organize things like youth liberation conferences or mayday gatherings. And so, we’d like go and camp in the middle of the Ocala National Forest for a week and, you know, me and Kevin—who was the original drummer in Against Me!—he would bring his pickle buckets and I would bring my acoustic guitar. And I saw that as like the advantage too, then, of the acoustic guitar. It was like, “Oh, we don’t need amplifiers.” If we can’t have a venue to play at, let’s just take that a step further and like disown it. And be like, “Well, not only are we not gonna wanna play on a stage, we’re not even gonna use amps and that’ll like give us an independence and ability to adapt where all these other bands that are existing in South Florida, bemoaning the fact that they don’t have a venue to play—like, we’ll have an edge over them in this way.” But there was a record store in South Florida, called Higher Learning, that was probably like our first place that we played the most shows at. But it was all very just like the local friends. And then when we moved to Gainesville, we really weren’t accepted by the scene there at first, at all. And the place that we played at was the Civic Media Center, which was a local nonprofit, volunteer run, anti-corporate press library and activist space. And so, I started volunteering there and eventually, like, they let me start booking shows there, even. But that was where Against Me! would play all the time. And we weren’t accepted in the bar scene. We weren’t even accepted in the house show scene, in Gainesville. And it took—wasn’t until a number of years later, when we put out a record with No Idea Records, with—which was, like, the local label of lore that—that that happened. But our first show—our first tours were all, you know, self-booked, specifically leaning on a resource called Book Your Own ',\n",
       "   '[Censored]',\n",
       "   ' Life. Which was this zine that just had, like, a list of phone numbers and a list of addresses for houses or basements or show spaces across America. And I would call them up or write them a letter and send them a tape and be like, “Can we play?” And so, we did two tours like that—where it was like month long tours that, you know, starting out go on the road and there’s 30 shows booked, but at the end of it we maybe played a dozen each time. And you know, we played anywhere. Anywhere that would have us.',\n",

       "   'New Wave',\n",
       "   ', which was our first record with Butch, we made with J. Robbins—who is a great producer in his own right. And that was our first experience with a producer. But the kind of classic way it works when you’re in a punk band and you start working with producers is that you’ll be like, “I wanna work with a producer.” And then you’ll get in the studio with a producer and you will do nothing but battle that producer and refuse to cooperate or do anything they say. You know? ‘Cause you’re punk and you want your independence. ',\n",
       "   '[Jordan agrees with a chuckle.]',\n",
       "   ' You know? You don’t want anyone messing with your sound. So, like, Butch immediately just had this ability to kind of disarm all that. And it really, like, just spoke to him being genuine. You know? Like, when the conversation came up after, “Okay, we signed to a major label,” A&R person brings up, you know, like, “Okay, what producer do you wanna work with?” And there’s the immediate list of these—the biggest names in music that you’ve ever heard of that you’re thinking, like, “Yeah, right. None of these people wanna work with us.” And then you get one that does wanna work with you. Like, what could have happened was that one who did wanna work with you could have just totally phoned it in and could have put you through their usual mold of what they do with every band and not really paid that much attention and had a dozen other projects going on at the same time. But Butch wasn’t like that at all. He was all in, there everyday at the studio, everyday during pre-production. And really, you know, devoted himself to understanding what the band was about, to understanding where our limitations were, where we could be pushed to grow, and to doing it in a way where we were able to hold on to our identity and successfully placed himself as a buffer between us and the record label to protect us. Which I will be forever grateful for. And at the same time, also really giving us the chance to learn in the studio—like, this is what this gear does. Like, “Hey! You’re—you all signed a major label deal and you’re making a million-dollar record in a studio right now and you’re gonna spend three months here. You should get—you should really get something out of this, beyond your record. You should get some experience that you could use for the rest of your life.” ',\n",

       "   'You mentioned having a producer that kind of acts as a buffer between, you know, you and the label. Obviously, you know, the music industry has changed a ton since you’ve been in it. Do you feel like record labels, you know, try and influence music in the same way that they did, you know, when you were first starting out?',\n",

       "   'laura',\n",
       "   'Ultimately, that was the realization I had that kind of tipped me towards the decision of signing to a major label—was, you know, you’re coming up when I came up, you’re kind of instilled with this fear of, like, “Oh, the major label, they’re going to try and change your sound. You’re gonna sign this contract and take this money and then you’re selling your soul.” But I realized, like, through the course of the first three Against Me! records, working with indies: a contract doesn’t change anything or protect you or in any way, like—you know, you can have a contract that guarantees and stipulates complete artistic control and freedom. But when it comes down to it, unless you’re gonna enter into like a glass bubble, then, when you record that album, like—if you’re working with other people, other people are going to want to interject their inner—their opinions. They’re gonna wanna feel involved too. And it will behoove you to involve them, if you want them to work on your record and have it be successful. ‘Cause what kind of jerk is like, “You should have no say in anything I’m doing right now. This is all about me and then you should go out and work and make me a star!” Like, “And we’ll make money.” Like, that’s terrible! ',\n",
       "   '[Jordan chuckles.]',\n",
       "   ' That’s just a terrible attitude! So, you know, we went through our third album experience where we stayed with our indie. We didn’t sign a contract. So, in theory, we have complete creative control. And we made the record we wanted to make and handed it in. And they’re like, “We don’t like it. We want you to change the track listing. We don’t like the artwork. You should make the name bigger on the cover.” And they told us their opinions. And there was no contractual reason why we should have to listen to any of those things, but there’s the social pressure reason of why you should listen to those things. And so then, you know—then you have a major label come to you who are like, “We’re gonna give you an unfathomable amount of money and we’re gonna give you a contract that actually says you have artistic freedom and then you just know that you’re still going to have those same social pressures of—” You’re choosing to work with somebody. You’re choosing to have a work relationship with them and they’re going to interject your opinion. But you know, like, I remember specifically, specifically this moment with our A&R person coming into the studio when we were with Butch and they’re like, “Hey, okay, so—I’ve got these lyric ideas for you. Something like, ‘I’m running, I’m jumping, I’m singing, I’m dancing, I’m running, I’m jumping.’”',\n",

This is what I’m going to do right now.” I really like felt it around me with other people coming out—whether that was, like, my friend Mina Caputo. I remember reading about her coming out. And, like, those little bits of like—it’s like a trail you’re following. And every time you see someone else come out and accept themselves, it empowers you to accept yourself and be who you are.

Like, I could come out right now and I could be—I could be happy. I could just, like, be accepted in the world and, you know, not ridiculed and just like maybe there’s room for me in society to, like, have rights. Whereas now, so much of that seems in question and uncertain and it just seems so much scarier. I mean, even—you know, I look at like—when was it, in 2015 or 2016? Where, like, the Obama administration, you know, came out and they were like, “Transgender people, we see you. We recognize you. We have your backs.” Like, that was just a crazy moment to experience. You know? To feel, like, recognized by your government as legitimate and that you would maybe be protected somehow. Whereas now, it’s like this worry of like, “Am I going to be able to continue to have access to hormones? Do I need to—do—how do I approach that?” Or like, “When are they going to, like, totally screw me over with healthcare?” Like, just all these very real fears that, you know, again I feel pretty naïve about ‘cause these are fears that transgender people or queer people have, you know, dealt with throughout history.',\n",

       "   'Bought to Rot',\n",
       "   ', on a label here in Chicago—Bloodshot Records—and I spent most of 2018-2019 touring on that. And then Against Me! had been playing shows through 2019, too. And we had been—you know, I had been writing songs during that whole time. And we had been working on them. And then, start of this year, we spent a week together in the studio in January. A week together in the studio in February. A week together in the studio in March. I played the Bernie Sanders rally, in Lansing, Michigan. And then we headed out on what was supposed to be a three weeklong tour. We got three days into the tour and we had to cancel. We had to go home. That was when the pandemic hit. So, it became really clear—once we all got home, and none of us—you know, none of us live in the same city. None of us live in the same state. So, it became really clear once we were home that, you know, tour by tour we were having to cancel the year and all of our plans were falling apart and that there was no real way to continue on working on a record. ‘Cause we just couldn’t get into a room. So, at the time—you know, I had like a good 30, 35 songs. And we still weren’t in a place where it was like, “Alright, we’re ready to record. We know what the record is.” We were still writing and working on it. So, it’s not like—you know, that these exact 14 songs just would’ve been the exact Against Me! record. It’s very realistic there would have been one or two songs maybe on that and the rest of them would’ve been totally different songs. Or, you know, even newly written or of the other, like, 15+ that I still have that I’m sitting on. You know? But with this being kind of open ended and not knowing, like, “Okay, so are we gonna get together again in a year? Or two years?” And if it’s like two years, is it gonna be like, “Hey. Hey everybody. Remember those 35 songs that we were working on two years ago that we weren’t really gelling with, but—hey, let’s jump right back into those.” Right? Like, that didn’t seem like it was gonna be anything anybody wanted to do. And… I took a look at the songs that I had, and I just was like, “You know what? I think there’s just like a record here already.” And specifically, also, with choosing the songs I did, it was like—you know, there’s some songs here that maybe they weren’t working in the full band context, but I like them! They make me happy. They make me happy to sit in my bathroom. It has the best acoustics in my apartment. To sit in my bathroom and to play them on my acoustic guitar and to sing them. I like them. So, in almost a selfish way in that—in that sense, I was just like, “I just wanna record them. I wanna record an album, because it’ll give me something to do. And it feels productive and it feels right to be productive.” All I’m doing every day is waking up, turning on the news and seeing reports of, you know—of job loss. Of people being unable to pay their rent. I’m hearing from my friends about venues closing down, about the music industry just in total collapse. So, the idea of like, “Okay, yeah, on the one side, I am a touring musician. That’s what I do. But on the other side, like, I’m also a songwriter and I’m a recording musician. And I can’t tour right now, but I can record. I can continue to write songs.” So, if I can do that and all I have to do, in order to do that, is to adjust my parameters—adjust my scope—and realize my limitations of: I can’t do it with my band, ‘cause they’re not here. I have to do it in Chicago, ‘cause that’s where I live. ',\n",

       "   'This was actually the very first song out of any of the songs on the record that was written. And I wrote this song probably end of 2017, beginning of 2018. And I have—my friend, Patrick, who is an old friend from Gainesville—I, you know—Patrick played in bands for years that Against Me! toured with and we were both friends in Gainesville. And then we both moved away from Gainesville. And I fell out of touch with him for a number of years, but at the time I had gotten back into contact with him and we just kind of—we would text every day and just talk about what was going on. They were, like, living in a really isolated place. I was really isolated feeling, at least. Emotionally. And we were identifying with each other. And it was stark to me, feeling the years between us. Feeling the way things had changed. Being able to, like, really directly feel still a connection to, like, “Hey, remember that tour we took in July of 2001 or ’02? And it was a summer tour and, you know, I can—I can remember your jean shorts and I can remember the feeling of swimming in a stream in Montana. I can remember, you know, jumping on the roof of the vans when we were stuck in traffic, in Iowa. I can remember trying to get over this one pass in the Rocky Mountains.” Like, all just like these really direct memories and then feeling that gulf of time between us and not understanding how far—how we had drifted so far away from the people that we used to be or how things had changed and the ways they had changed and the people that were close between us who we had lost along the way. And ultimately, like, when I boiled all the emotions down, there was just that feeling of, like—I just want them to stay alive. I—like, you know, I know that they may be having a hard time and maybe that’s even selfish, but like—if you stay alive then I’ll stay alive. You know? Like—and I just want you to stay alive. I want you selfishly stay alive, even if it doesn’t have anything to do—even if who we are now doesn’t have anything to do with who we were, just ‘cause of that connection to it, you know? And that was the feeling behind writing the song at the time. And then, as—you know, as the years progressed and as we got to where we are now, it just like resonated more and more of wanting to kind of like boil down the simplest message. You know? Like, just the like, “What is the most important thing right now?” You know? And you kind of like would hear about that even more so at the start of the pandemic, of like—of like, you know, “Go easy on yourself if you’re not accomplishing that much right now.” You know. “What’s important is—” Like, that type of line of thinking. And all that’s important is like just stay alive. Just stay alive. You can—you can kind of screw things up right now, whatever. That’s fine. Just stay alive. You know. Maybe you’re not being as productive as you could. Just stay alive.',\n",

We might put the portable dishwasher there. Also, apparently you can’t buy refrigerators right now? I don’t know. Our show is produced by speaking into microphones. Our producer is Kevin Ferguson. Jesus Ambrosio and Jordan Kauwling are our associate producers. We get help from Casey O’Brien and Kristen Bennett. Our interstitial music is by Dan Wally, also known as DJW. Our theme song is by the band The Go! Team. Thanks to them and to their label, Memphis Industries, for sharing it. Great band! Great music! Go get some.
