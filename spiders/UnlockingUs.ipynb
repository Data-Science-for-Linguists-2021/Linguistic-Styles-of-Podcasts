       " ' Transcript  SPEAKER:  Hi everyone, I’m SPEAKER, and this is  Unlocking Us . This week, I am talking to an amazing writer, poet, cultural critic, music critic, SPEAKER, he is the author of  A Little Devil in America: Notes in Praise of Black Performance . First of all, I have to tell you, it is one of the most lyrical, beautifully written, stirring, urgent books that I’ve read in my life. And not only is it written beautifully, the content is just… Just the inextricable connection between the history of the United States and Black contribution and Black performance. This is a conversation about history, art, poetry, and some really deep genius in this book and some genius in this man. I cannot wait for you to hear the conversation.  [music]  SPEAKER:  So before we jump into the conversation, let me tell you a little bit about Hanif. SPEAKER is a New York Times Best-Selling poet, essayist, and cultural critic from Columbus, Ohio. His poetry has been published in PEN American, Muzzle, Vinyl, and other journals. His essays and music criticism have been published in the New Yorker, Pitchfork, The New York Times and Fader. He is the author of poetry collections, including  The Crown Ain’t Worth Much and  A Fortune for Your Disaster . He is the author of the essay collection  They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us  and  Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest . Hanif was named guest curator at large at BAM, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, beginning in January of 2021, and is the host of the new Sonos podcast  Object Of Sound . He is a graduate of Beechcroft High School. Welcome Hanif. Hanif, welcome to  Unlocking Us . Super grateful for your time today.  SPEAKER:  Thank you so much for having me.  SPEAKER:  I have so many questions and thoughts about  A Little Devil in America , your newest book. I read the books with members of the team, and then we do a prep, and most of the time I read with our producer here on our side, Laura Mayes, and when we got on the Zoom call, we just sat looking at each other without saying anything. And she just finally said, “Art.”  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  I said, “Yeah, art, art.” No words, art. Just wow, thank you. And congratulations.  SPEAKER:  Thank you. You know, it feels weird because as books go, as you know, you write a thing much longer before it comes out into the world, and I’m at a stage of kind of mourning a bit because this book was so fun to write and so exciting to write, and I’m on the verge of it no longer being just mine and it will become the public’s, which is a wonderful thing, but something that I’m mourning for the first time in my book writing life.  SPEAKER:  I weirdly know that feeling, because there’s so much vulnerability in putting words to the paper, and there’s so much warmth and love in that process, and then when it becomes public, it becomes something else. Doesn’t it?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, you have no control over what that something else is, so it’s kind of like the mutating of your initial ideas and emotions is something that I think as writers, you have to get comfortable with because we can’t control the shape the things take when the world gets a hold of them.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, it’s very Jungian too, because I think in some ways, people project what they need the book to be.  SPEAKER:  Right.  SPEAKER:  That’s hard. I want to talk about it, but I want to start with this question first. Which is a big question. Can you tell us your story? [chuckle] Can you start from the very beginning? And tell us your story?  SPEAKER:  Yes, I was born on the east side of Columbus, Ohio. I’m the youngest of four, which means for me a lot of things, but I think it most prominently means that I am bad at keeping secrets and bad at holding on to things that might gain me an advantage emotional or otherwise in the world. I lost my mother when I was… In the year right before I turned 13, and I think because of that, I shaped my ideas around grief pretty clearly. I spent a lot of time in my life, childhood and adult life, thinking about grief as something not to let go and depart from, but as something to adjust towards carrying every year or every moment even. And I think that in some ways, so much of my story is defined by my capacity to feel very large things and remain curious about them and attempt to not be overwhelmed by them, you know?  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  That’s probably an abridged version of the story, [chuckle] I skipped decades, but I feel like the least interesting parts are in those decades.  SPEAKER:  It’s interesting that you say this about grief, because one of the things I’ll say about your writing, and not just your writing here, but a lot of things that I’ve read, your poetry, New York Times, stories, this  A Little Devil in America , You don’t swing from love to rage or from hope to despair, or from sorrow and grief to joy. You somehow manage to write in a space that contains them all at the same time. Is that a fair assessment?  SPEAKER:  That’s a very kind assessment, [chuckle] I think. I’m often trying to complicate the feeling beyond the initial feeling. I’m kind of knocking on the door of the, “Why do I feel this way?” Is sometimes when I am sad, for example, I’m sad because I am envious, or I am sad because I am romantic, or I’m mad because I am lonely, these kind of things that tease out the secondary colors that kind of make up the emotional sunset that I’m always kind of staring at, it’s kind of easy for me to point at the large orange sky going down behind the skyline, but I think I like to take inventory of the colors resting beneath that because that for me is where the kind of good and complicated and more thoughtful work of the emotional archival comes into play, and that also makes it so that I am not just shouting into a void. I’m not necessarily trying to solve anything either, which is very important, I think in my work. I’m not trying to solve any emotional puzzles, and I find myself more often trying to take inventory.  SPEAKER:  I’m having a moment of stunned silence, and I’ll tell you why, because I’m an emotions researcher, and I interview a lot of emotion researchers or affects researchers on the podcast, and you just said in 70 words what we spend three hours trying to explain with terms like emotional granularity and neutrality about emotional outcome. First, Jesus, oh my God, I don’t know how that happened, but how did you learn this? Is this the poet in you and the writer in you that doesn’t fall prey to the big name emotions, but you get granular? How did you learn to do that?  SPEAKER:  I think I’m almost required to understand my feelings as complex because otherwise I’d be overwhelmed by the large-ness of them. And so I don’t know if it’s the poet in me, but it is the person who has been heart-broken enough times by the state of my living and almost requires something else to propel me towards the next potential for heartbreak or the next potential for pleasure that is greater understood by the knowing of the heartbreak. This is nothing I’ve studied. I think I like to ask questions of the things I feel because if I just sit in those feelings and accept them as they are, at least in my case, I would be kind of swept away by something that would at least for a little while render me incapable of moving forward emotionally.  SPEAKER:  The enormity of it.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, yeah. To be frank, I’m sad often. I am always either mourning something or preparing to mourn something. My therapist would tell me that I fixate too much on the potential for mourning, but I think that even through that fixation, what I’m actually doing is cultivating a generosity for the parts of the world that are still here and still very touchable to me, and so I think I need to balance those things, evenly.  SPEAKER:  I want to tell people about the book and then I want to talk about what you just so beautifully explained and how it plays out in the book, because I’m telling you, even with the eyes of someone who studied emotion for decades, it’s interesting, there’s a sweeping away by overwhelm that is really, I think dangerous, at least for me personally, and then there’s a being swept away by a refusal to deny the full human experience.  SPEAKER:  Right.  SPEAKER:  That’s beautiful.  SPEAKER:  Right.  SPEAKER:  Do you know what I mean? There’s different sweepings, aren’t there?  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  Yes indeed, yeah. I’m someone who like a lot of people, I’ve spent the last 12-ish months in my house largely, and I live alone with my dog, and so that taking inventory for the first time in my life, as much therapy as I’ve done in my adult life, I’ve had this immense discomfort of checking in with myself on a frequent basis where I’m very good at checking in with myself when it seems like things are not going great. But I think in the past year, I’ve also really fostered discomfort with checking in with myself, just even hourly, kind of taking that inventory of how I’m feeling. And if I’m feeling fine, not being concerned with that feeling of fineness. I’m someone who was for a long time now, for well over a decade, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety disorders, and so so much of my aversion of checking in with myself is an easy way to open a door through which I’ll just spiral through an anxiety tunnel, right? But there’s just something interesting about what we’re talking about in terms of breaking down the enormity of the emotion into more reasonable kind of bite-sized portions that serve my emotional state, where it’s important to ask myself what I need in the moment, and even if what I need in the moment is nothing, but what I have, it is still good to kind of tap on the window and take that little smaller inventory.  SPEAKER:  I know there’s so much wisdom in what you’re saying. Did you grow up in a family where you talked about emotion, that you were encouraged to talk about feelings, that therapy was normalized?  SPEAKER:  No, and this is through no fault of my family’s, I think it also wasn’t punished. Talking about emotions wasn’t something that was frowned upon, but I think that if there is a flaw here it’s in me. I did not know how to articulate my feelings at all, and I acted out… Most of my articulation was through acting out, which alienated anyone from being very interested in how I was feeling. I didn’t start therapy until, I guess this is still kind of young, but I didn’t start therapy until my early 20s, and I think that learning how to speak out loud about things I’m feeling is an ongoing battle.  SPEAKER:  Me too, it’s hard.  SPEAKER:  There are things I tell my therapist that I’m immensely comfortable telling my therapist, but she is sometimes not the person who needs to hear it. I can’t easily express that to the people who need to hear it because the stakes are higher.  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  The stakes are way different.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, and the vulnerability is different. I was just talking about this actually yesterday in therapy. And I just said I’m so much better at talking about how I feel to people who are not really personally affected by my choices and my behavior. But when I have to talk about how I feel with people who feel the direct ramifications of how I show up sometimes I get so scared and defensive, so I get what you’re saying. I always wonder, could you just write a note to this person for me? Tell me the story behind  A Little Devil in America . Tell me how it started, what your thinking was and how it evolved, if it did.  SPEAKER:  I was in Memphis in what had to be 2016 or 2017, early 2017 maybe. And I was in the Stax Records Museum, and I saw the Cadillac that Isaac Hayes was gifted when he put out his Black Moses Album, and he loved that Cadillac and it was taken from him because he went bankrupt and had to sacrifice it. And Stax bought the car, didn’t return it to him and kind of like just held it and put it in this museum, and I was really struck by that. It bothered me a bit, for a few reasons, but because earlier in that day, I had driven past Graceland, also in Memphis, the Elvis Estate, and I had seen the artifacts of his living sprawled out in a way that was so touchable for people, and I began to think about the varied ways that Blackness and Black performance is commodified and reshaped for American consumption, and oftentimes those Black performers do not get what they’re owed while they’re alive. And so I started this idea of a book about… I wrote this long essay about Justin Timberlake, also from Memphis, and Al Green, and Elvis, and Isaac Hayes, and I thought at first I was writing a book about America’s response to Black performance through the lens of appropriation and through the lens of commodification, and through the lens of whiteness as a container for Black performance.  SPEAKER:  And then Toni Morrison died and I did away with about half the book, which honestly was the second time in a row. My last book of poems before this one, I did away with half the book near the finish line too. But I’d had a first draft and I didn’t feel good about the first draft, and I’m a big Toni Morrison disciple. Ms. Morrison means a lot to me, to have a writer like that from Ohio is a huge blueprint for me. And a thing that Ms. Morrison talked about often is the removal of any investment in whiteness from the work, and how that is the greatest thing for the Black imagination, for a writer, for any kind of maker. And I began to kind of think, “Well, what if I just wrote a book that was celebrating the many nuances of the ways I have performed, of the ways that I’ve witnessed Black performance? What if instead of writing about what Aretha Franklin did not get or what Aretha Franklin deserved, but did not receive, what if I wrote about this beautiful, sprawling, day long funeral where everyone gathered to not let her die? Essentially, to keep her alive for another day.” That kind of thing. I began seeking pleasure, because I think that pleasure is another form of critique, right?  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  Or at least my pursuit of pleasure exists in opposition to sometimes a more exhausting critique. And the type of pleasure I was after in this book, the type of pleasure I was trying to articulate is perhaps nodding and winking and nudging people I love. Like the piece on Spades in the book is so much… It almost requires an engagement with a type of love that I feel disconnected from right now, the friends I haven’t seen and the friends that I won’t be around. And so I was almost writing in a language that was intent on giving flowers to people in the moments and the movements that I’ve been a part of, detached from whatever America’s claws might grasp at or not grasp at.  SPEAKER:  I obviously didn’t see the first draft or the first idea, but this book is such a celebration, but yet it’s so rare. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen it done with the amount of craft that I’ve seen it done in your book, where you are just not separating joy from pain and grief from gratitude. It is the full emotional experience to read this book and the critique is for me alive and well, but there’s no question as I read it, that Black performance and Black celebration is centered in this book.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, that’s good to hear. And I think so much of it required me asking questions of what I defined as performance and maybe unraveling even the language of performance or performativity as something that is most often derided on the Internet, which I’m not opposed to that deriding, I suppose sometimes. But understanding performativity as something that has not always entirely been an unhealthy pursuit, particularly for Black Americans who have lived lives where they’ve almost been required to believe themselves capable of something beyond the insufficient way their world sees them. Or for Black Americans who came up in a time, an era which is still existing now, of course, where the search for miracles was prioritized.  SPEAKER:  And so I think about the story of Ellen Armstrong, the magician, who, in the early draft of this book, I knew I needed something about Ellen Armstrong who fascinated me because one of her primary tricks was pulling coins from behind the ears of her audience members, which of course is a common magic trick now, but when you think of Black folks in the era where she was doing magic, in the late 1800s, early 1900s, Black folks who needed to witness something that signaled to them that they had more than they thought they had.  SPEAKER:  And so to pull even a nickel from behind someone’s ear and say, “Well, you keep this now,” is to say, “You thought there was nothing here, but there is actually an abundance that you just haven’t seen yet.” And that for me is how I understood my world as a person among Black people I’ve loved. It’s the same trick as growing up and having a cupboard almost empty and yet a meal appearing on the table an hour later, or new basketball sneakers being put by the door in the day of basketball try-outs despite pay day not being for another 10 days. So I think when I break it down like this, when I think of the performance of miracles or the way that the miracle is a life-saving tool, then it becomes a lot easier for me to dissect what I believe a performance to be and who I believe a performance to serve.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, and it’s incredible. I had never heard of her or her dad, actually. And so she started with her dad, her father passed away, everyone thought that would be the end of the show because how would this young woman take it over, but she never abandoned the Black community either. She stayed in Black churches, Black community centers. One of the things that resonated for me when I was reading it, I have my very marked up book here, the sound of a coin hitting a tin bucket.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  Can you say more about that?  SPEAKER:  Yeah. [chuckle] When I was a kid, sometimes, for example, there was nothing to me like hearing the sounds of food being made in the kitchen. And part of this was because in my family, I didn’t grow up with a lot of money. Some years were better than other years as it goes, I think for families without a lot of money. But in the years where I often questioned, not so dire that I questioned, “Where is the next meal coming from?” But sometimes so dire, where it’s like, “I don’t think we have enough for our next meal.” There was something about the sound of movement happening in the kitchen that made me feel a little bit closer to that miraculous feeling. And so with Ellen Armstrong and the coin hitting the bucket, there’s something about the sound of a miracle as it takes place or the real-time sonics of the impossible coming to life and being animated that is also in line with me, as someone who’s essentially a music writer and someone who’s invested in writing about music and dissecting what sound does to our brains and our bodies and our feelings.  SPEAKER:  There’s so many things I want to jump into, but I have to say, “Tell me about the love letter.” That’s what I’m going to call it. You can correct me. The love letter you write to Soul Train.  SPEAKER:  A wild thing about this book that I feel like anyone who bounces around on my social media knows is this. So when I first started writing this book, I found a homie of mine who had every episode from the 70s and 80s of Soul Train on a hard drive.  SPEAKER:  Oh, God.  SPEAKER:  And I was just like, “I’ve got to have it, I’ll pay whatever. Random House maybe will reimburse me for this but I’ve got to have it.” And so he sent it to me, he looked out. He sent it to me for free and actually just hit me with a 90s hard drive on Monday that I can’t wait to get into now that on the other side of this book. And so I spent… I’ve been trying to chart the hours, because so many people have asked me what the Soul Train thing. It had to have been 100 hours watching Soul Train just at night, dragging it to any place, any episode. And I became obsessed with the continuity of the Soul Train Line, where occasionally you would see someone who stood out in maybe an episode from February 1977, and then in October in 1977, you see him again, different outfit, different dance moves.  SPEAKER:  Yep.  SPEAKER:  Different hairstyle sometimes. And it felt familial. I spent so much time deep in the Soul Train archives that it felt like a familial experience. It felt like I was present with family who kept showing up in all these different modes. And growing up for me and seeing Soul Train reruns, Don Cornelius was almost a mythical figure. He was like walk-on-water level of cool. And to get to think about him from a perspective of gratitude first as someone who primarily had a vision for Black people beyond suffering.  SPEAKER:  He loved Black people so much that he imagined the fullness of them and created a platform where that fullness could be on display. I loved spending time thinking through Soul Train, and I loved spending time contrasting Soul Train with the Depression-era dance marathons which are not as romantic. Those are horrific, and I think an especially odd horror of American history. But also, there was something I was wrestling with about companionship and being present alongside someone who is your propeller through either a short line or a long run of months holding each other up. And I’m a bit of a romantic. And so I think it was also a good chance for me to consider my many relationships that I’ve had in life, romantic and otherwise, and how I’ve held and how I’ve been held, and the sometimes unevenness of those things.  SPEAKER:  Growing up, it was really weird, I have to ask my parents about this. My parents were really strict around television. I was allowed to watch Disney and Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom, they both came on Sundays. I was allowed to watch 60 to 90 minutes of cartoons on Saturday morning, and I was allowed to watch Soul Train.  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  And that was it.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  And I thought of Don Cornelius as God in many ways.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  He just seemed not of this Earth to me. And I got really emotional reading that, because there were several moments that I remember, and the experience was different for me, for sure, as a white kid watching Soul Train. But I remember the first time I saw couples with matching outfits. That didn’t start that way.  SPEAKER:  No, yeah.  SPEAKER:  It was like, “Oh my God, this is next level now.” Or, I will tell you one of my most excruciating stories. I can’t find the episode, maybe you can tell me. And I only was thinking about it because you were talking about the beauty of partnership in the Line, the Soul Train Line, but there was an episode where a woman, I think came down the Line by herself, and she did the splits, and she stayed in the splits while the top half of her body did the robot.  SPEAKER:  Yep, yeah.  SPEAKER:  Do you remember this?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, I’ve seen that. Yeah.  SPEAKER:  I thought this was the most important thing I’d ever seen. And so I remember with the seventh grade dance, I tried it in public.  SPEAKER:  Oh, no. [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  I know, it was a major white girl mistake, but what I forgot is when I was done, people were just kind of like shielding their eyes and walking away from me. But what I forgot was she ended up with her arms kind of hanging like this, like in the scarecrow and her partner picked her up from behind.  SPEAKER:  Yup.  SPEAKER:  But I had no way up off the floor in the splits, and so I just had to roll over and kind of beach it out. It was awful, but I just remember thinking the clothes, the platform shoes. I remember seeing the Sugar Hill Gang for the first time on Soul Train, the Isley Brothers. I would save up my money and get whatever eight-track was on that week. I don’t you can separate American History from Soul Train, do you? At least not music history.  SPEAKER:  No, for me the history of America is so tied up in its music. You know what’s fascinating about having a thing like a hard drive with every ’70s and ’80s Soul Train episode on it, is that you’re seeing a progression of fashion, not only of fashion and aesthetics, but also of politics in a way, of commercials. All the episodes I have, have the real-time commercials that aired during the episode, so that’s fascinating. And I think it’s a story also of the continual… Long arc of Black liberation through movement and through fashion. It’s a lot about those early ’70s Soul Train Line is that you would see people in outfits that maybe kind of looked like they just got off work. Working class folks who had, maybe, three-piece suits on, women with like long skirts kind of thing.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, and blazers.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, blazers, a lot of blazers.  SPEAKER:  Tons of blazers, like work blazers.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. Right. I couldn’t really hit this in the book, but I was thinking about this, the difference between the work blazer and a fashion blazer, you know what I mean?  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  And then you get ’77-ish. ’76, ’77, it’s way different vibe. People are coming in the best of their best.  SPEAKER:  Gold lame.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, right. The outfits definitely take a turn. The interviews kind of take a little bit of a turn. Don Cornelius himself takes a little bit of a turn. And I’m so excited. I told myself that I’ve got to get through the book publicity arc before I dive into the ’90s hard drive. But I’m so excited to get into those because I think I’ve watched a couple of clips, I’ve cheated and watched a couple. Oh wow, this is a whole other thing. The turnover from even ’88 to ’91, like house party era fashion is a whole other thing.  SPEAKER:  Do you think from the early ’70s, I guess when I started watching, to when it went from like coming from work to real self-expression, that it became more Black-centric, that it became more political in both fashion and style and more celebratory in that? Because I think Soul Train was the first time I ever saw platform shoes, and these guys would have on like really big afros and 6-inch platform shoes.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. Well, yes, and I also think that in some ways it became more sexually liberating in some ways in nature.  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  Which I think is something that really jumps out in the ’80s, and then it also gets more creative in the ’80s. There’s the guy who would occasionally be in the Line, he would spin a basketball on his finger. He would go through the Line with a basketball. And also, the Line often took on the aesthetics of… There was a point where a lot of women in the Line looked like Jody Watley, who began in the Line and then became the pop star. And there was an era where a lot of the men were trying this heavily accessorized Michael Jackson thing. So in a way, the Line really reflected Black popular culture, particularly in the ’80s when they kind of started to do that really aggressively in a way that I find so fascinating. There were women who… Putting on a kind of Grace Jones air, right?  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  It was reflecting so many facets of Black pop culture which to me was exciting. If I talk about the multitude and this nature of Black folks, it is a Soul Train Line wherein someone is aesthetically mimicking Grace Jones and someone else is aesthetically mimicking Jody Watley or Janet Jackson.  SPEAKER:  One thing that I underlined in the book, and can I read you a quote from your own book?  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  Sure. I have not read the book in a long time, so I’d be happy to hear a quote from it.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. This is a great quote. “I consider often the difference between showing off and showing out. How showing off is something you do for the world at large and showing out is something you do strictly for your people. The people who might not need to be reminded how good you are, but will take the reminder when they can. The Soul Train Line was the gold standard of where one goes to show out.”  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  Oh, tell me more about the difference between showing off and showing out.  SPEAKER:  I grew up playing sports. I grew up in a sports-playing household in a very good sports-playing era, because I grew up in the ’90s. I’m also not someone who’s like, “My era was the best era.” But I grew up in the era of both Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson, and so I sometimes think about athletes as the best example of that line between showing off and showing out. Because sometimes, I think showing off is not bad. I don’t think showing off is necessarily even bad. I think sometimes, showing off is something you do because you yourself cannot believe what you are achieving. Iconically, Michael Jordan against the Blazers, when he hit all those threes and then shrugged while running back down court, that was showing off, but it was him saying, “I cannot wrap my head around what’s happening either.”  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  “I’m surpassing a level of greatness that even I… ” You know what I mean?  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  I think now, not to get too sports-heavy, but the showing out for me is something like Stephen Curry shooting a three and turning to run back down court before it even goes in because the job is done already, right?  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  He understands that the job is done. And to understand the job is done, to understand that you are so good that the job is complete before it’s actually complete, and to acknowledge that you are done with the job before it’s actually complete, is a form of showing out. There’s a Jordan thing where it’s like, “I don’t know what’s going on because I’m so great, but this is even beyond my level of greatness.” And then there’s the Curry thing where it’s like, “I’m actually really certain of my own greatness, so much to the point that I can just be done with this.” It’s like what Rosie Perez, in the book, I talk about how occasionally she would not finish the line. She would stop dancing halfway through and just walk down staring at the camera. She would find the camera and just stare at the camera and walk the last kind of…  SPEAKER:  And look right into it, yeah.  SPEAKER:  The job was done. The job was done in that first half.  SPEAKER:  Do you think you have to have some greatness to back up the showing out?  SPEAKER:  Sometimes, but not always. I’ve certainly lied my way into greatness more than once in my life. Because I think sometimes the function of showing out too, I mentioned this a bit in the Spades piece, is that you have to convince people that you have something you don’t have. Or you have to convince people that you are capable of something that you are not sure you’re capable of yourself, and I feel like so much of my life has operated in that kind of… I’m not an overly confident person, so I think so much of my life is operated in the window of, how can I convince people that I am capable of something that I’m actually not entirely sure I’m capable of?  SPEAKER:  I know that feeling. Let’s go back for a minute, because let me tell you, I knew nothing, nothing but maybe some post-vintage posters I had seen that were nostalgic and looked fun about these dance contests. So to give listeners some background, in case you’re not familiar, I definitely wasn’t, but dance marathons were basically these human endurance contests where couples danced almost non-stop for hundreds and hundreds of hours, as long as a month or two competing for prize money. They started as dance contests in the 1920s, but they turned into these brutal entertainment endurance events during The Great Depression in the 1930s… I’m careful about using the word brutality, but there was definitely a real brutality to these contests. Can you tell us about how these started and what these are and what they meant for people?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, a homie of mine, when he heard about what I was writing about was like, “Have you heard of these depression era dance marathons?” I was like, “No. And I’m not really interested, this isn’t what the book is going to be.” Like, to be frank, I was like, “A bunch of white folks dancing,” like, “I’m good.” He was like, “But wait, wait, wait, I think there’s something emotional in here waiting to be unlocked.” And he sent me this folder. He’s a visual artist, and he’d done some work around them. So he sent me this folder of photos and there was a photo I talk about it in the book where the woman is passed out in the man’s arms and he’s looking at her, and he’s looking at her with this real sense of concern and affection. And I had read the caption on that photo and realized that those two people were not… At least they did not enter the competition in love, it was a person and his neighbor down the street… Or his neighbor’s daughter. And that kind of blew my mind a little bit because I began thinking about this kind of forced collaboration that just by nature of the closeness of it through that something like affection is born or is almost required. Because you’re talking about…  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  You have to hold someone up while they’re sleeping in your arms, and you have to hold a mirror for someone while they carefully take a razor to their face. And I’m not trying to advocate for forced affections, but I am interested in the way that… I personally, though, of course, I’ve never been in a dance marathon, I’m interested in the way that I just by virtue of having to spend time with someone or having to be in a space with someone looks over at them and I catch them in the right light or what have you, and for a moment, I imagine myself in love when I wasn’t before or I find myself going, “Well, where did that feeling come from?” And it is the way that proximity can play tricks on our affections, and sometimes those tricks can last a very long time and become not tricks at all, but…  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  The dance marathon was so interesting to me because it was these people who sometimes had no emotional connections, forced into this really high stakes emotional situation, we’re talking months and months and months of just being essentially tethered to a person physically. And I’m interested in what gets born out of that.  SPEAKER:  And not for fun, right?  SPEAKER:  Not for fun, yeah, not for fun.  SPEAKER:  They’re doing this for food, shelter.  SPEAKER:  In the negotiations that had to be made where women had to sometimes think about, “Okay, who is a man who is not so heavy that I cannot lift him, but definitely sturdy enough to lift me?” That kind of thing, that really blew my mind. And I don’t know, I worked hard to not overly romanticize the dance marathons because they are horrific. There’s something I know and I’m familiar with and I’m always trying to kind of unravel about close proximity to someone leading to an unexpected bout of affection that we then have to wrestle with or sit with for a long period of time. Which I feel like it’s happening to people in the pandemic, in some ways, where a lot of people are looking at a person’s Instagram or whatever online, they’re like, “I think I want to marry this person.” Well, “Do you want to marry this person or have you just not seen another person for a long time?”  SPEAKER:  Which is hard to parse out sometimes. Yeah, I just thought it was kind of soft copy and fun. I never realized that people were desperately trying to win the money, they were sometimes entering for a place to be that was warm during the day. It might be helpful for you. Will you explain the genesis of this dance contest and how they became a ticket out or a ticket to basic care?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, they kind of came to life in a few different ways, one America at the time was really obsessed with the idea of a marathon or world record setting, was super obsessed with world record setting. And in the book, I talk about Alma Cummings who danced for a series of hours, and then when the news of her dancing traveled across the world, people started to want to surpass her, and then people wanted to surpass other people who were surpassing her.  SPEAKER:  And of course, the evil of America’s innovations thought, “Well, there’s a way to kind of capitalize on this,” tying it to the economic desperation of the times. And particularly in the Midwest, where there were a lot of barns and a lot of space to do this, you can get people to gather and just kind of dance because you got meals and you got a place to sleep. And if you were someone who lived in a place where neither of those things were guaranteed, or if you were someone who’s extra mouth to-feed was a burden on an already strained family, this was the opportunity for you for a long time to be somewhere doing something. But the thing is, on a lot of the competitions, second place didn’t get anything. And so if you danced for 1500 hours and someone else danced for 1500 hours and three minutes, there were some competitions where you just didn’t get anything.  SPEAKER:  God.  SPEAKER:  And that is a bit horrifying.  SPEAKER:  Okay, I have to talk to you a little bit about your writing, because when I read something, I usually put it in one of these buckets, when I read something, I love, this is what I think. One bucket is, “This really helped me understand something new.” The second bucket was, “God, that’s some really good writing and I understand something new.” Three, “Dammit, I wish I would have written that.” And four, “I don’t even wish I would have written that because it would be like standing in front of a piece of art in a museum saying, ‘I think I’ll try painting that some time.’” That’s how I felt when I read your book. No, really. Laura and I were processing the book together… And we don’t use this word very often, I’m very careful with this word, there is some real genius in your book. And Laura said, “This is what I felt like when I saw Hamilton the first time.” You know, really, how did you get these threads together? So I want to walk you through your chapter, the official title is, “Nine Considerations Of Black People In Space.” So we both believe that this chapter should be taught in MFA programs across the world. When you write about poetry, you write it as a poem.  SPEAKER:  You take us different places, you connect. There’s a definition, it may have been Steve Jobs that said, “Creativity is connecting the seemingly unconnectable.” There’s kind of a trope in writing these days where people will give you three disparate things and we need to be awed about how they tie them all together. Do you know what I’m talking about?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, because I do it sometimes, surely.  SPEAKER:  No, no, no, no, no, you don’t. Not in anything I’ve read. What you do is you start this chapter with a quote. It says… This is what you write, “To be fair, I cannot claim that I love the moon as much as all my pals, and ancestors, and peers. I maybe do not love the moon as much as other poets who seem to love the moon for what it is capable of doing to the waters or how it seduces the best or worst of an astrological sign.” You start with this beautiful thing about your relationship with the moon, then in the space of just 20 pages, I was laughing out loud to the point where my husband was like, “What’s so funny?” There is this incredible prose about astrology. Then you talk about Robert Hayden, then you talk about Michael Jackson’s death, the moon walk, Bill Bailey, the moon walk creator, who I always thought it was Michael Jackson, but you teach us. Your mom, the love of stars, how you want to give her the moon, Patti LaBelle and spacesuits, Billy Dee Williams, the most badass man in space, Trayvon Martin. And now, I’m sobbing in this chapter, where at first, I was swooning over poetry, then I’m laughing, and now I’m in real tears.  SPEAKER:  Really, I can’t swallow kind of thing. Michael Anderson, I’m still in tears, the astronaut. Octavia Butler, the novelist. Sun Ra, a French flag that says they are Black people in the future. And then you tie this all together for us with just sublime writing.  SPEAKER:  Thank you. That’s very kind.  SPEAKER:  I don’t mean to be kind. I mean, I’m glad I’m being kind. I want to be a kind person.  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  It’s a marvel. It’s a marvel is what it is, it’s a fucking marvel. How does this happen? Do you think like this?  SPEAKER:  For better or worse, yeah. Sometimes worse, but I’m often beginning with one thing and trying to reverse-engineer some kind of connection points. That piece began with… I had this obsession with the Trayvon Martin aviation experience photo that kind of circulates as a corrective. Or it did circulate as a corrective. It still does a bit, but did prominently after his murder. And then I was thinking about Michael Anderson, the only Black astronaut who died upon that particular space mission. I knew I could not have this book without paying a homage to Octavia Butler, but also the LaBelle spacesuits, I went down a real rabbit hole of those, of really big LaBelle photo on the walls of my dining room, in the kind of feathered spacesuits. And so I think that in my brain, I’m oftentimes running the numbers and asking myself how I can reverse-engineer some kind of connection point to the multiple obsessions that I’m sprinting towards.  SPEAKER:  In some ways, I’m sprinting towards them while trying to outrun the ones that are coming because I know that I have limits with what I can stretch myself to. But something like this where it’s kind of like a bunch of vignettes felt easier for me because each of them are kind of tied to the other one, but they’re not asking anyone to think of what they’re consuming in a strictly firm, intense linear fashion. But it is asking someone to think about the many different ways that Black people have been in a world other than this one. I think about LaBelle as a perfect example of existing in a future that seemed impossible at the time, but it also seemed like they were really shepherding people there just by the aesthetics and the sound. And it always feels, when I write, that none of my ideas are interesting enough on their own. None of the pursuits I have are interesting enough on their own because I’m someone who is easily obsessed with things and easily falls down rabbit holes that don’t really lead to anywhere but my own personal satisfactions.  SPEAKER:  And so there’s a humility for me in understanding that my personal satisfactions have to or are almost required to serve some greater purpose, if I’m committing them to any page that many people are going to read beyond myself.  SPEAKER:  You started us with poetry, and I thought about the moon and I was kind of swept away, but then I was jerked back about a line that you wrote. And I can’t remember it offhand, but when I read it, I guess what I saw was the importance of the moon for enslaved people running at night.  SPEAKER:  Right.  SPEAKER:  But then at the same time, the same moon that might disrupt a kiss with someone we love or might shine a light on someone we love. Again, beauty and pain, making no apologies for co-existing with you.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. I had started that piece in 2017, I think. I don’t want to dismiss the moon, the moon’s, fine, but I was for real on a date with someone and it was going very well, and as it was going well, she was like, “Oh, it’s a full moon tonight. We should go look at the moon.” And me being foolish and slightly younger, I don’t want to say “Well, I was so young,” it was like four years ago, of me being foolish and slightly younger. And I was like, “Oh man, fuck the moon.” [chuckle] So I think that was also one of the propelling things from this piece, was back in 2017, I was significantly less in love with the moon than I am now. I appreciate it a bit more now in my older age.  SPEAKER:  You talk about Michael Jackson’s death and you talk about the night he died, how you ended up in the basement of a bar with a mass of people that came together to collectively dance to his music. But also, this felt like it broke your heart a little bit.  SPEAKER:  At the time, yeah. And one thing that I will say is that I’m someone who does not really listen to Michael Jackson anymore, and I don’t really have a relationship with Michel Jackson’s music anymore.  SPEAKER:  Intentionally?  SPEAKER:  Intentionally. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also don’t ever want to be dishonest about the way that I felt in a moment before this one, before like I evolved onto something else.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  Michael Jackson’s death, at the time it happened, yes, my politics on Michael Jackson have evolved in 2021 and before, honestly, maybe a couple of years after his death, they evolved. But at the time of his death, I think it was even less about him, the person, and more about this fresh absence in the childhood memories I had. And even more than that, it was kind of about the communal coming together of people.  SPEAKER:  And I don’t want to be dismissive of anyone’s death, but I do think that anyone with enough hits that could have brought people to that basement at Hampton’s on King and had us dancing all night… I don’t want to say it could have been anyone and be dismissive, but what I’m actually thinking about is not the death of Michael Jackson but the communal nature of songs that bring people together on a week night when they’ve got work the next day, that kind of thing.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. I thought about when I was about reading being in that basement dancing and you coming out and sweaty and the moonlight shining, and I thought about this construct from the philosopher Durkheim of collective effervescence. When he first witnessed something in churches and he’s like, “I don’t know what’s going on in here. It’s magic. It could be dangerous.” But then what he ended up calling it was collective effervescence. And I thought about, as you describe that room, I think there’s a line in there where you describe it as so packed you couldn’t raise an arm to wipe the sweat off your forehead. It was just wall-to-wall and dancing to this music, and in collective effervescence, and in community. It was so powerful.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. I was just thinking back to that night and the thought of that now, is so horrifying. [chuckle] The thought of being that physically close, but that was one of the wildest nights of my life, because it wasn’t even so much dancing, it was just moving what you could, how you could, where you could, and there was this communal understanding of, “We are going to be present on top of each other without complaint.” Yeah. And it wasn’t even… As romantic as I am, but it wasn’t a romantic thing. It was in this very hot summer, this very hot and draining summer, how do we steer ourselves beyond the grief into something higher? And how do we claw away at the foundation of grief and get some light to peek through?  SPEAKER:  That people often pick a path and you just refuse to pick a path here, is you do not usually separate the space between collectivity and grief either, do you?  SPEAKER:  No, I think it’s impossible for me to do.  SPEAKER:  It’s really, really beautiful. And it filled me with some grief about what’s happening this year for so many people who are having to mourn and grieve alone in a way that doesn’t feel like it matches our wiring.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, that’s been hard for me. And I think it’s been hard for a lot of my friends who live alone and who are alone to some degree, because I think that I count myself as someone who is almost required to believe in ghosts, or to believe in the type of haunting that manifests itself by subtle, or not so subtle revisits. Because otherwise, if I don’t believe in that, then I have to believe that as long as I am living, I am alone, apart from everyone I’ve loved who is no longer here.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  And I just refuse to believe that. I refuse to not see my mother in signs, or my dear friends who I’ve lost in the signs of my everyday living. And so there are some ways that I’ve gotten closer to these ideas in an attempt to understand myself as not entirely alone. And this means seeking gratitude in sometimes unhappy instances, like if I’m putting up a photo in a spot and I turn around and walk away and the photo falls and the glass breaks. So I’m always like, “That’s one of my homies telling me I need a better frame for that one.” I got a cheap frame and I put up the photo and then went to go do something else and the photo fell off the wall then broke, it’s like someone’s telling me, “This photo deserves better.” These kind of rationalizations make it for me so that grief is never individual, and so that my understanding of grief is always communal, but I also do understand mourning, the very physical, collective grieving process that comes with being near your friends. One of my oldest, closest friends in the city, who I love a great deal, had a child about a year ago. And last weekend, because it was warm enough, I met them at the park.  SPEAKER:  And we hadn’t seen each other in a long time. And we hung out for a few hours and it didn’t hit me until after I left the park. It fucked me up, because I was like, “Her child is walking and running around, and is curious about the world.” And the last time I saw her child, he was none of that. And it made me really confront this idea… Everyone talks a lot about how slow time is going, and I feel that. Definitely, time is going slow. But when I see real tangible impacts of things that are happening quickly that I am just missing, that feels like there are things spiraling down a drain that I can’t get back. That one of my closest friends in the world is in real time learning how to parent and I have no access to that part of her world, or the access I have is so limited.  SPEAKER:  And the next time I see her child he might be saying full words. Yeah, there’s something wild about that. There’s something that feels… I think I’m mourning the way that time feels both slow and fast at once, and I’m not sure which pace I’m more comforted by.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, and the markers are so real. Especially if you’re talking about a newborn to one, in language acquisition. And there’s a saying in parenting that’s coming up for me right now, as you describe this, so beautifully, which is, “The days are long and the years are short.” And it’s the paradox of, “Jesus, am I going to make it through this Wednesday today?” And then, “What the hell happened to September?”  SPEAKER:  Right. [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  It’s hard. I want to stay in this chapter for a minute. So you introduce us to Bill Bailey, who actually was the moonwalk creator, you talk about your mom and how you’d like to give her the moon. We go through Patti LaBelle. We talk about Billy Dee Williams, who was our Star Wars badass.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  And you loved that, didn’t you?  SPEAKER:  I did.  SPEAKER:  As a kid?  SPEAKER:  As a kid, I really loved Billy Dee Williams, yeah. Yeah. It’s weird, I’m not much of a Star Wars person now. I hope the fans of the franchise will forgive me. But I remember being a kid… And he also was the voice of Colt 45 malt liquor, which…  SPEAKER:  Oh yeah.  SPEAKER:  Back in the day when I was a kid on the school bus, those ads would play on the morning radio shows. And so I was so intensely familiar with his voice and the idea of cool as it presented itself in his voice. So yeah, yeah, he’s my guy.  SPEAKER:  And then you talk about Trayvon Martin and… This was the quilting and the weaving and the tapestry you made here just again, I was thinking about Billy Dee Williams’ character in Star Wars, and I was thinking about how he was really, I thought much more of a badass in some ways than Han Solo. He was just cooler guy, I thought, he just had a little bit more swagger than Han Solo. And he was good, and then all of a sudden I find myself weeping because after Trayvon Martin was murdered, you talk about the Internet and news being flooded with dehumanizing images of young Black men and Black boys. And dehumanizing in terms of looking dangerous, looking like the other, looking predatory, and we know that dehumanization is such a prominent tool of white supremacy. It’s just, let’s push the humanity, and then all of a sudden, we see what you would call and correct me if I’m wrong, a corrective photo, a reaction to the dehumanization, which is a younger Trayvon Martin. It’s a picture that I literally have the exact same picture of my son. It’s a field trip picture, right? Can you tell us more about that?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, I think I gravitate towards the Experience Aviation photo because it’s a field trip photo and because it’s a photo that I took as a kid in some degree, not at Experience Aviation, but at something like that. But I also wanted to complicate this idea that that photo was the corrective, when for me, the photos that were actually Trayvon Martin being Trayvon Martin doing anything while living were not in need of any correctives, right?  SPEAKER:  Right, God, yes.  SPEAKER:  There are photos of me with my middle finger up in my teens and those are photos that are me, again, performing a version of myself for a lens that I’m not ashamed of now and was not ashamed of then. And so untangling this idea of respectability from the image and the role respectability plays in the perception of images, I felt like there was a way to talk about America’s response and desire for these corrective photos despite Trayvon Martin not living a life long enough… His life was taken from him before he got to complicate any of his past selves.  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  And I think that that is something… The fact that I’ve gotten to live long enough to get to complicate my past selves is a real generosity and something that I hope that I’ll continue to get to do. But Trayvon Martin is among a lot of young Black folks who did not get that opportunity.  SPEAKER:  I’m just having a thought right now for the first time about something I’ve never thought about, which is the privilege of integration. I definitely know that’s not hard to imagine. I have pictures of me flipping somebody off with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth, and I have all kinds of things from my past. Luckily a generation, not caught on film mostly but I have the privilege of integration. I have the privilege of living long enough to create a hole, which I’m not actually interested in without that girl and Doc Martin flipping people off, to be honest with you, that she’s part of me. But the privilege of integration, it just comes from freaking living long enough.  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. I have a quote and a question… I have 400 other things, but I know time is important and you’ve been so generous with yours. There’s a quote on page 133-134, and I’m reading from the advanced uncorrected proofs. But do you by any chance have that in front of you?  SPEAKER:  No I do not have a physical copy of the book. [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  Okay.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, I’ve not seen it yet. I’m still rooting for a chance to get one soon.  SPEAKER:  Okay, so can I read this quote to you?  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  From this book that just takes my breath away. “I don’t want to go to the moon, but I do want to go to the place where Black dreamers stare at the moon and remark loudly about the signs and stars in a summer that feels as endless as those old summers, which pulled me from the paltry responsibilities of youth. The planet within the planet. People dance in space suits and young Black boys fire rockets above the trees and they always come back down in one piece and sure we’ll crack some malt liquor for the drinking folks, I guess. For as long as there is a future, there will be Black people in it, hopefully surviving in even newer and better ways than we are now. Circles of light opening their wide arms to briefly take our bodies, somewhere higher. It will appear spectacular to anyone who isn’t us.”  SPEAKER:  You’re a better reader of my book than I am. I should have you do the audio book.  SPEAKER:  No, I don’t know. I mean, I can’t get through that without having a hard time.  SPEAKER:  I think a lot about… In terms of the last line, I think all the time about how I always believe, Sun Ra. When Sun Ra would read interviews about Sun Ra talking about how he went to space. I believe when Black folks insist that they have seen something that the rest of the world hasn’t seen, or when they say they’ve been somewhere the rest of the world can’t fathom going, I almost require that level of belief, much like I require a belief in ghosts and the unseen. I require a pathway that leads to a salvation that perhaps cannot be found in the present state of the world because I am so frequently dissatisfied with the present state of the world. And so that dissatisfaction does not allow me to only imagine that long-standing salvation or joy can come in an earthly form until I see some evidence otherwise. And so there are ways that I think… And everyone I know, I feel like so many Black folks I know, just matter-of-factly believe and understand that to be true.  SPEAKER:  I joke about my pal Madison in the beginning of that piece. And again, I don’t know much about astrology. I would like to know more about astrology, but also would not like people to send me a bunch of emails asking me astrology questions. [chuckle] But…  SPEAKER:  Fair.  SPEAKER:  I think about my friend Madison, there’s something about her joyful and over-eager investment in astrology that feels like it is born from an other worldly place. She’s just one of many folks I have who are like this, but her pursuit of wanting to know everything about your birth time and all that type of shit is purely a pursuit of desiring to understand how you relate to the world in the way you do, and how she can better relate to your relating to the world. And there’s a real generosity in that, which is why I am slowly crawling towards a better understanding of astrology because I think there’s some real generosity in it.  SPEAKER:  I agree, and it’s maybe born of the desire to want to really see people and be seen by them.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, yeah.  SPEAKER:  I’m telling you people are like, “You’ve got to watch Hanif’s time,” because I have seven pages of questions. But before we go to the rapid fire, which I cannot wait, I was like, “I’m going to sneak in six extra questions for the rapid fire,” they’re like, “No, that’s just cheating.” Maybe we can make a semi-commitment to talk again…  SPEAKER:  I would love that.  SPEAKER:  After the book is out. I would love that too. Okay, you’re a cultural critic and you are a music lover, you’re a music critic, you’re a music writer. Are all those things true, that I just said?  SPEAKER:  Yeah, for sure.  SPEAKER:  Okay. And I’m thinking about Dave Chappelle. I’m thinking about what you write about Whitney Houston. I’m thinking about things that I see every day in the culture today, and here’s my question for you. Somehow it’s about the word performance and I wonder if it’s what you had to interrogate around it. Does Black art change in any way in purity or authenticity or integrity when it brings not just a Black audience, but specifically a white audience? The two questions I have, is one, does something happen when Black art is consumed by more than Black people, and the second question I have is, Jesus, is there anything that white people did not commodify, appropriate, or steal and call their own in music? I mean, really.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, the answer to the second one is no.  [laughter]  SPEAKER:  That’s the easy answer.  SPEAKER:  Okay.  SPEAKER:  The first question is a little bit tougher because I think that the best art I make is concerned with Black people and the kind of ability for some Black people to see themselves in the work, or at least find a path to see themselves in the work, and that’s it. Now, I’m also acutely aware that when I release the work into the world, I don’t have any control over it, and I don’t have any control over who else is seen in it, and I’m also not saying no one else is allowed to be seen in this work. I’m just not overly concerned. I’m not overly concerned with audience in general, but if I think of myself as writing to an audience who already understands the nuances of what I am saying, then I feel like I’m doing my best writing. For example, in the Spades piece, I wasn’t going to explain spades or the movements of spades too explicitly, because it’s like, “Well, I’m writing to an audience who know spades enough or have some kin folk who know enough about spades to get them through this.” I’m so bad at these questions, I’m someone who genuinely doesn’t consider audience a lot when I write.  SPEAKER:  I love that.  SPEAKER:  Because I’m so anxious, it’s not because I’m immensely still that compartmentalizing or because I’m self-righteous or whatever, it’s because I have such bad anxiety that I simply cannot consider audience.  SPEAKER:  As a cultural critic and even as a music critic, is it not about the ability of art to transcend to different audiences? Is it about big systems and machines trying to change the artist to appeal to white audiences?  SPEAKER:  Right, it’s always about the machinery, right?  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  It’s most often about the machinery. It goes back to Black soul artists recording songs and then white artists being put on the cover of the records. There’s always a machinery that is interested in making Blackness more palatable for an audience, which leads to profit and that is perhaps the bigger issue for me.  SPEAKER:  I don’t know how to ask this question, but I’m curious about what you think. The consumption of Black art without the investment of understanding Black lived experience.  SPEAKER:  Yeah, it’s like you want the art but don’t want to engage with the humanity.  SPEAKER:  Oh God, yes.  SPEAKER:  You want the idea of the person but not the person, yeah.  SPEAKER:  Tarana Burke and I are working on a project together right now, and part of the introduction of this anthology is a conversation between us and she said something that I thought was so powerful. She said, “I’m not interested in any anti-racism work that doesn’t fully value, honor, and love the fullness of Black humanity.”  SPEAKER:  Great. Yeah.  SPEAKER:  And I think there’s something powerful there. Okay. You ready for the rapid fire questions?  SPEAKER:  I am.  SPEAKER:  Fill in the blank. Vulnerability is…  SPEAKER:  Vulnerability is most often me attempting to not simply revel in the fact that I am capable of feeling large things, but instead thinking of a way that my capability to feel things can serve someone other than myself.  SPEAKER:  That would be an example of showing out I’m just… I just want to say…  [chuckle]  SPEAKER:  Okay. That was beautiful. Okay. Two, you, Hanif, are called to be very brave, but your fear is real, you can feel it in your throat. What’s the very first thing you do?  SPEAKER:  I say a little prayer to my ancestors asking for guidance.  SPEAKER:  What is something that people often get wrong about you?  SPEAKER:  You know what, I’m going to say this here, people think that… So I have a very rigorous skin care routine that I take very intensely and people think that I did not come to it on my own. People are always like, “What ex-girlfriend showed you that?” Or whatever. I want to be clear and say, I am the architect of my own skin care routine.  [laughter]  SPEAKER:  Okay, you’re the architect of your own skin care. You did your own research and everything?  SPEAKER:  Oh, yeah.  SPEAKER:  You’re not a TikTok recommendation? Nothing? Just…  SPEAKER:  No, yeah. I take it seriously, yeah.  SPEAKER:  Okay, do you share it with people who ask?  SPEAKER:  Depends. I do because I believe in karma, but for example, I updated it because I saw a dude in the grocery store this summer, and even with the mask on, I could tell he had great skin. I was kind of like, man, “That skin looks great. Tell me what’s the deal.” And he just gave me some recommendations. So I do believe in paying it forward. If people ask, I do share.  SPEAKER:  Wow, okay, the last TV show that you binged and loved.  SPEAKER:  Oh, Money Heist on Netflix. There’s a new season coming. I’m very hyped for it.  SPEAKER:  Okay, favorite movie.  SPEAKER:  I don’t have one of all time, but I will say that my favorite movie today is Moonlight because I just re-watched it a couple of days ago and it was as good as I remembered.  SPEAKER:  Yeah. Beautiful movie. God. Favorite meal.  SPEAKER:  Well, now I mostly just eat salmon in various forms because I don’t know, I’m in a salmon phase. I’m also trying to eat slightly healthier, and so I am mostly just making various salmon dishes.  SPEAKER:  What’s your side dish?  SPEAKER:  Broccoli right now. This is very boring, but broccoli, broccoli is like a vegetable I can really get behind.  SPEAKER:  Do you do anything special with it? Roast it?  SPEAKER:  Oh yeah, I roast it.  SPEAKER:  Boil it? Are you an air fryer guy?  SPEAKER:  No. I’ve heard stories, but I’m a little afraid to jump in.  SPEAKER:  No, you need to go, you need to go, and you can put your salmon and your broccoli in the air fryer, get this crispy skin salmon, the kind of charred edge broccoli, and you will thank me later.  SPEAKER:  Alright, I’ll do it.  SPEAKER:  Okay, a concert you’ll never forget.  SPEAKER:  I saw Big K.R.I.T play his hometown in Mississippi, and that was really emotionally affecting weirdly. It was like before he got very big. And there’s something about seeing an artist play in their hometown while they still feel like they belong to the hometown.  SPEAKER:  Yes.  SPEAKER:  I had these experiences with The Black Keys in Akron too. So they just always come to mind.  SPEAKER:  What’s on your nightstand?  SPEAKER:  Crystals, some black tourmaline, which is also on my desk, the book  The Last Time I Saw Amelia Earhart  by the poet Gabrielle Calvocoressi, the book  Inheritance  by Taylor Johnson. And also, I have this coin holder shaped like a leaf that I put a lot of random things in, so whatever is randomly in that thing.  SPEAKER:  Perfect. Give us a snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that gives you true joy.  SPEAKER:  I don’t necessarily love working out, but I love how I feel in the moments after I work out. I talked about in the book, but it’s true, I love walking into the sun after sweating.  SPEAKER:  God, you wrote something so descriptive, I just have to stop for a second and say, where you’re hot and you’re sweaty and you go outside and there’s that night wind that just gives you that goosebumps feeling, ah, I love that feeling. Tell me one thing you’re deeply grateful for right now in your life.  SPEAKER:  My dog Wendy.  SPEAKER:  Wendy?  SPEAKER:  Yeah.  SPEAKER:  That’s a really cute dog name. Alright, we asked you to give us five songs. We make a mini mixtape for all of our guests on Spotify, and we asked you for five songs you couldn’t live without. So SPEAKER, what do these five songs say about you in one sentence? “Knocks Me Off My Feet,” by Stevie Wonder, “Pirate Jenny,” by Nina Simone, “Are You Leaving for the Country,” by Karen Dalton, “Stand by Me,” by Tracy Chapman, and “Triumph,” by Wu-Tang Clan.  SPEAKER:  Those songs signal that I am consistently terrified, but relentlessly optimistic.  SPEAKER:  Thank you so much for putting your art into the world. Thank you for  A Little Devil in America . It took my breath away.  SPEAKER:  Thank you.  SPEAKER:  And thank you for talking to us on the podcast.  SPEAKER:  Of course. Thank you for having me. We’ll do it again sometime.  SPEAKER:  I would love it.  SPEAKER:  Cool.  [music]  SPEAKER:  What can you say about this conversation? What can you say about this incredible poet, writer, music critic, historian? I always think about this time when I was with my therapist and we were talking about vulnerability, and I said, “Oh my God, vulnerability is just excruciating.” And she said, “And it’s exquisite.” And I just keep thinking about that paradox as I reflect on this conversation, the tension of something that’s both exquisite and beautiful and excruciating, and I just believe that Hanif’s unwillingness to choose between the things that make life full and great, the grief, the gratitude, the love, the rage, the beauty, the horror, that’s where the genius happens, that’s where the miracle grows.  I’m so glad that y’all got to join us for this conversation. Thank you. You can find all of Hanif’s information on the episode page on brenebrown.com. His website is www.abdurraqib.com. A-B-D-U-R-R-A-Q-I-B.com. His Instagram and Twitter are both @N-I-F, as in Frank, M-U-H-A-M-M-A-D. And his podcast is on Sonos.  SPEAKER:  You can just go to Sonos playlist and look up Object of Sound. Just a reminder that all of our episodes have pages on brenebrown.com where you can find the links. You can get  A Little Devil in America: Notes in Praise of Black Performance  everywhere you buy books. We love the indie-owned book stores, they’re our faves. I think just do yourself a favor and sit down with this book, a warm cup of tea, maybe a little sunlight on your face, and turn yourself over to this writing. Grateful to have these conversations, grateful for this listening community. Y’all stay awkward, brave and kind.  Unlocking Us  is a Spotify original from Parcast. It’s hosted by me, SPEAKER.

       " ' Transcript   SPEAKER:  Hi, everyone. I’m Bren é  Brown, and this is  Unlocking Us .  Unlocking Us  is now officially only available on Spotify, so welcome to my Spotify home, everyone. I’m excited. They have built a beautiful new hub for the podcast, for our music. I really appreciate the warm welcome from the entire Spotify team. I know for many of you that download on Apple, you’re like, “Oh, does this mean a new app, and is it going to cost money, and is this going to be hard?” You can download the app. You can listen for free. I hope you join me. This community is an important thing to me, and I’m grateful that we are learning together, unlearning together, and walking together, and I appreciate this shift. I know change, especially right now when there’s so much shit going on in the world, is not always easy, so I appreciate you coming to Spotify with me.    SPEAKER:  I’m so excited about this episode. I am talking with SPSPEAKERKER, who is the host and producer of  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man . It’s a web series about racism. It’s just basically a human conversation that is open and uncomfortable and urgent and necessary. He has released an incredible book with the same name,  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man . This book is a manifesto, a mandate, a playbook. It’s generous. It’s full of love. It’s got incredible stories in it. He takes on just random questions from white folks, just—any question that he hears over and over, he takes it on. He gives us a historical understanding of the question in the answer. He asks us to get uncomfortable with him as he delves into what it means for culture today, and he invites us to walk the talk about our beliefs. It really is just smart, important, and real answers for real questions.    SPEAKER:  I don’t know if you know this about SPSPEAKERKER, but he is also a Fox Sports analyst and former NFL player and former Longhorn from the University of Texas. So you will hear all about his incredible book,  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man . We’ll dig into that, and I might even sneak in a question about the ’21–’22 UT football season. What a powerful learning, unlearning, and relearning episode. I’m glad you’re here with us today. Thank you.    SPEAKER:  In June 2020, SPSPEAKERKER launched a video series titled  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man , which opened a virtual conversation with white America about race, racism, and educational and economic inequality. The series has been a huge success, debuting with over 22 million views across social media platforms and garnering widespread media coverage. On November 10, Emmanuel’s book,  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man , launched. It’s found its way on to the  New York Times  bestseller list, where it still is comfortably sitting, which just—a book we all need.    SPEAKER:  Let me tell you a little bit about Emmanuel. After earning his undergraduate degree in sports management in 2012, he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns. He was then traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2013, where he spent most of his career. While in the NFL, Emmanuel spent offseasons at the University of Texas in Austin to earn his master’s degree in sports psychology. In 2016, he left the football field and picked up the microphone to begin his broadcast career. In 2018, Emmanuel was promoted within ESPN, where he served as the youngest national football analyst and was named a 2018 Forbes “30 under 30.” In 2017, he and his family’s nonprofit organization, Living Hope Christian Ministries, raised enough funds to build a hospital in rural Nigeria. Let’s jump into this conversation.    SPEAKER:  So welcome to  Unlocking Us , Emmanuel. I’m so excited to have this conversation.    SPSPEAKERKER:  Bren é , it’s been far too long. Like I said before you started recording, we run in the same circles, went to the same university, both bleed burnt orange–ish, so it is great to finally connect with you. I’m honored. I genuinely am honored.    SPEAKER:  I feel the same way. And I’ve got to tell you—let me tell you what  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man has meant to me. I have a call in to my son’s school that I will help pay for everyone to get this book. I just want to dig in. C an we dig in?     SPEAKER:  Can I ask a question? I only have one question. That’s it, if I may. When did you first see either the book or an episode and how? I’m always very intrigued, because this was just little old me that recorded something by myself in a room. The next thing you know, I’m getting calls from McConaughey, Oprah, and now, I’m talking to Bren é  Brown. So how did you first hear about the book or see an episode, if you recall?    SPEAKER:  I think I followed you and your brother on social.    SPEAKER:  That’s possible.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, and I think that’s the first thing I saw was the video in the very early stages, so I’ve been a follower from the beginning, and you know, I said a couple of times, this should be a book. This should be a book.    SPEAKER:  I love it.    SPEAKER:  This is a book.    SPEAKER:  And now it is a book.    SPEAKER:  Now it’s a book, and it’s not just a book. It’s somewhere between a manifesto, a mandate, and a playbook, and it kind of oozes love and generosity. And it’s really different. You’re really different.    SPEAKER:  Thank you.    SPEAKER:  I’m going to ask you my first big question. Tell me your story.    SPEAKER:  That is a huge question.    SPEAKER:  It is.    SPEAKER:  I don’t like answering questions with questions, so I’m going to answer the question of “Tell me your story” in the way in which I interpreted it, rather than making you, like, tell me, “OK, what do you mean by tell me your story.” All right, great. SPSPEAKERKER’s story. Emmanuel is the son of Nigerian immigrants. Emmanuel was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and I went to this affluent all-white private school growing up. It’s called St. Mark’s School of Texas. All-boys school. Had to wear uniform, gray slacks, white button-downs. I was extremely awkward. I was never in class with girls, was never in class with women until I went to the University of Texas, so imagine me going from a classroom of 15 people, all guys wearing uniform, to a class of 300 people, women included. I was awkward. So at St. Mark’s School of Texas, you’re supposed to be, like, a N ational  Merit Scholar. There was a kid in my class who literally scored a perfect on the SAT and the ACT. Meanwhile, there’s, like, little old me. A person in the grade above me won at the National Spelling Bee. His winning word was “ pococurante .” His name:  Sai Gunturi.    SPEAKER:  So true story, I remember all of this. And so now there’s me at the school with a bunch of super geniuses, but I was 6’2″, 240 pounds, so I was like, “You know what? I guess I’ll play football.”   Interesting thing, I’ve realized and then didn’t realize the difference between color and culture. You’ll understand the tie here in a second. See, I’m Black by skin color, but cultured, I was  Nigerian . I grew up eating rice and stew, grew up eating goat meat, grew up eating different type of rice dishes. Black by skin color, but Nigerian by culture. Then, remember, I went to a predominantly white school, so I was white by culture. I had a huge identity crisis, because in middle school, I would often hear, “Emmanuel, you’re not even Black,” or, “Emmanuel, you don’t talk like you’re Black,” or, Bren é , my favorite, “Emmanuel, you’re like an Oreo, black on the outside, white on the inside.”    SPEAKER:  Because I guess I sounded too educated to be what my white colleagues perceived as Black, and so I was like, “Maybe I’m not that Black, I guess. I mean, my skin is pretty dark, but I don’t know, they’re telling me I’m not Black. Maybe I’m not Black.” So now I go to the University of Texas and am immersed in Black culture because I’m playing on the football team. This is back when Texas was good, by the way. Now let’s hope that they’re good again soon. I’m in Texas, immersed, fully immersed in Black culture. And it was weird, Bren é , because I get there and I’m like, “You know, these are my people. ”  It was kind of like this awakening moment. Play at the University of Texas; get my undergrad degree in sports management; go to the NFL; drafted to the Cleveland Browns; get my graduate degree—my master’s degree while in the NFL in sports psychology, still at the University of Texas—leave the NFL after four years and end up hosting my own show, Fox  Speak for Yourself ; four years later, which is last year, write a book,  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man ; and now I’m talking to Bren é  Brown. The end.    SPEAKER:  OK, I want to unpack some of this. So when you were at St. Mark’s, did you have to do a lot of shifting? Were your parents strict, conservative ?     SPEAKER:  Golly. Do you know Nigerians, Bren é ?     SPEAKER:  I do.    SPEAKER:   You must be a doctor. You must be a lawyer. You must be an engineer.   Like, you must be a doctor, lawyer, engineer. There is no other profession. My parents, it’s like, “You can’t date until you get married.” Like strict is an understatement. I don’t even know curfew. There’s no curfew because you’re not allowed to leave. What do you mean, leave? You don’t need a curfew if you don’t leave the house. Oh, man, my parents were extremely strict. My dad had his doctorate in psychology and is a marital counselor while also being a pastor, and my mom has her doctorate in nurse practitioning, so education was huge in our household. So I grew up in an extremely strict household. Now, to your point and question of shifting, the other term that people use is “code-switching,” right? Acting one way to somebody, acting another way to another. I didn’t really code-switch when I was younger, because I more so gravitated to my environment, right? Again, I was Black, but I was   white-cultured, and so I really just acted very white-cultured.    SPEAKER:  I hate, Bren é , when people say, “Oh, he’s Black but he acts white,” because what’s that mean? Or, “Oh, he’s white, but he acts Black,” because what’s that mean? Let’s break down what you’re trying to say. They act white- cultur ed. So I really acted very white-cultured, and the only time I had to switch is when I was in my Nigerian environments in which my Nigerian culture would come out, but I do way more code-switching as an adult than I ever did as a youth.    SPEAKER:  Wow. There’s a wonderful book called  Shifting , and it’s about Black women in America and how exhausting it is to constantly be assessing your environment, adapting to the environment, and then the systemic racism that underlies all of the need for code-switching and shifting. So when I was reading about you growing up, I thought, “Man, you are like trilingual.” Like, you really moved in and out. Were your parents—what role did religion play in your family growing up?    SPEAKER:  Everything. I think—well, first off, the reason I started my  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man  series—I think the reason it resonates and permeates is because I understand—Bren é , we have to do a better job collectively of speaking truth with grace and with love. And I understood that based upon my relationship with Jesus growing up in the church. Bren é , if we only speak true without any grace or love, it’s honest, but it’s so harsh it can’t be digested. It’s like having a meal with too much salt on it. It’s just too harsh. If you only speak with love and grace but no truth, then it’s superfluous. It’s almost like meaningless nothings. Like, yeah, that sounded sweet, but there’s no depth to it.    SPEAKER:  We have to—and I realize, just based on my own experience—and I believe that your experience is your expertise—based on my experience growing up in the church is trying to figure out how to speak with truth and grace, but having the omnipresent and ever-present love always abiding at all times. So that’s really the role I would say my faith played. I don’t really love religion. I don’t love that concept of religion, because we’ve taken religion in America and made it mean so many things. For me, it’s all about relationship. Like, what is your relationship with God? What is your relationship with Christ? Who do you call God? Who is God to you? Because as soon as you start talking about religion, that gets really weird based upon the history of Europe and religion in Europe, the history of America and religion in America. For me it’s all relationship-based.    SPEAKER:  Tell me about arriving in Austin, at UT. Where did you live? Did you live in the dorm with the players?    SPEAKER:  So my brother is one year older. For those listening and who will listen, my brother   Sam Acho ,  he was one year older than me, also went to St. Mark’s, also went to Texas, went to the NFL one year before me. So when I got to Texas, he had already laid a blueprint. I lived in the dorm for one year until he moved off as a junior into off-campus housing, and so Mack Brown, the head coach at the time, College Football Hall of Fame, he kind of pardoned the two-year rule so I could go live with my brother. But Texas was an eye-opener. I mean, remember, I didn’t go out in high school. I went to an all-boys school. And so I’m on campus, now, like, “Wait a second. They have long hair. Wait a second. These classrooms are gigantic.” It was a crazy, eye-opening experience for me, but I adjusted and adapted quickly.    SPEAKER:  Did your brother look after you?    SPEAKER:  Definitely, definitely, but more than looking after me with words, he looked after me with actions, and so he—I believe that your action speaks so loud I can’t hear what you’re telling me, and so he won the Academic Heisman. Smartest player in college football, double major at McCombs business school, which is held in high esteem, again for those listening. Drafted in the fourth round, all while maintaining, like,  a 3.6 GPA . So he set the bar so high that even if I got close to the bar, I would end up in good territory, and so that’s really how he looked after me indirectly.    SPEAKER:  By example. That’s beautiful. Tell me the birth story of  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man .    SPEAKER:  The question of the hour.    SPEAKER:  Tell me how you breathed life into this. Tell me where it came from.    SPEAKER:  Because it is you, I will give you all the hidden details that I rarely express and I didn’t even express in my first book, but one day I will probably share. So let’s go back to the end of May 2020. I, a Black man, have just seen someone who looks like me, George Floyd, a Black man, be murdered by police, and so, Bren é , I was heartbroken. I was devastated. I was in utter dismay. I’m walking around my house, true story, in Austin, Texas, and I’m like,   “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to feel. Should I cry? Should I scream? Should I sleep?” I don’t know what to do, but, Bren é , the sports in me has taught me, “Emmanuel, don’t complain about a problem unless you’re going to submit a solution.”    SPEAKER:  See, Bren é , if I realize after looking in the mirror, “Oh, I don’t like my physique,” well, guess what? I’m going to go work out. Because I’m not going to complain about a problem unless I can figure out a solution. So I said—this is what I’m going to do, Bren é  Brown. I realized the disconnect in our society is there’s a language barrier, and how did I realize that? Because I grew up with all white people, and then I spent my adulthood with predominantly Black people, and although we all speak English in America, that English is translated differently based upon the culture you grew up in.    SPEAKER:  After George Floyd was murdered, I go to my white friends ’  house—Brogan, Russell, Brandon, Ashley, two couples that live next door to each other. Before walking into their house, I have to gather myself. “Whoosah,”   I said, because I was very upset. I was very angry. I walked in. They’re, like, “Emmanuel, what’s going on? ”  I said, “Sit down. We’ve got to talk.” They said, “Are you OK? I said, “No, I’m not. Why do white people, police officers, why do they still feel as though Black people are threats, even if they’re not threatening in the moment?” They’re like, “What do you mean?” We started talking about George Floyd. They said, “Well, Emmanuel, what’s a solution?” I said this, Bren é , I said, “We have to expose my white brothers and sisters to more Black people. Proximity breeds care. Distance breeds fear. We have to expose my white brothers and sisters to more Black people.”    SPEAKER:  My white friend, he said this, dear friend of mine, I’ve known him for 10 years. He said, “Well, Emmanuel, how?” He’s a religious man. I said, “You can go to Black church.” This is when I realized I had to have conversations, because his response, Bren é , he said, “I thought Black church was your thing.” I said, “This is it.” Because this is a white friend of mine, who I’ve known for 10 years—we’ve gone to church together, we’ve gone to church separate locations, and he didn’t realize the jurisdictions or lack thereof of Black spaces. So I said, “We’ve got to have conversations.” I said, “Black church isn’t my thing. I went to a church in Austin, a predominantly white church called Austin Stone.” I said, “I go to white church all the time.” He said, “That’s not white church. That’s just church.”    SPEAKER:  Bren é , I said this. I said, “To you, it’s not white church, because you’re white. See, to you, America isn’t white, because you’re white. So when you walk outside, everything you see typically reflects you back to you, but when I walk to a restaurant, a nice restaurant, a five-star steakhouse, I’ll look around trying to find other Black people just to be like, ‘Man, I’m glad you made it too.’ When I walk in the church, I’ll look around for the Black people, just to be like, ‘It’s good to see you here. I wonder what brought you.’”    SPEAKER:  So after that, Bren é , I said, OK, I got to have a conversation because there’s a language disconnect. I said this: I’m going to get three white people together, three black people together, we’re going to sit around a table. We’re going to have a fish bowl that’s going to have questions in them. The white people are going to pull out the question, read it, and let the Black people and the white people discuss. Problem, Bren é , we’re in the middle of a pandemic and you can’t get people together.    SPEAKER:  And so my friends were like, “Hey, I love the idea, but I’m in Dallas, I’m in Miami, I’m in Austin, I can’t travel.” I said, “OK, I’ll do it myself.” This is where things get interesting.  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man , that is a title. It is not “Uncomfortable M onologue  With a Black Man.”   The first episode was never to be recorded by myself. I called a sweet friend, she was going to drive down from Dallas to Austin to record it with me. She did drive down, three hours from Dallas to Austin, Interstate 35, straight shot to record it with me. We rehearsed it for 24 hours. We went and we got Thai food. We rehearsed it in front of her mother, who’s a sweet history teacher, but over the course of the night, she had a change of heart and she just realized, you know what, maybe she shouldn’t do it.    SPEAKER:  So I wake up the next day, an hour, two minutes, Bren é , before I’m supposed to be in studio, 11 a.m. on Sunday—it’s now 9:58. And she has tears in her eyes. “Emmanuel, I can’t do it. It’s not right. I just—they don’t want to see me. They want to see you.” I’m pleading with her like,  “ No, no, no, no, no, I haven’t rehearsed this by myself. I desperately need you, just—we don’t even need to dress up, no makeup. I need you.” “It’s not right, it’s not right.” I said, “OK, I’ll do it by myself.” That’s why in episode number one, I ask the question and then I answer the question because I was never supposed to ask the question.    SPEAKER:  Last little tidbit, which I don’t tell often, is I’m walking into the door at 10:48 a.m.—remember, call time was 11 a.m. for me to record this. I get a text on my phone. With my left hand I check my text. With my right hand I open the door. It was a friend of mine, a Black friend of mine. She says, “Emmanuel, I really don’t like this idea that you’re going to do. White people didn’t educate Black people as to how to assimilate into white culture. Why do we need to educate white people how to assimilate into our culture?” I simply responded, “I’m going to go as God leads.” I’m inside this all-white room with my best friend and Olympic gold medalist—her name is Morolake—and a videographer, a wedding videographer, people. This was not like some high-definition project.    SPEAKER:  This is like wedding videographer. It is three of us. Videographer, his wife, my best friend, Olympic gold medalist. True story, Bren é  Brown. I put my head down. I count down from three. I say three, two, and at one, I open up my eyes. I stare into the lens of the camera, and for 9 minutes 27 seconds, we do not cut the camera. It was not edited. It was not fixed. It was not critiqued. It was nothing. After that, I post the video the next day, and within five days, we have 27 million views, and  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man  began.    SPEAKER:  Wow. I want to ask you about a theme that I saw throughout the book that starts with this story, actually, a story of sometimes aloneness and isolation in this work, and then a story of resilience in pursuing anyway, despite rising and walking alone sometimes when you have to. Have you had that experience?    SPEAKER:  Absolutely. Now that will be my next book, which has not been written yet, but yes. And in my mind, I am very aware of two concepts. One concept is a concept of   even when everybody else kind of leaves you, you got to go anyway. Like if you are convicted about a message, if you’re convicted about a word, if you’re convicted about a movement or a moment, go with your conviction. You have to understand: After my friend had her change of heart overnight, I was scared. I did not eat breakfast that morning because I was so nervous. She had a change of heart. I texted another one of my white friends. I said, “Hey, can you please come do this with me? I just need you to sit here and ask questions.” He’s like, “My 2-year-old daughter is teething. I can’t do it.” I’m like, “Oh, I got to do it myself.”    SPEAKER:  Now, Bren é , after I still have the confidence to move past that, I’m walking into the building, and now my Black friend texts me out of the blue. Hadn’t talked to her in a week, since I originally told her of the idea, and says, “Hey, I don’t think you should do it.” Now I’m getting deterred every which way, but I said, “You know what, I have to do it. This isn’t a matter of me. This is bigger than me. This moment is bigger than me. These words are bigger than SPSPEAKERKER.” There is a language barrier. Our problem is communication and lack thereof and lack of understanding, and so I had to speak.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, bigger than you.    SPEAKER:  Absolutely.    SPEAKER:  All right, you take on some really tough questions in this book. You talk a lot about the power of language. You take on questions like, Do we use the term “Black” or “ African  American”? Implicit bias, white privilege, cultural appropriation, angry Black men, the n-word, the n-word in music, and why do I have to not say it when my Black friend’s saying it and the Black artist is singing it, systemic racism, reverse racism, which is such a weird concept. I want to talk to you about a couple of these topics, but before we jump in, what has been the most difficult thing about hearing the questions? Has it been painful and hard?    SPEAKER:  The most difficult and the most painful — I was doing a show with our mutual friend Oprah for an  Oprah C onversation , for Apple TV, and I’m sitting there and I’m answering questions from 10 different people, just rapid-fire, non-rehearsed. I don’t know what they’re going to ask. I don’t have a prepped answer. One person chose not to be on camera, Bren é , because of the question they were going to ask.    SPEAKER:  Red flag.    SPEAKER:  Red flag already. They said, “Emmanuel, the Holocaust was both more recent and more deadly than slavery, but Jewish people have managed to recover. How come Black people can’t recover?”    SPEAKER:  Oh.    SPEAKER:  And mind you, I’m sitting there—this is the second time I’m now talking to Oprah, because the first time was via FaceTime—this is now kind of a live format, and I have to kind of guard my reaction, because I was like, what in the world? That was difficult to hear because of the ignorance that was interwoven in that question. I think that’s a very ignorant question. Now, I was glad it was asked, because the only way we can get past our ignorance—the only way we can get past our na ï vety—is if we have these conversations, as uncomfortable as they may be. And so I submitted my answer in very simply—it is easier to judge someone based off their skin color than it is to judge someone based off of a belief, right?    SPEAKER:  And now obviously, the Holocaust was way more complicated than just a belief system. There was the whole blond hair, blue eyes, being extremely supreme, etcetera. But in America, in 2021, you can look at somebody just off their skin color from 100 yards away and like, “Oh, they’re Black,” and judge them before you ever know what it is that they believe or what it is that they stand for, before you ever know their sexual orientation, before you ever know anything else, and so we still judge based off the easiest thing that is to judge, which is skin color. Simple reply. But that was the toughest thing that I’ve had to hear up until this point.    SPEAKER:  You know, it’s painful too, about that question for me, is how ultimately comparative suffering only benefits white supremacy. Do you always keep your cool?    SPEAKER:  Absolutely.    SPEAKER:  No, really. Do you really? Like you never lose your stuff? Like you never go—    SPEAKER:  No, I don’t have that luxury. You see, this is what’s funny, and I’m glad you asked that question so genuinely. Bren é , I’m 6’2″, 240 pounds, and I’m Black. I don’t have the luxury of getting mad, you know what I mean? I was telling people the other day, I said, when I’m cold walking outside, Bren é , I don’t have the luxury of putting my hood on, because to be a Black man wearing a hood is to be perceived as a threat.  George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin —you remember Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin. Society has told me that I don’t necessarily have certain luxuries that other people have, and so I wrote a whole chapter, which you’ve already talked about, “The Mythical Me: The Angry Black Man.” I don’t have the luxury of getting upset even when I’m mad, because it’s what is called the Pygmalion effect, and I studied this in psychology. All it is is self-fulfilling prophecy, Bren é .    SPEAKER:  White person looks at SPSPEAKERKER, 6’2″, 240-pound Black man. So white person believes that SPSPEAKERKER is going to be angry, so SPSPEAKERKER now acts in a manner that can be perceived as angry. White person looks at Emmanuel, who she already believed to be angry, and says, “See, I told you so,” and the process is cyclical. That’s Pygmalion effect, self-fulfilling prophecy. So I don’t have the luxury of getting mad, and so I just take a beat, pause, smile, and answer the question.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, because we’re walking down Quad in Austin, right? And you’re coming toward me and you’re in a great mood. You’re walking to get some food somewhere, and I move over. I clutch my purse. I pull my daughter in a little bit closer to me. You respond with hurt. That shows up, and then I say, look, see, hostile.    SPEAKER:  Exactly, exactly, and—because that’s so ingrained in us. Even now, Bren é , I’ll be very honest. First time saying this, COVID has been tough for a few reasons, because I might try to work out outside before L.A. had crazy restrictions, and oftentimes, one, the world is just more predominantly white, particularly where I live, so I’m seeing more white people. They’ll run in different directions or run off the curb or run off the grass, and while it may be because, you know, “Well, he’s coming towards me,” even though I was 6 feet away, a part of me still feels the hurt of “I am Black, and so they’re moving because you’re a threat, not because of COVID, but just because of fear.”    SPEAKER:  So because the way in which my brain has been wired based upon my experience, I’ve caught myself three to four times over the last few months just being like—I’ll be very honest with you. I want to turn around and ask, “Hey, why did you do that?” I can’t, but I genuinely want to turn around and ask and be like, “Look, I was 8 feet away from you. Why did you beeline left? Is it because of COVID or is it—?” Anyway, I’m not going to go there, but it’s very hard. It can be hard to exist at times as a Black individual, regardless of money, regardless of fame, because your Blackness will trump that.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, you know, you say you don’t have the luxury. And I think that we’ll define that luxury as humanity—like what is the cost of denying people humanity? That’s humanity. And I think it is, I’m sure, compounded by the fact that you’re a big guy.    SPEAKER:  Exactly right.    SPEAKER:  First of all, I have to say your format of you take a question, then you say, “Let’s rewind,” and you look at history. You say, “Let’s get uncomfortable.” You talk real talk around what’s happening there and then talk it, walk it, put it into action. Man, I love this format. History teachers must be like, “Thank you.” Like, you give us history. So I want to talk about, and I’ll tell you why in a minute, but let’s start here. Your chapter on implicit bias. Here’s my well-loved and -worn book. This was a question that came in from Patrick. “What are some of the best ways to find and get rid of your implicit bias? ”  The chapter is called “What Do You See When You See Me?” Very much what we were just talking about, right, and you start with a story about Google’s rollout of its Photos app program.    SPEAKER:  How crazy is that, by the way?    SPEAKER:  Tell us the story.    SPEAKER:  I believe it was 2015. Google rolled out this photo application, and it would group individuals based upon—essentially like a face scan. But the problem was, their photo application was mislabeling Black people as gorillas. And so they hire the engineers and they went to try to search the functioning and the programming of the system, but they couldn’t figure out why it kept mislabeling Black people as gorillas, so they removed the gorilla label altogether. And that just made me wonder, Bren é , like, Wait, why didn’t it label white people as panda bears, right? How come only Black people are dealing with that kind of thing? And it’s just based upon programming bias, and it’s the society we live in, but that’s just so mind-blowing, that there was literally a photo application misidentifying Black people as gorillas.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, the reason why I want to ask you about this, about implicit bias, because I work in a lot of companies, Fortune 100 companies doing leadership work, and what I hear over and over is really scaring me. What I’m hearing is, “Data don’t lie, people lie, and algorithms are the answer to anti-racism.” But I keep saying, “But people program algorithms.”    SPEAKER:  Bingo.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, and if we don’t recognize the implicit bias in the developers and the programmers of the algorithm, the only thing the algorithm will do is scale racism and gender and everything else, like—    SPEAKER:  Bias and racism aren’t scientific and they’re not mathematical, and so we can’t get to a sum of zero based on some sort of calculation, because racism and bias are typically emotional, and that’s the issue and the problem at hand. The other thing that was so baffling to me—it wasn’t until somebody shared a section of my book—that my white friends didn’t realize Band-Aids, Band-Aids match white flesh. Band-Aids don’t match my flesh, and so the world we live in is just predicated upon bias, if you will. And it’s not because a Band-Aid is racist. It’s not because a Band-Aid is sexist. It’s not because a Band-Aid has a—but who created and why did they create and who did they create it for? That’s the kicker. Who is this created for? That’s why companies struggle. That’s why marketing campaigns, Bren é , struggle. That’s why social media managers struggle, because they’re putting out a tweet, but who are they putting out the tweet for and what lens is this campaign being created through? Who are these Band-Aids created with mind of? This Google photo application, who was in mind when it was being created? And that’s got to be the issue here.    SPEAKER:  Who are we serving?    SPEAKER:  Exactly.    SPEAKER:  I love—you start the chapters not only with these amazing chapter titles, but also with quotes, and I think it’s Nathan Rutstein: “Prejudice is an emotional commitment to ignorance.” Yikes. Man, that’s so good. OK, this is a question from Tracy. “My question is about the term ‘ reverse racism .’ It seems to me that it’s an oxymoron. Isn’t racism just racism, whether it’s white people hating Black people, Black people hating Latinos, Latinos hating Asians, Asians hating white people? Hate based on skin color or nationality, it’s just hate. Isn’t that racism?” Like this whole idea of reverse racism, like tell us how you walk folks through this.    SPEAKER:  Well, first off, I have to say and submit that reverse racism is not real. Racism is racism. Now, individuals can be racist. But in order for groups at large, for racism to exist amongst groups at large, I submit that there are three primary components: power, privilege, and prejudice. Power, privilege, and prejudice. And in America, Black people collectively, they do not have all three. Black people can for sure be prejudiced, no doubt about it. Some Black people can definitely have privilege, but their privilege is not because they are Black. I’m sure we will get to that later. But collectively Black people have no power in this country, not collectively. An individual Black person may have some power, but the group at large, Black people, don’t have power, privilege, and prejudice.    SPEAKER:  The example I submit in my book—when I was playing in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles, there was a huge 6’ 4″ , 300-pound defensive lineman, and for whatever reason, he would bully me. He’d make fun of me, Bren é , for this. He’d make fun of me for that. Then one day after practice, I just looked at him and I said, “You’re the worst teammate in the history of teammates.” And he just looked at me and he shut up. And think how silly it would be to say, “Well, Emmanuel, that’s being a reverse bully.” In the same manner, reverse racism just doesn’t exist.    SPEAKER:  People say, “Well, how come Black people get a Black History Month while white people don’t get a White History Month. ”  Every month is white history month. Because in America, we have always celebrated white culture, white accomplishments, white things, and Black people, we’ve never truly esteemed Black accomplishments. Barack Obama was a president. The reason he was the first Black president was because we ain’t never had no Black presidents. Kamala Harris is a vice president. The reason she is the first Black woman, first woman, first Black person to be vice president is because we ain’t never had no Black vice presidents. And so we have to shine a light on our firsts, because this country has never done so.    SPEAKER:  Can I tell you a story from UT that I think just—yeah, so I took a course—I wonder if you took this course. I took a course from Dr. Ruth McRoy. She taught a class called the Black Family, and I couldn’t wait take this course, and she—probably the number one expert in the world on   trans-racial adoption, open versus closed adoption. I end up doing research for her for a semester. That’s where I fell in love with qualitative research. Well, I walk into this classroom and it’s probably 90% Black students taking this class on the Black family, and I’m there and I see a couple of my social work friends and I go sit with them. One’s black, one’s Latina, and we’re talking, and then here comes Ruth McRoy. She’s got a suit on. She’s just like—everyone knows about her.    SPEAKER:  And 10 minutes after the class starts, this white student comes in—“Excuse me, excuse me”— walks right in front of Dr. McRoy while she’s talking, and then finds a seat right next to me, and I’m like, “Oh God, don’t sit here.” Do you know what I mean? Just like, “No, no, no, don’t sit here.” And Dr. McRoy’s like going over the syllabus, and this woman raises her hand and she says, “I’ve got a question. Is this class racist just based on its existence?” And I just remember Dr. McRoy was like, “Say more.” And she said, “Well, what if I offered a class at UT called the White Family?” And Dr. McRoy said, “Interesting. Well, I’ll tell you, there’s 64 classes on the family at the University of Texas at Austin. Unless it says ‘Black’ in the title, it’s about the white family.”    SPEAKER:  I was like, and there you have it. It’s the privilege of invisibility. And I remember going home that night, and remember when we used to get—well, I’m older than you, by a ton, but we used to get a big printout of all the courses, and I remember going through that week of all the courses and it’s like, of course, all the research in these family courses are going to be done on white families. Of course all the studies are going to be about white families. It’s such a powerful thing to know that when the descriptor is missing, it defaults to the majority culture.    SPEAKER:  Correct.    SPEAKER:  If you and I were doing a qualitative research study together on these questions, what would be the theme or pattern that we would be able to identify? What would we see?    SPEAKER:  The primary thing that we would see is the complication or confusion around white privilege. We would see that a ton.    SPEAKER:  Say more about that.    SPEAKER:  There is such a visceral response to that word “privilege,” because when people hear “privilege,” they assume that they didn’t work for what they got, and people assume to hear “white privilege” is to hear that, well, your life hasn’t been hard, and to that I very much so submit that white privilege isn’t saying your life hasn’t been hard. It’s just saying your skin color hasn’t contributed to the difficulty of your life. As a white person, surely your life has been hard, because life is hard, but your whiteness isn’t what has made your life any more difficult. Whereas as a Black person, your Blackness has contributed to that difficulty.    SPEAKER:  I offer this example, Bren é . I recently received a celebrity card to go to a restaurant, and whenever you go to this restaurant, because of your celebrity card, you can eat there for free. It’s amazing. Order whatever you want—you swipe the card and you eat it for free.    SPEAKER:  That’s amazing.    SPEAKER:  It’s great. It’s fantastic. Because of my celebrity privilege, I have this card. Because all privilege is is immunity from certain punishment or special access granted to certain things. So because of my celebrity privilege, I have a card that grants me access to eat here for free. I don’t feel guilty about being a celebrity in someone’s eyes. The issue is, what do I do with that privilege? Bren é , on the back of the celebrity card, in fine print, it says, “You are allowed to throw a party for up to 100 people once a year with this card.” So what I did, I threw it for the homeless. I would hit up a Salvation Army shelter, or in Philadelphia, I’d throw it for the homeless.    SPEAKER:  Now, that’s not to toot my own horn. That’s to say this: To those that have privilege, my white brothers and sisters, don’t feel guilty about being white. That is dumb. So I say, use your privilege for the benefit of those that don’t have it, that don’t have the same privilege. That’s what I do with mine. And so when we talk about that through line of the questions of white privilege and privilege, I say, “Look, I have celebrity privilege at times. You can have CEO privilege. You can have able-bodied privilege.” When I was hurt playing in the NFL, I had to figure out, OK, is there going to be an elevator? Is there going to be an escalator? Are there going to be stairs? Is there a ramp? Because I didn’t have able-bodied privilege at that time.    SPEAKER:  So, so many of us have able-bodied privilege as well. We don’t have to calculate if there are going to be a stairs versus a ramp, an elevator versus an escalator. We just live our lives, and that is the biggest thing on and about white privilege, and I so desperately want people to understand, don’t feel guilty. Do something with it.    SPEAKER:  First of all, can I just say an amen? I mean, just so good and so clear. Like, your whole book is good and clear. Wow, does shame and guilt get in the way of good work, yes or no? Like the shame people feel about privilege gets in the way actually of people owning it and doing something productive with it.    SPEAKER:  Correct. And we have to realize shame and guilt typically lead to denial. And I’ve said this before. I’ll say it again: Denial —I use the acronym, denial spelled D-E-N-I-A-L, Don’t Even Know I Am Lying, right? And so many people don’t know they’re lying.    SPEAKER:  That is so good. Oh, my God, wait, I’ve been sober for 25 years, and no one said that in one of the 12-step rooms? Wait, you’ve got to, I mean, come on, you like—dang, this is a moment, and a learning moment. But say it again.    SPEAKER:  Denial, D-E-N-I-A-L, Don’t Even Know—obviously, play on words there—I Am Lying. Don’t Even Know I Am Lying. And you can’t fix a problem, Bren é , you don’t know exists. That’s what people have to realize. You can’t fix a problem you don’t admit exists. So as long as we stay in denial about our privilege, because of guilt or denial about our privilege, because of shame, we can’t fix the problem, and so that’s why I’ve always said, “Guilt doesn’t cause you to change. Love does.” Do your actions out of love, not out of guilt. I fed the homeless out of love. I didn’t feed the homeless like, “Oh, man, I get another free restaurant. I get another free meal. I hate this.” No, it was like, “You know what, I’ve been blessed. Let me be a blessing.”    SPEAKER:  My team and I have read through the book a couple of times. Have you been on the receiving end of any criticism from Black colleagues or Black friends around, “Look, we don’t need to take responsibility for this teaching. This is not our emotional labor.” Like—almost the text, like the text you received walking in that first day.    SPEAKER:  If you want to avoid criticism, you have to say nothing, do nothing, and be nothing.    SPEAKER:  Aristotle.    SPEAKER:  Obviously, like you, over the course of your career, I have received tons, not tons, but a fair amount of criticism. My criticism, though, is primarily, “Emmanuel, stop pandering to white people. These white people don’t care about you. These white people will never care about us. Stop begging white people for help.” My first episode, Bren é , I say if white people are the problem, white people must be a part of the solution. “Stop begging white people for help. You sound pathetic, begging a white man for help.” This, that, and the third.    SPEAKER:  And to that I’m just like, “Look, if somebody has their foot on your neck, you got to find a way to get their foot off your neck, so you going to ask them to? You can try to resort to violence, but one way or another, you have to find a way to get their foot off of your neck.” I realize that my white brothers’ and sisters’ hearts are now being open. They’re being soft and to receive—to want to change, to want to be. No white person alive right now owns slaves, hopefully. So if that’s the case, that there are some white people that may be in the lineage of slavery and things like that, but there also might be some white people that are ignorant. Bren é , let me say this if I may. We have to understand there are degrees of racism in our country like there are degrees of murder. I think I say this in the book. I do not recall, it’s been a lot.    SPEAKER:  You have first-degree murder that is premeditated, second-degree murder, heat of passion. Then you move down the rungs to involuntary manslaughter. It was not premeditated, but it still leads to death. I submit that so many white people in America right now fall under the rungs of involuntary racism. There’s not premeditated. You don’t own slaves. Rarely we see the crime of passion—George Floyd’s murder—but every day we see involuntary racism. “Emmanuel, you’re so intelligent for a Black man.” “Oh my God, you’re so pretty for a Black girl.” You see the involuntary racism. And that is what we have to do a better job of extinguishing, if you will.    SPEAKER:  When you’re talking about this, I keep thinking about a conversation I had with Ibram Kendi on the podcast where he said racism just rains down and rains down, and so many white people don’t even know they’re wet. One of the words that came up for my team when we finished reading this was, there is a generosity of spirit in this book. Were you raised like that?    SPEAKER:  Yeah, my parents did a phenomenal job, I think, and I say it in the acknowledgements, and I forget exactly what I said, but I said, my dad, he taught me how to speak and my mom taught me how to have compassion, and I think it’s that combination. Again, I saw my dad every Sunday stand in front of hundreds and at times thousands of people to deliver a message, but then my mom, I would go home and she taught me how to love, and so I was raised to figure out both how to speak in a manner in which people can understand, but then also how to love. We have to remember, Bren é , there’s a book, Malcolm Gladwell,  Outliers —I’m sure you’ve read it. I think I   got it from  Outliers , but maybe not.    SPEAKER:  And it talks about how some countries are receiver-oriented and some countries are speaker-oriented. And it’s my job, because I believe speaker-oriented—where it’s my job to make sure that Bren é  Brown understands what SPSPEAKERKER is trying to communicate. I’m not going to put the effort on Bren é  to understand. I’m going to make sure that I say it in a way that she can understand it. And so when I wrote this book, when I have my episodes, every time I speak, I try to do so to cater to the listener or to cater to the reader, because if I speak and you don’t understand, then what was the point of speaking? I spoke in vein. And that’s really how I wrote the book.    SPEAKER:  It’s interesting, it reminds me of Frederick Douglass and how he thought about it. He was maybe the greatest orator in our country ever, and he talked about the generosity of great speaking to land in the hearts and minds of people, right? I want to read this quote to you. It’s from your book, page 182. Is it weird when people read to you from your book?    SPEAKER:  Not at all. I haven’t gotten used to it yet.    SPEAKER:  “True allyship demands that it move from conversation into action. And that action will include risks. This isn’t the 1830s or the 1930s, the 1950s or 1968. But I won’t lie to you and say it’ll be easy. The risks might be something as small as a distant social media friend unfriending you. But it could be something more severe, like ostracism from an intimate friend group, job insecurity, public or private ridicule, friction with loved ones. Know that when you say you are an ally, you are saying that you are willing to risk your white privilege in the name of justice and equality for marginalized voices.”    SPEAKER:  It’s more powerful when you read it. I should have had you do the audio book. I’m going to make a note of that.    SPEAKER:  I don’t think so. I just think when you say you’re an ally, you’re saying that you’re willing to risk your privilege, your white privilege, in the name of justice equality for marginalized voices. And that willingness to risk, I guess maybe, would you say is the difference between performative allyship and real allyship?    SPEAKER:  Yeah, because—Bren é , it’s scary. I get it. Again, I grew up with white people. Love my white people like I love my Black people. I love all people. It’s scary, Bren é , to put yourself in the front lines of criticism. What do you—like, that’s scary. And when I say you lose your white privilege, if you are now white but marching with a sea of Black people, cops don’t have time to delineate. They about to punish you like they punish everybody else. Whereas if you were white marching with a sea of white people, oh, it’s going to be treated a little bit differently. So you lose that white immunity, and we’ve already said privilege is simply immunity or special access. I get that it’s scary, Bren é . Again, I told you,  Uncomfortable Conversations  was never supposed to be done by myself, so a part of me has to wond e r, like I wonder if my friend was a little fearful. It’s scary. That’s a lot of weight.    SPEAKER:  There’s a lot of judgment, and there’s a lot of people who are going to say, “You’re white. What do you even know about this? Your intentions aren’t even pure. You’re just trying to be like a white savior and the white savior complex.” It’s tough. And here’s the other thing, the last thing I’ll say on this note. We live in a world that judges people by their actions and not their intentions, and so there are so many white people that are well-intended, but they can’t necessarily execute the action in the manner in which they want it to parallel to the intention. And so as a result, they get backlash, even though they were well-intended, and so now my white brothers and sisters are scared to say anything because they don’t want to say the wrong thing. And it’s scary, because you can’t always say the right thing. I don’t always say the right thing and I live in Black shoes. So I do think that’s a big reason why people are scared to get into the fight, because it’s dangerous out there.    SPEAKER:  It’s such a powerful example of how there is no courage without vulnerability.    SPEAKER:  That’s good. That’s really good.    SPEAKER:  The willingness to show up and be seen and be heard when you can’t control the outcome, that’s really the definition of courage. And this is a book—every dang chapter you say,  “ Let’s get uncomfortable,” and I think that’s what healing is going to require, a big dose of courage and discomfort.    SPEAKER:  Healing and growth.    SPEAKER:  Yes.    SPEAKER:  And I fervently believe that you don’t grow unless you get uncomfortable. Like greatest things are birthed through discomfort. I’ll mention this, before ever playing in a football game, you got to go through four weeks of camp, training camp, grueling Texas sun with 12 to 15 pounds of gear on and cleats and wet shoulder pads. You go through all that for the reward. A woman goes through no small amount of labor pains to bring forth a child. We have to get uncomfortable to birth great things, but I’ll say this, it’s only uncomfortable until you do it a few times. That’s it. When I first moved to L.A., it was uncomfortable waking up at 5 a.m., trying to be up when everybody else wakes up, until you do it a couple of times. Training camp and practice, it’s uncomfortable until you become more acclimated. These conversations are only uncomfortable until we familiarize ourselves with having them.    SPEAKER:  Yeah, I always say that when you have them a couple of times, the discomfort doesn’t go away, but it shows up with grace, and grace is the whisper that says, “You can do this. You can get through this. We’ve done this before.”    SPEAKER:  All right, are ready for some rapid- fire questions?     SPEAKER:  Please.    SPEAKER:  I’m going to add an extra one because I got a football question for you that’s so important. OK, are you ready?    SPEAKER:  Let’s do it.    SPEAKER:  OK, number one. Fill in the blank. Vulnerability is—    SPEAKER:  Difficult.    SPEAKER:  Number two, you’re called to be brave, and I mean really brave, but your fear is real. You can feel it in your throat. What’s the very first thing you do?    SPEAKER:  Pray and breathe.    SPEAKER:  What is something that people often get wrong about you?    SPEAKER:  My intelligence.    SPEAKER:  What is the last TV show that you binged and loved?    SPEAKER:   Defending Jacob , phenomenal show.    SPEAKER:  OK. I haven’t seen it. Is it good? Do you recommend it?    SPEAKER:  Phenomenal. Well, I love that mystery type of stuff. It’s phenomenal.    SPEAKER:  OK. One your very favorite movies.    SPEAKER:   Bad Boys II ,  Oceans 11 . I could go on, but I’ll say those.    SPEAKER:  OK, I know who you are now. I see you. A concert you’ll never forget.    SPEAKER:  Crazy—and you know what, I got to say two. John Legend, it was intimate, but crazy enough, Taylor Swift.    SPEAKER:  I love it, both. OK, favorite meal. You can eat anything you want.    SPEAKER:  Let me go with pad kee mao, Thai food. Yeah.    SPEAKER:  Yes.  OK. What’s on your night stand?     SPEAKER:  Currently, my book, and nothing else.    SPEAKER:  I like it.    SPEAKER:  A light,  a lamp.    SPEAKER:  Minimalist.    SPEAKER:  I keep it simple.    SPEAKER:  Yeah. I have two last ones, but I’m going to have to ask you this one. How’s Steve Sark going to do at UT?    SPEAKER:  He’s hired a phenomenal coaching staff. To be a great head coach, you just have to be a great delegator of responsibility. As a result, it appears he will do well because of the staff he’s hired.    SPEAKER:  What’s wrong with our offensive line?    SPEAKER:  It’s hard for Texas to retain quality players on the offensive line because they typically leave early, as we’ve seen in the last four years—two players leaving early—so that’s really what I would say, and hopefully a new O- line coach.    SPEAKER:  OK, back to the script. OK, a snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that gives you real joy. Just like a Polaroid picture, a snapshot, what’s in it?    SPEAKER:  It would be me sitting in front of a grand piano playing and singing.    SPEAKER:  You play piano?    SPEAKER:  Yeah, I like that. I taught myself how to play in Texas in San Jacinto, in that dorm there.    SPEAKER:  I love it. OK, tell me one thing you’re deeply grateful for right now.    SPEAKER:  Listeners. I’m grateful that people are willing to listen to the words I have to say, regardless really of what I have to say. Everybody is just kind of waiting for me to say something. I’m grateful that people trust me enough to listen.    SPEAKER:  Beautiful. OK, we ask you for five songs you couldn’t live without. Here’s what you gave us. “Days of Elijah”  by Donnie McClurkin;  “ Imagine Me ”  by Kirk Franklin;  “This Time”  by John Legend;  “All of Me” by John Legend; and  “ You Made a Way” by Travis Green. In one sentence, what does this mini-mixtape, this playlist, say about SPSPEAKERKER?    SPEAKER:  It says that SPSPEAKERKER loves love because SPSPEAKERKER has received the ultimate love.    SPEAKER:  That demands an amen. Very beautiful.    SPEAKER:  I’m like there it is, there’s one through line. SPSPEAKERKER loves love because he’s received the ultimate love.    SPEAKER:  Man, very few people could do that that quickly. They give me those sentences that have 14 semi-colons and make it a paragraph. You just nailed it, crushed it. Thank you for being with us on  Unlocking Us,  and congratulations, your book is just sitting there, found a little comfortable position on the  New York Times  bestseller list.    SPEAKER:  It’s crazy. It’s still there.    SPEAKER:  It’s crazy-good is what it is. It’s crazy-good.    SPEAKER:  Thank you, thank you, thank you. So good to finally talk to you, Bren é .    SPEAKER:  You too, and I am sure one day I will see you in person. I love it, and I will end with saying, H ook  ’ em, Horns.    SPEAKER:  Hook  ’ em, Horns.    SPEAKER:  What a man. A generous soul, a straight talker, a courageous conversationalist, of course, a Longhorn. There’s just no denying that this book is important and is making a difference. And I will never forget the anagram on DENIAL: Don’t Even Know I Am Lying. That’s painful and true, as the truth is often painful, I guess. Emmanuel’s book,  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man , is available everywhere. He’s SPSPEAKERKER, @EmmanuelAcho on Twitter and Instagram. Facebook page is the same, and you can visit www.uncomfortableconvos.com to view all the episodes.    SPEAKER:  I don’t believe we get to be the people we want to be, the people we need to be, create the world we need and want without hard conversations. And we have to show up. We have to be seen even when we can’t control the outcome. That’s the definition of courage. And I think that’s the definition of this book. Let’s get comfortable. Let’s walk the talk.    SPEAKER:  Things to remember, church bulletin at the end of the podcast. Just to remember that every episode of  Unlocking Us has an episode page on brenebrown.com. All the references, links, notes, you can find there. You can also sign up for our newsletter. We are very careful about how often we send it. You really get it once a month, and it’s got updates, everything that’s coming, everything, kind of highlights what I’ve learned from different podcasts. We spotlight different films and books and movies. It’s fun.    SPEAKER:  And right now, if you’re interested in on the  Dare  to Lead  podcast, part two of a conversation with Dr. Sarah Lewis. I cannot get enough of this conversation with her. The  Dare  to Lead  podcast is also on Spotify, free to everybody. Thank y’all for giving me your time.
