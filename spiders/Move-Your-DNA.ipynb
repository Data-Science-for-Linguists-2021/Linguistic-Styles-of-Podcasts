       " \"so if you were here, zoe, my first question would be what do you mean by backbending. and if you mean having your feet on the ground with your hands also on the ground behind you with your body arched up in between, i would say no, i would not put that in the category of natural movement as i use the term. \\xa0which are motions found in nature at a certain consistency, volume, and distribution. so, any motions say, or some human bodies can do isn't part of that definition. meaning i'm delineating between motions the body can do because of their natural hard and software motions versus motions you'd actually find ancestrally. not an outlier, per se. \\xa0and note, this isn't a judgement on a move being good or bad or anything. i just wouldn't categorize it as a movement found in nature. although as i was thinking about your question, a fun side-note for me. i don't know how it is for you listeners. maybe also if you're a cultural or physical anthropologist if a backbend has become a human movement in a particular culture, it could end up being that every culture has its own set of motions required for the success of that culture. \\xa0and a backbend could be in that group. but again, i'm just using the term natural movement differently. now if you didn't mean backbend but just extension of the spine... so if everyone stands up and if you shift your hips back over your heels. all right? so you're gonna start with a vertical leg where your pelvis is stacked over the back of your foot and not over your toes. so you're gonna start to lean back, but you're not going to let the pelvis thrust forward, right? so there's a tendency when we lean back for the hips to go forward too. so i want you to keep your pelvis where it is. keep your hips where they started. and start to lean back. i'm gonna move away from the mic. \\xa0and you're gonna start extending your spine. so you will, this is where it gets a little bit challenging. you're not going to let the rib cage thrust. your rib cage is going to rotate backwards. it's gonna sit backwards a little bit but i need you to know the difference between your rib cage tipping backwards through spinal extension or your rib cage just sliding forward at the bottom, which is - it wouldn't really be that you articulated each vertebra, it would be that you've really articulated one a great amount and the others not so much. so you are gonna still drop your ribs even as you start to lean back and into this extension or slight backbend, is probably how i would use to quantify it differently than backbend being a full arch. so this whole body's final extension motion. that's with your feet planted and you've leaned as far back as you can go. maybe even let your head go back. you're not gonna let it drop back. you're gonna control it. \\xa0but you've got that extension. this whole body's final extension motion is made up of each vertebrae extending a little bit. and i do think that this motion, vertebral extension, is natural in the sense that many movements done day to day in nature would call on vertebral extension. although maybe it wouldn't be the entire spine done at once the way we practice it as an exercise. so, if i'm thinking stack your life principles, i would say that picking up heavy things is where i use it a lot. and i'm thinking of moving rocks. we just build a rock wall from river rocks around our house. and we just got done training with the folks at movnat. and took a sort of deadlift move. i think lots of people would do a deadlift in a gym. they'll hip hinge, and they'll move forward, bending over at the hip, usually with a weighted bar and then stand back up. so we took that hip hinge to lifting and moving heavy planting pots and squash. we had some really big heavy squash. \\xa0just to think about if you're going out to the pumpkin patch, there would be a stack your life motion. so a good lifting technique uses spinal extension pretty naturally. because keep in mind that spinal extension being a natural movement doesn't say anything about the degrees of extension that are natural. so just because extension is natural doesn't imply that full end range would be called upon that frequently or even at all. so that's always my call to people studying and teaching movement. if we could communicate in terms of numbers or amounts, things would be less conflated, i think. so anyway, imagine if you were bending over to pick up something off the ground and you kind of centered your body to it, right? so there's not an element of twist yet. when you would go to pick it up, you would usually have an amount of extension in your spine. the amount of extension you have in your spine really will depend on what you are lifting and where you had to move it. but for me, that's where i will often call on the musculature of my back. and if you go back to that standing backbend and leaning back, you're not doing a ton of - it's not really weighted. that backbend is really more a range of motion. you're able to get the range of motion, but the work's more on the front of your body. \\xa0\\xa0you'll usually feel it in your abdomen. maybe the fronts of your thighs. when you're bent over though, say you're at 90 degrees with your torso to the floor ... and sorry if my voice is moving around. i'm actually doing this. i'm such a mover as i teach which makes teaching via podcast very challenging... i'm all the way down here by the floor. when you're at 90 degrees now your spine is not only going for that extension motion but that extension motion, those extensors are carrying the weight of your spine. where they're not doing it through that same backbend. so now you have a question of what ... it's not even the motion that's particularly nourishing. it's the load. right? so i can have a backbending motion that is the same as me standing, versus me, carrying a 40-pound pot. and those moves are different. and so it's challenging i think to only think in terms of range of motion and mobility. i think it's easier to think in terms of load because then you can figure out oh, a backbend is a completely different load than me being able to pick up something 40 lbs and not only carry it with my legs and my arms but to have my spine be able to extend and carry that load. so carrying heavy stuff, zoe, carrying heavy stuff would be the forward answer. and if you wade through that 3000 or 5000 word answer, well done.\",\n",

       " 'dami: oh yes. well, i mean i\\'ve walked all my life. i grew up in holland and without a car. so that wasn\\'t anything new, but it became a thing, as you said, bigger thing, when my life fell apart in my late 50s. and my husband had a progressive illness and i lost him quite soon after that. \\xa0and so when your life falls apart what better thing to do, at least in my book, is to go for a walk and clear your head and figure out, \"now what do i do with my life? how do i go about this?\" because i felt very off balance. as many older women that i talk to now, they experience that when you lose a life partner you\\'re like somebody ripped half of your body off and you\\'re literally not walking in balance. so a walk is good was one of the better things i could do. and that got me started on what incredibly beneficial walking and i went to the himalayas. i didn\\'t just like walk around the block.',\n",

       " \"katy: yeah. \\xa0i think that the end goal - the point is to kind of reclaim this. \\xa0there's a lot of terms for it - rewilding or being able to engage in nature with not much more than your physical self, right? \\xa0in the way that humans have for a long period of time. and so definitely long distance walking is a category of natural movement that we cover, and i'm just so pleased. \\xa0i have a question. i can see now how walking trekking wilderness engagement became your thing, your salve, almost, right?\",\n",

       " 'dami: well i was... no, i don\\'t think i was quite retired. i was teaching local women about - \\xa0a small class about backpacking for women. because as you do it, you talk to others, and you realized a lot of them don\\'t have the gear, they don\\'t know how to go about it. so i said i\\'ll do a six-week class. and i put material together and then i thought, i need to have a little book. you know if this is - if we\\'re gonna do this, rather than all of these handouts. so i just decided one november to just start writing a little handbook that we could use. and i wrote the handbook. i realized that doing classes as i was here locally was a lot of hard work and then i started thinking a lot more about reaching a larger audience with it. and i thought maybe i can do online seminars. and that was all new stuff for me. so i started thinking bigger, and that\\'s how the book grew. and as i was writing it and talked to my publisher, she said: \"oh you know, we need to spice it up.\" \\xa0and \"i want to hear your stories.\" i had stories in there already to encourage people. but then we added all my journal entries and really made it a book that people can just pick up, enter anywhere. that\\'s what a lot of my readers say: \"i can just have it laying there, open it up and i read something that\\'s like oh i hadn\\'t thought about that.\" or so it\\'s very accessible at all points of the book. that\\'s what happened.',\n",
       " \"katy: it is very accessible. \\xa0and i think there's a lot of people timid around nature. anytime i do a post on me being out in nature the bulk of the response is just how scary so many people find some element - whether it's bugs or weather or just some danger. they just perceive so much danger out there. so i have suggested - if you're feeling too timid, at least start reading the journals and stories of people who have overcome that fear and who have - it's not just simply overcoming fear. you've adapted. \\xa0you've increased your ability to know what nature is doing and so it is less fearful when you have knowledge. and experiential knowledge all the better.\",\n",

       " 'dami: right. i had something to say about that. about people and their fear of going out and all the different things they imagine. the truth is, i am always fearful. or i\\'m not a fearful person. but when you prepare for a big trip or to go out into the wild, there\\'s an anxiety. it\\'s like each time you have to make a transition from this sort of safe, you know, seemingly safe - these days it isn\\'t - home environment to where you\\'re unprotected and vulnerable. but soon, and this is what i\\'m so passionate about, come with me. feel it. \\xa0as soon as you\\'re walking and breathing and you\\'re out there, that fear just drops. once you have one day under your belt, it\\'s like, \"oh. i belong here.\" and that was, i think, the greatest discovery that i had that i feel actually protected by trees and the natural world. this is my world. and we\\'ve lost that in our society. people are just - they\\'ve been cut off from that. and that is so sad.',\n",
